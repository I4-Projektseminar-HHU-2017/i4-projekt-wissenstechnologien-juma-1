Something is REALLY fishy with all the extremely positive reviews of this game.I have played all the previous games of the series and i have to say this is the most boring and overrated game of the series. I've played all the previous games and i thought they were pretty good games. After 2 hours of playing i was already bored. I tried to give this game a chance and played for another 10 hours. Then i couldn't take it anymore. The story is not interesting, the characters are not interesting and many of the previous games gameplay elements have been removed. Even if all the above are just my opinion this game definitely does not deserve 10/10 so many reviewers gave it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most overrated game of all time! this game sucks so bad. I only paid 20 bucks for it and I feel like I have been ripped off. San Andreas is way better this game is so bad it shouldn't be allowed to have the GTA name.  I would recommend Saints row 3 if you like the past GTA's. Rockstar should be ashamed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hell are the critics thinking?!? This game is just terrible in comparison to San Andreas. The 2 is only for the graphics. The missions suck. The gameplay sucks. This game sucks. Hopefully the series will improve, otherwise GTA will sink as a franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Way overhyped! Not down with cop killing and prostitution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had some fun playing it but its just not the same as the other ones,it doesnt feel like a GTA game.trust me im no GTA hater i loved san andreas and vice city but this one never really made me like have to beat it...hopefully the next one will be better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WAY overrated. I... I just don't understand the praise this got from the critics. And im ashamed at the industry for placing this with legends like OOT. Hours were wasted going from place to place, killing drug dealers and stealing cars got repetitive and rather menial. The critics said that the morally aware gamer would love this... no. The more I played, the more I saw my character for the scumbag he was. and as someone who sees myself as the charcter I am playing, I felt Ill. I am giving it two points more then I want, but you have to give it credit for improvement over the other GTA games, which I was never able to spend more then half an hour on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a bad game. I was bored after 3 hours of playing it. The storytelling is meh, and you're basically driving for the majority of the time, and you don't even get a gun for a LONG time! And on top of that, you have to buy or find your health. I died countless times from forgeting that you had to find a hotdog vendor to survive. A sentence of advice, don't buy this game. Games are meant for amusement, but there was no fun in this "game". Buy Saint's Row, it has humor, wit, and you don't have to wait 5 hours to get a gun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have always been a fan of the GTA series, from back in the day when I played on PC with the birds eye view.  This was a classic series that was so revolutionary during the times of GTAIII and Vice City.  Needless to say, my expectations for this game were very high!One thing I really noticed when played this game is that Rockstar have really gone for a grand storyline- and in turn the gameplay has suffered.  The best thing about GTA was the over the top fun you could have, running riot in a city as a criminal figure.  This city to me, whilst expansive and scenic, just seemed so bland and lifeless at the same time.  There was just not much to do compared to other GTA games, and I felt myself just wanting to get through the missions as soon as I could.  In the past, i would have spent countless hours just running pedestrians over for fun, doing the little fun side missions (which seemed lacklustre this time), buying property, starting fights with rival gangs (ala GTAIIi) and just being a general pest in the world Rockstar had created for me.  This time- I felt no compulsion or need to do these things, and i put this down to the world just feeling too realistic.  Bring back the gangs so i can go shoot up their hood!Video games are supposed to be fun Rockstar- go back to your roots!Anyway, many people will enjoy this game but it may be a game you hire instead, or wait until it hits the bargain bins.  My personal opinion is that this game is the first GTA that i would not recommend buying! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is redundant in the worst way. It's just a repeat of previous versions. It's incredibly repetitive and I completely lost interest 3 hours into the game. Absolutely doesn't deserve your money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is dreadfull, the storyline is boring and repetitive, cars still look worse than vice city, acting is ok, multiplayer is a good addition but isnt layed out anywhere near well enough, graphics look a year out of date and the whole customisation area that was brought up in san andreas goes out the window!! I dindnt w8 since san andreas for rockstar do come up with this. giving it a 2 is generous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was pretty disappointed with this game. Graphics are very nice, although the filter washes everything out to where I can't really appreciate them. Music was subpar compared to previous titles although that could be my disdain for modern music, but they should have at least had an oldies station. The new driving system didn't really bother me with it's added realistic physics, it did require a greater degree of skill than previous titles but I found I was able to get it down after a while. The gun play was awkward with an inability to manually target enemies well, although I did like the cover system. I guess the bulk of my disappointment was with the story, which I found lackluster, and the actual "fun" of the game. Realism is something I don't want to see in GTA games, they have always been "arcadey" and campy. To take out all the fun little details that have made past games so engaging is the height of stupidity as I see it. I bought this game right after it came out and I got to the end of the game and lost my desire to even finish it, it sits on my shelf collecting dust. I give this game -200 pigeons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its a good game overall, gorgeous and fast cars, funny at times but one of the biggest cheats i've ever encountered when it comes to missions. very dissapointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I actually liked the driving. It's cool how the old junk cars (i.e. Roman's Taxi) can't handle worth a damn and the wheels lock up when you brake traveling at high speeds and the fancier cars (i.e. Coquette, Comet, Infernus) handle like a dream and seem to have ABS. I also liked how varied the buildings are. If you take the time to look at them there aren't very many that are identical, and little things like graffiti add to the atmosphere. But where is the comedy? Where are the properties? With such a massive variety of buildings, why can't I enter the vast majority of them? Where is the sprawling landscape? Where is the national guard? Where is the mission variety (you can either "drive here" or "drive here and kill this guy" or MAYBE "follow this guy then kill him and his friends")? Why are there clothes stores from San Andreas that I'm not allowed to enter? Why do these stores have online shops I can't buy things from? Why don't I get unlimited ammo after I beat the game (I mean, 8 rockets, seriously)? What's with the ending? Did I put up with all that monotony just to lose? Why can't I take over Pegorino's house after he dies, with the two garages and and a house with a helipad right around the corner? Why do I have to spend time taking my 6 friends to one of 7 or 8 generic tasks just so they'll like me enough to help me out (if Rockstar was shooting for realism, saving Roman's ass probably would have been enough reason for him to give you free taxis, same with Little Jacob for the cheap guns)? In San Andreas, there were 3 unique cities with a massive country landscape to fly over/drive through in between. In GTA 3 and Vice City, you were confined to a city but the atmosphere was so light and fun that you felt like you could do anything. GTA 4 restricts you to three identical-feeling islands, covered in high-rises and skyscrapers, and once you get over how fun the ragdoll effect of running over people is, you begin to feel absolutely limited to what you can do. I waited the entire game to get an option of something to do other than the safehouse, a date, or a mission. I never got it. If you've never played a GTA game before this title will absolutely blow your mind, but anyone who has played either third-person game in the franchise will be left feeling ripped off and disappointed due to the complete lack of new features (or even old features for that matter). Long story short: if you have a backwards compatible ps3, get the GTA trilogy. If you don't, get a used ps2 and get the GTA trilogy. Each title in this set offers hundreds more hours of enjoyment than GTA 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Over hyped. A plain game pagued with framerate issues and bad gore effects. Ohh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+first few missions are fun +its fun to drive, even with the horrible vehiclecontrol -Horrible Vehiclecontrol -Horrible Shootingmechanics -Bad graphics, even for 2008 -Boring Story -Only Hacker/Cheater in Multiplayer -Multiplayer is very bad designed. You need like 10 minutes to get in a game -Bad Police/Crimesystem: Police will come after you, even if they never saw you doing the crime
-No other environment than the City.

2/10

Sorry, but 98 is just ridicolous. Im a huge GTA fan, but this GTA is not good in my opinion 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a good game, but the media reviews are totally over blown, it has plenty of flaws, and the aiming mechanics are sloppy. Funnier still is how everyone points this out yet still gives it a perfect score, it's pathetic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm surprised of how people think of this game. Such a piece of trash. The worst in game driving I've ever played. If it was a game that driving is just a tiny part of it, that would be kinda forgivable. But driving in this game is a big part. The most stupid AI for this gen system I've ever seen. I run the red light in front of a cop and nothing happens. But if I park on a side walk the cop will run out and start shooting at me. other drivers drive like they should not pass the driving test at the DMV. Some story line makes no sense at all, people don't forget how to speak their language for living in the US for only 10 years. In fact it's impossible to forget their native language when they still have an accent that strong speaking English. I wish this game was XboX exclusive really, coz this game really fit with their exclusive trash collections. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here is a summary for those who don’t want to read the whole review (the review contains spoilers).
+Very Strong Opening
+ (At the time it was released) Good Graphics, but that is not worth shouting about as graphics quickly become out of date.
+Mini games (e.g. bowling) are well pulled off.
-Very repetitive missions, with next to no variety making the game boring, as you go to a location kill someone/or collect something, 50 times.
-Virtually no customisation, which makes your character feel no different from start to finish, reducing the level of fun.
-Very annoying aspects like terrible driving.
-Boring combat
-Very average story, with limited variety.

In short buy Saints Row 2, Sleeping Dogs or even Gta San Andreas, these games are far superior, and are more fun. Gta 4 is worth a rental at most.

Full Review
The start of the game is very strong, as you become immersed in wanting to find out about Niko Bellic and how he struggles to find the “American Dream”. The graphics (at the time it was released) were of good quality, giving the game the look of a next generation grand theft auto game.

However you quickly realise that the game falls flat on nearly every level.

One of the annoyances of the game you will notice very quickly is the driving, which while fun at first, proves to be a dump on your front door step. This is because all vehicles feel very similar and under steer like  or if you apply too much throttle over steer like they were on ice. The use of toll gates and crashing every five seconds resulting in you falling out the windscreen, only serve as the bits of sweet corn in the dump on your door step. Such a terrible driving system, further serves as a reminder of how much Rockstar have removed from San Andreas, because the driving in that was insane and FUN.

Another annoyance is how there is nothing to spend your money making it pointless. Unlike in previous games where you could buy property and businesses making you feel like a bad ass overlord, in Gta 4, you can buy clothes, a few guns (less than you could get in Gta San Andreas) and food. This is something you will notice as it adds to the lack of depth in Niko, as his primary motive is money, yet he can’t spend it on anything so what is the point, in him risking his arse every 5 seconds.

Another of the many annoyances is the character interaction. Your uncle (Roman) is one the most annoying characters in gaming history, constantly being a little  Jacob is a walking, talking serotype as is Packie, (and his whole family). However the worst character (unfortunately) is the one you play as (Niko). He is basically a black stale, and while Rockstar tried to add depth to his character by revealing his story of being a former army solider gradually, ultimately it amounts to nothing of interest, demonstrating a lack of depth to his character.

With regards to the story, there is nothing ground breaking here, as it is your standard revenge story, nothing as gripping as Sleeping Dogs which was predictable was still enjoyable. The only really noticeable moment of the story is the choice at the end (Spoiler alert) where you get to choice if Roman dies or Kate dies by undergoing one of two missions prior to the event. However it falls flat, as you want to kill off Roman, but if you do Kate disappeared, making it better to keep the annoying prick (Roman) alive over the only decent character in the story (Kate). Furthermore the choice has no impact on the actually ending, making it rather pointless. I can see where they were going, trying to make it a dark and quite depressing story, but honestly with all the annoyances of Niko, I couldn’t care less about what happens to him. This ultimately means that the story, like the game on the whole, falls flat.

However possible the main problem with the game is how there is NO variety in anything. This can be seen by how in the following areas GTA 4, has limited variety, Missions (in Gta4 you virtual go from location to location killing people, with minimal challenge as the Enemy A.I have a tendency to just peek out of cover exposing their heads making for easy head shots or suicide charge; and no build up. In San Andreas there while Enemy A.I is retarded the variety of missions make up for it), Customisation (in San Andreas and Saints Row 2 you could get tattoos, haircuts, and tons of clothes; in Gta4 you can only buy a limited number of clothes), Vehicles (in San Andreas and Saints Row 2 you had tons of vehicles and planes, in Gta4 there is only like 3 helis and no planes).  This lack of variety makes it so it feels that Rockstar removed all of what made San Andreas so great, and replaced it with mediocrity dullness.

All these mind-numbing elements ultimately make the game annoying without enough irritations to make you turn it off. This, from a studio that gave us games like Max Payne 3, Bully etc., amounts to a great disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am an avid gamer, 37K gamerscore.... But I can't roll with a game that revolves around cop killing and prostitution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are you guys kidding me saying this is one of the best games ever for one the game is wayyyyy too dark and yes i have adjusted the settings I do not understand why everyone wants open world all the time yes i enjoy some open world games but this one blew i enjoyed saints row and dead island a thousand times more 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't find this entertaining and fun. I don't mind the ability to steal cars and stuff but I don't know why it got 98/100 that is just ridiculous.  But a game to keep in mind is....................WATCH DOGS!!! you can steal cars and hack and control literally anything! The game isn't out yet but it is definantly going to be better than this! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overhyped junk.
You see:
Plot is dull and vague
Missions are repetetive and unoriginal.
Downfall of R* started here, with this lousy game.

graphx is good, so youngsters maybe be pleased, but that's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a useless piece of crap...was enjoyable for about 5missions! you can't by properties, vehicles are fairly limited over all and they mostly feel like you're driving the same thing.Graphics were crap.Sounds were crap. San Andreas was way better. Dont know why the critics thought it was so awesome.something tells me i won't be believing the "critics" anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Online on PS3? Nope...haven't been able to get online since the release and my game keeps crashing. Why do PS3 games always screw up when they are first released. I am so annoyed i want to trade this thing in for a 360 or wii... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is just....bad!! It is so buggy,so poorly executed and it make me vomit.If you are going to buy this game,do it if you are either fan of the previous games or just a big Tony Hawk fan.If you are not, do not buy the game and if you do, you will see what I'm talking about 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is game is Insanely over-rated. I'm the kind of person that rates every game on how it stacks up today, not how it was in the past. Older games can be amazing, I go back and play Megaman and the original zelda and love them, but this game is pretty terrible, having to wait for your enemy to attack just to fight and having one of the most boring and terrible lacking over-worlds ever doesn't help. Not to mention the camera is horrid. IF you want a more detailed review I suggest Egoraptor's video on the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love legend of zelda, but this game almost killed it for me. First of all, NAVI IS SO ANNOYING, this fairy always says stupid things and states the obvious 100% of the time. Second, the intro to this game was horrendous, and the entire first act was annoying. Third, the over world and transportation was annoying. Fourth, the locking system was terrible.

The second act was good, but the first act was so terrible that it ruined the entire experience for me. I don't understand how anyone thinks this game is a masterpiece. The only thing that is good about this game is the story. The overall experience is frustrating at times and some of the bosses are bad as well. I will definitely will NOT recommend this game to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One word: Boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I only give this a two because it's fun to watch other people fight the final boss. Couldn't hold my interest for any amount of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pointless game, i'd rather count my fingers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am gonna be honest. i thought this game was TERRIBLE. I remember when i first bought it i was like hey look the zelda game people were so wow about. MOM GET ME THIS. she got me it then. the cutscene was ok but i took me a hour to get 30 rupees for a shield. i went to the tree and i tried to set the thing on fire but it was litterally impossible. it also has a game breaking glitch where you could finish the game in 10 mins. anyway i did play through it some more. i liked some of the stuff but i just rage quitted at the water temple. i betcha this game hadnt got a water temple it would have got 100% people saying "Best Game EVER" and stuff like that. now te super mario 64 was revolutionary and one of the best games ever made for it. so was goldeneye. but i still cant forgive nintendo for the disaster of this game. rather play ride to hell retribution 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This looks like a fun game! Unfortunately, between the thing crashing every 15 minutes and the fixed, narrow FOV making me sick when I can play there's no way to know. Don't buy this yet, wait for someone to fix the obviously rushed port job. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played TW 3 twice now. Once with no expansion packs, then with them. Me, personally, I think TW 3 should have been subtitled Silver Platter because everything is handed to you on said piece of dishware. This is a simple, unchallenging game that offers little in the way of meaningful role-play and does almost everything for you. What the game doesn’t do for you, it instructs you how to do in excruciating detail.

Role-playing traditionally makes the player contemplate and relies on intelligence more than the speed of your thumb on a gamepad. Therefore, don’t expect Baldur’s Gate 1 or 2 here. Hell, Witcher 3 is not even Dragon Age: Origins in the intellectual sense. Yet even so, Witcher 3 is not all bad. The game has its pluses (though not nearly so many as the thirty-five million dollar marketing budget and purchased awards would have you believe). The expansion pack Blood and Wine is meh whereas Hearts of Stone rises above the rest. It is a gripping story with hard choices and harder battles and a relationship that is deftly, maturely handled. I am tempted to say Hearts of Stone is worth the purchase price of the entire game, but even its excellence doesn’t validate suffering through the mindlessness of TW 3, which is 80% fluff and takes control away from the gamer at crucial stages to display yet another stupid cut-scene 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overall a big disappointment.
On the plus side : The gameplay is solid. The open universe is consistent, well structured and quite beautiful. The city of Novigrad is big, credible and alive.
However, beyond that, the game has a lot of weaknesses :
- In terms of gameplay, from time to time you will control another character for fight scenes. Since the character is overpowered, there is no challenge and no interest to those sequences that you will suffer till the end of the game.
- The difficulty in the game is not consistent and you will find hard press to kill one lonely Archgriffin when on the other side the end boss is a piece of cake.
- The main plot is quite bad. It's not epic at all. It's not well written. It has no rhythm. The ending falls flat.
- The secondary quest are for the most part not related to the main plot. A big parf ot them are generic and very mmorpg like. By the way, this mmorpg feeling is emphasized the equipment design. Differents colors for common items, magic items, rare tiems, relics, sets. The game boast a large panel of weapons and armors with no soul and identity.
- A part of the secondary quests are there to bring back sides characters of the last episodes. However, most of the time it's a botch job and you can't help to feel that the characters are juste here to male a cameo.
- Most of the side quests consiste of getting from point A to point B to deliver something then suffer a ton of dialog where your choices will not have a great impact on the game except deprived you of more dialogue if you choose to be roleplay and refuse to do something. So you will take every quest in fear of missing some great part of the story that will never come.
- The game introduces a concept of points of interest that you can see on the map. At first you will find it interesting but it will quickly become repetitive and boring.
- Your choices and decisions have less impact in this opus than in the previous ones. Only one choice has a true impact on you game experience. Some choices do impact the destiny of countries or side characters but you don't feel a big connection to what happened because it happens a the end, does not affect your experience when you play the game. You can affect the end of the game but the mechanics behind it is very silly (when you read some walkthrough to undesrtand why you get one ending instead of the other). However don't feel sad if you had the bad ending, go to youtube and watch the other endings like everyone else. Don't play the game again since it has no replay value like the previous one (The Witcher 2).
- Some will object that a big part of the plot is the father/daughter relationship between the two main protagonists. But this relationship is so weak that its feels like a bad tvserie. It's also true for all the relationships between Geralt and his lovers.
- Speaking of choices, you will discover that the choices you made in the previous episodes have no significant impacts on the story. There are only some cameo apparitions. The saddest part it that the whole "Temeria plotline" does not take into account "The La Valette heirs" and the choices you might have made in the previous episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can see how the game has mass appeal.  It's simple to play and 35% of the game is basically a good movie that you just watch rather than play.  You have very little actual control over your character.   The unresponsive movement and zoomed in field of view are the reason I don't play console games and ruin this title for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll give a 2 for graphics ... its nice...
Controls (Keyboard / mouse) are abysmal, sluggish, lagging and whatnot... and that was AFTER the gamefolderbin***.ini modification ..

graphic are nice but really just a repetition in the different areas ... (the few i saw).
The storyline are probably great BUT i really had NO patience in waiting for it...

Go Play Skyrim instead.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

honestly it feels more like a movie than a game, the gameplay was unimpressive and easy, and i find it worse in pc than in consoles(it should be played with a controller), geralt is not that likable, most of the world is empty so it`s not as big as it seems, the only thing great about this game is graphics everything else is below average, i liked the first 2(mostly the 1st) yet another overrated game that i should of waited for a sale to buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yet again, just another over hyped game that you shouldn't waste your money on. Splatoon will be so much better. Don't waste your money on this game. Just wait till the price goes down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a really bad game.. It's maybe big but it's bad, you will buy the game but end up agreeing with me..

1. The controls are **** sometimes you cant even jump over the smallest things, the riding controls are also **** Sometimes when i'm almost death i see, where the **** is my sword.. you need to enable your sword in every fight, and sometimes you have to do that over and over while fightning the same ****ing mob.

So then how the hype.. Marketing budget, and they give people free dlc, some stupid new armor, size on your hardrive.. for a stupid armor dlc.. 100-200 mb.. yes.. just for an armor.

You will end up buying this, but i hope you will come and write your review here.. and tell the truth. Graphic are good, but the game is almost unplayable.. This game made me realize of good real life controls are.. lol 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While the graphics are quite gorgeous and the gameplay is solid, the game also leaves much to be desired.  It becomes somewhat repetative for an RPG of it's caliber, and the story is only medeocre with plotholes that show a rushed development focusing on the graphics.  It adds absolutely nothing to the mix as far as new mechanics or innovation, even ripping off others.  It has a barrel of bugs that most gamers of the past half decade have become accustomed to, but is still unacceptible and below par for the level of completeness and polish that was standard for thirty years before.
A game with no vision, only visuals. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yet another console to PC conversion that misses the mark: No FOV settings, horrible controls, grotesquely bad graphics and simply no way to play it keyboard and mouse.

I would have persisted through this game, since I've played much worse games, but nothing in the gameplay, story or progression is compelling enough to continue.

First the story: the characters are boring, quests grinding and story lacks direction or focus. Character interaction is a neverending parade of inane characters and plastic-flat conversations.

The gameplay is also clumsy and frustrating, with most battles consisting of constant roll-spamming and button mashing --  Batman game this is not.  Strategy in the game amounts to simply save scumming so that you have prescient understanding of the next encounter that will happen in the game.

I simply cannot understand how this game is this highly rated. It is worse than Alpha Protocol. Maybe everyone is distracted by the hilariously bad polygon breasts and awkward sex scenes? Note: I haven't got to those scenes, nor will I, since I stopped playing this game. I've only seen them on youtube and they are childish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played the first Witcher for a few hours before deciding, unequivocally, that the combat system was not quite as exciting or strategic as playing Pacman.  I acknowledge the substance of the lore behind the series and I admire the philosophy of the CD Projekt Red team, which is why, after hesitating for so long, I decided that I'd give the Witcher 3 a whirl.

After five hours, I've abandoned the Witcher 3 and just won't bring myself to trust CD Projekt Red again.

The combat, again, essentially requires dodging between groups of enemies or around single large ones and using the same repeated sword swings.  The animations are different but the action is the same.  While there are options to use some abilities, the fundamentals of the combat remain identical and very inane.  There are no tactical elements to combat like you would have in a turn based RPG like Baldur's Gate, or RTS games like Starcraft, or stealth-action games like Deus-Ex or Dishonored, or even FPS/Third person fantasy games like the Elder Scrolls.  The combat is repeatedly to run into a fight and dodge around with perfect timing and not get hit, which is the gameplay mechanic of a cheap, pump-and-dump console game... and such a waste of the Witcher's content.

The flaws of combat essentially ruined the game for me.  While the story is interesting, I can (and just have) read it on Wikipedia in 5 minutes to skip the drama (though I'm sure much time was put into the voice acting and animations).  Without the drive to improve the character, who (like all RPGs) expresses himself primarily through combat, the side content has no meaning and the main story-line becomes only that - a story-line.

I love that they tried to make something so epic in scale of integrated content and take the RPG to somewhere where it hasn't been before but this is still a game and the action in the Witcher is flawed at the core and has remained so through the series.  My experience with the Witcher is so frustrating and annoying precisely because I want so badly to enjoy the game but can't get past its most basic flaw - the gameplay is terrible.  The pursuit of a massive library of beautiful content is not an excuse for making a bad game.

Also, as a post-script, the merchant system doesn't make any sense.  You can sell a sword and not buy a piece of bread that heals 20% of your health... perhaps this is supposed to be how things are but I find myself totally ignoring merchants entirely.  Furthermore, the crafting system has an incredibly steep learning curve, without any hint as to what makes sense to do or not, which is exacerbated by the nonsensical merchant system.

And as a post-post-script, I really hate that I will not be able to convince myself to spend money on Cyberpunk 2077. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Witcher 3, while a vibrant and beautiful open world, unfortunately fails at what makes a game, well... a game. It is simply not fun. The combat is a mindless early Assassin's Creed rip-off. The huge, vibrant world is ultimately empty and boring. Nearly all the missions amount to you activating your special powers to follow glowing red tracks. The difficulty slider only serves to make enemies damage sponges.

The story is decent enough, but TW3 fails on the most important point: It's not fun to play, it's basically an interactive movie, not a game. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What happened to Mario? This game does not reflect the greatness of its predecessors, such as Mario golf on the play station 1, and Tetris. Like many games in recent times it suffers from a big problem, there is way too much water. The only thing this game has going for it is its deep storyline involving the girl from last of dust, and pokemon diamond. That is why Mario dream cast gets a solid 10/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Extremely interesting game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Civ four falls hard coming to the worst of the series. The graphics are about a 6.5 and only on par with other games in its class just barely better then those of Civ 3. In what they have made up for in streamlining the game they have lost in strategy. There is no middle ground in this game it is either ridiculously hard or boringly easy. The AI show little to no improvement from that of civ 2 While the negotiation is much more complex even on the easiest of level the player will find 80% of negotiations wasted and unusable. The civ knowledges are so dumb down that most of them are nonsensically as wells as their improvements they lead to throughout the game. Its hard to build cites through the map because of borders and war constraints based on the layout of most of the maps and area that each city consumes. The movies also take huge steps back compared to those of 3 and 2. The palace and animated counsel are completely missing as well as the large array of units and improvements. Civ 4 is almost an identical copy of Age of empires 2 and Total War crossed over and mashed together. How Sid Meiers could slap his name on this crap is beyond me. Over all advice is to save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay is fully identical with rise of nations and sizes are wery weird 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are a fan of the Civilization series, don't buy this game. It will lessen what you think of the Civilization franchise. It is a very unbalanced game. If you have heard the game is like Civ 2, let me tell you it isn't nearly as good. It has somewhat sloppy graphics and devote a lot of timeto finish one game. This game is either loved or hated, I sure hated it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played the game from beginning to end once, that's it. Civ 3 was amazing having me continually replaying the game, especially with the expansion. But #4? Honestly, I expected to have more race individualism, what happened, less races than #3? It didn't matter who you were really anyways. The 3D graphics weren't all that impressive anyways, just takes up more memmory to run! Don't sacrifice gameplay for crap graphics. I hope if there's a #5 that it lives up to #3's higher standards. Raise the bar! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is tedious, boring, graphically inferior, and the list goes on and on. Sid Meier is a wonderful game designer who needs to push the envelope with his next effort. Perhaps, a 3-D rendered remake of Gettysburg. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this and and found the opening credits annoying. then i set up a game and there was no scenario maps! i started the game and played. the religeon aspect didn't impress me. i soon found the combat system has gotten worse. the nicely simpley animated wariors are gone they tried to make it look real but it looks worse. the game is a disapointment. all the people that have played the recent civ's i know don't like this game. only new players like it. and that's because they dont know civ. disapointed. i am very mad that it has a better rating than 5, since 5 is great. i have played civ three for at least 1000 hrs. no im not lying. played from age 7 - 14 and i am still play off and on. this gets a F- as a grade dont be fooled by the overrated cliques. this is not CIV. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Un beat'em all très beau mais très vite lassant, on passe sa vie à chercher des clés et à s'emmerder sur des puzzles bidons entre les bourrinades sans fin sur la touche carré dans des niveaux étroits et des passages plate-forme soûlants, le tout avec des QTE de merde. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just an upgrade. 2003 is 90% identical and $30 dollars cheaper. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Way too many cut scenes, crappy story, lame combat, bad frame rate, horrible textures. Just a sup par game in every way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, I have to say this is the most overrated game i have ever played. -More BORING cutscene than gameplay. -Not about being stealth anymore. just GO in and ambush. - Useless equipment - MK II, playboy magazine, a cardboard box. Most likely, you ll only use once/never in the entire game. - Pathetic joke. They try to make funny scene but is really annoying. But i have to give it up for amazing graphics. They are very well done in many aspects. but overall the game is just disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed! It is a movie not a game! Just finished and, a part from some the technical issues, the in-game graphics looks horrible, very old gen with some horrible low texture. A part from that the interaction tooks approximatively 1/4 of the overal experience (let me say from 8 to 10 hours of real gameplay). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've given it two for the graphics - the gameplay gets a zero as there isn't really any.

For those who haven't played it here is the game in a nutshell: over-the-top (and tediously long) cut-scene followed by five minutes of out-dated 'stealthy' gameplay (which also features the worst enemy AI since enemy AI began). Repeat until end. Yawn.

Even the 'acting' in the cut scenes is terrible!!! When there are so many fantastic games on the market don't waste you money on this one - even on Platinum. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

METAL GEAR SOLID 4 has got to be the WORST Metal Gear game in the series since Metal Gear Solid 2. I wanted to play the game but after crawling and sneaking my way through a few small maps in several areas, I found myself having to suffer through countless hours of boring movie scenes. Even the ending didn't help redeem it in any way. The only redeeming factor of this game was the boss battles which I hoped would only get better after facing off with Octopus but they actually seemed to get easier and more uninteresting until the major faceoff with the two metal gears beating the crap out of each other which was definitely the highlight of the game and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was but let's be honest, the play control on the REX metal gear sucked. The last stand between Snake and Liquid where you are punching the crap out of each other was so horrible when it came to play control that I wanted to take my six axis controller and boomerang it at the programmers of this game. I am glad that Kojima will never make another Metal Gear title. What ever happened to the GREATNESS of Metal Gear Solid 3? Metal Gear Solid 3 was definitely the defining moment of the series and we should just leave it at that. If you want to not be disappointed, don't buy MGS4, it will only drain your wallet and leave you with a bad taste in your mouth of buyer's remorse. Borrow this title from any fool who was dumb enough to buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First, the biggest problem with this game: this is hardly a video game. This is a movie. It was thought as a movie, but somehow someone somewhere said "nah, let's make it a video game". To make up for this media trouble they inserted, I kid you not, more than nine hours of cutscenes. NINE HOURS. It took me 20 hours to finish the game, not being a veteran of the series, and NINE of those were from cutscenes. This is simply unacceptable. This by itself throws my score to under 5. Doesn't matter if you do every other part wonderfully, if you have NINE HOURS of cutscene you have failed as a video game developer, you are a failed movie director who somehow got someone to give you money to make a video game. This is by far the major and most stupid problem with the game.

Second part, more than half of the rest of the game (that includes actual gameplay) is extremely scripted. Point-and-click scripted. Like, things appear in your screen, aim and shoot at them. And QTEs, of **** course. I didn't almost fell asleep in these parts, but I sure wasn't entertained either.

And finally, the writing. I jump into this game head-first after all the glorious reviews I've read about it never having played another Metal Gear, so I thought this was just random crap put together. After finishing the game (only because I had bought it) I decided to look into the story. So it seems that it's not random crap put together, it's fanservice crap put together. So there's these guys, who are clones, and this guy got the arm of the other guy and so got "possessed" by the other guy, and there are these really old guys, and almost everyone dies, BUT WAIT THIS GUY ISN'T ACTUALLY DEAD, nvm he died now, the **** end. And loosely tied with straight out fanservice, they could have Kojima appear in-game and shout "THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT? LOOK, I GOT IT IN THE GAME!" from time to time. There are a lot of things that happen purely for fanservice reasons. Overall bad story, **** horrible dialogs, 2D characters, jokes on the level of kid's anime and a presentation that takes OVER NINE HOURS OF CUTSCENES to present all this ****

If you are a die-hard fan of the series and you MUST know what happens next, well, play it. Why the **** not. Just don't expect much. If you aren't, stay away from this piece of crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I seriously have no clue why so many other people hail this as one of the greatest games around. If you peel back the many layers of fatty polish on this game, all you have is a limp, tried-and-trite gameplay formula the Call of Duty franchise had sucked dry years ago. "Shoot, duck, wait for all the blood to disappear off your screen, shoot some more, blow up an objective in an elaborate manner" . If you've played one level, you've virtually played them all. I'm done here. The multiplayer is even worse. It consists solely of fighting the enemy team in an unorganized ramble of spawning right in the enemy's face, killstreak orgies that ultimately take the fun away from anyone who DIDN'T launch a nuclear missile that ends the whole game, and guns that are all so generic that they all instantly kill you at roughly the same pace: instantaneous . Although still obviously better then the object of comparison, the Call of Duty games are basically the video game equivalent of the Twilight Books. Nobody can figure out why it's so popular and critically acclaimed, but you'll be swept off your feet by an angry horde of screeching fans if you dare speak out against it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the biggest let down of the decade (bar Halo 2), overzealous review scores have really pumped this into something much bigger than it actually is. The first problem - the price. Given that, unless you want spend all your time on a broken, glitchy set of enclosed spaces online, the single player will take roughly 6 hours. I cannot believe the audacity of Activision and Infinity Ward to say that the game will merit the £55 price tag. Given you can pick up some games with around 500+ hours of gameplay for less than £20, it represents no value for money whatsoever. This game is much like a Michael Bay film. No plot, no soul, no refunds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Campaign is better than i hoped. spec opps is incredibly annoying because they had to make some of them harder than others by a mile. the multiplayer is something i want to talk about. do people that review this game actually play the MP. i mean really lets compare its mp to other big MP games like halo 3 and bad company 2. i went through the leaderboards and i went through of about 100-200 pages of hackers and 10th prestige lobbiers. try this also sit down one day and play cod for a whole day if u dont get frustrated ur on something. because people have an attitude to self-satisfaction and dont think its a team game. it took Infinaty ward 2 games to figure out that people use cage match for boosting. and they dont punish people that hack or do 10th prestige lobbiers. seeing how this game is mostly MP and thats the worst when the SP is so much better. if u disagree ur most likely one of those people that nube tube, spam grenades, use the famas, or some other stupid thing. at sometimes u have fun until u die because of a nube when ur killstreak was 23. ugh people that support this game to much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An embarassment to what should be a good game. Last time I checked, great games had both amazing mutliplayer AND single player. Unfortunately, MW2 lacks in the single player department in every way, and the multiplayer feels more like an expansion. Sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, I admit it. I was eagerly waiting for this game to come out. I soon find out, however, that Modern Warfare 2 is just that: Modern Warfare with a 2 on it. In one sentence, it is a recycled piece of garbage that Activision shoved out into public so that they can get mo' munnies. Campaign: Short, Actiony, and NO STORY. Nevertheless, the multiplayer is still exhilarating. This game also lowered my expectations for Activision entirely. What's Modern Warfare 3 going to be? More Soap McTaverish and new weapons shit? No. I will not have it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The campaing is stupid and disjointed. No "nobody makes the first jump" moments hwere. The oil rig is dull and slowcompared to the ship. No location is as good as the East Europe levels. You can't LAN in Spec Ops. Multiplayer is the most stupid set of glitch-fests you have ever seen, it's a game where campers manage killstreaks. HALO has unsurpassed multiplayer, but if you're looking for something else, try Bad Company. Modern Warfare was a stand-out, landmark game. This is more like a badly-made expansion pack - an insult to a once-mighty series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was way over hyped for what it is. The campaign is alright but nothing you would want to play through more than once. The multiplayer is what most people bought this game for and its a mess. I had my doubts when I found out you could have shotguns and machine pistols as secondaries. With all these secondaries any player can be a one man army. In previous call of duties, when you saw a sniper you knew you could out gun him at close range most of the time. Now all they have to do is pull out their secondary and blast away. Camping is my other gripe about the multiplayer. Since there are so many high level killstreaks now, thats what everybody seems to focus on. The killstreaks are what ruined this game. They took the focus off of the gunplay and made the outcome of the match depend on who can get their chopper gunner the quickest. Maybe im just tired of playing the same game for 3 years now. Call of Duty 4 was great when it came out. It seems like they havent changed much in the gameplay since then other than adding more stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

most overrated game of all time sold millions of copies because of the name on the box absolutely terrible campaign, highly overrated multiplayer with way to many bugs/glitches to exploit. This game could have been good but to be honest it wasn't it was poorly made there is evidence it was rushed to meet a deadline, the CoD series has never deserved its critical acclaim as once you get down to it they are all average shooters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game totally blows. I was really excited when it first came out, but it gets boring fast, probably because of the cheats, glitches, bugs and other stuff people found out, and because of its incredibly unbalanced weapon pallet.  Save your money, this game is not worth it. Overall, 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

a pile of crap is the best way to describe COD MW2 . the story mode sucks the enimy AI is rediculasly retarded they track you through walls when you try to sneak up on them and as soon as you peak around the corner they open fire before you can even get your sights up. your AI team is dumb as **** they run blindly out in the open and fire at enimys never hittin a damn thing as soon as you try to peak around the corner every enimy on screen that was shooting at your AI team turns on you. its complete bull **** . still no online Co op for the story mode . they canclled it at the last min . my guess why is the stupid enimy AI wouldnt know WTF to do if it had more then 1 player it had to auto lock onto behind a damn wall and just shoot them selves in the damn head. the online... i wouldnt touch it . i like COD4 online but thats the last of the COD games i wanted to play online . im glad i dont care any more for this game online any more because i heard from all my friends it was garbage , 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

COD4 has been raped by the franchise's most overrated piece of **** sequel Modern Warfare 2. Words can't even describe how terrible this game is! The worst Campaign in Call of Duty in HISTORY! It's so retarded, confusing, and pointless, which took me an hour and a half to beat! Some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in video games. The characters are cliche as hell, and no character development so you don't care for them at all. The most unrealistic, contrived ending to any video game I've ever seen. The multiplayer is so god terrible, that I would rather watch Battlefield Earth! Yes Modern Warfare 2 is a prime example of how a video game should not be hyped. Overall, not as bad as World at War, but still one of my least favorite COD games. If you loved COD4, don't, you won't like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With bland multiplayer, and a rather dull gameplay engine, Modern Warfare 2 is not only boring and unfun, but downright stupid. The story to it has got to be one of the worst I have very had the displeasure of viewing, but is so tasteless I cannot bear to type this anymore. This game is overrated and awful. What keeps this at a two is that it at least works. What is funny is that in a game about shooting generic foreign bad guy after generic foreign bad guy is that the guns feel lousy and the shooting is unfun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total, complete, utter let down. Probably the most over-hyped game ever made. Fair enough, I've got a copy, and I've played it a lot, but I till can't justify the money I paid for it. The single player was completed twice, on both normal, and then staright after on Veteran, in a single sitting, on the launch day. The multiplayer is badly programmed and entirely unbalanced for weapon usage and physical ability. Being able to wield two shotguns like they were water pistols, the awful over-powering of some of the MGs, maps that allow players to jump through walls and it still doesn't get a patch is unbelievable. As always there are redeeming features. Map layouts and sizes are good, adding the extra storey to buildings to give a new dynamic to the play. But the perks are alright however the killstreak perks aren't at all balanced. And the amount of cheating is unbearable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oooooooooooooh this game.... Oh ho ho ho HO this game... Worst Call of Duty game ever made. Bar NONE. On the plus side, you get the very well done and very well executed Campaign, with some very intense Stealth Missions, and probably the most controversial mission in any game ever. And by God was it awesome. Also going for this is the climax of the final mission. I won't spoil it for the seven people who haven't played it yet. Just go look it up or something. On the flip side... you get the annoyingly hard Spec Ops and the worst multiplayer experience I have ever had on a console. Let's start on the Spec Ops. There's nothing terribly wrong with this, but it's annoyingly hard, even on the easier missions. Having two people doesn't help either. So, it's not a very solid game mode. And then the multiplayer... god DAMN this game. It's has now set the bar so low for any online multiplayer experience after this that I can now find a game that is actually worse than MAG's online. And believe me, that was tough to find. Every aspect of the multiplayer was done HORRIBLY. The weapons are overpowered without stopping power, The maps are complete JOKES of themselves, and to top it all off in the proverbial **** of Call of Duty multiplayers, they capitalized on quickscoping even more. I'll say this right now, if you enjoy quickscoping, more power to ya. But quickscoping and trickshotting can die in a FIRE. I don't want to jump on a Search and Destroy match to see scrubs doing 360 YY temper fade shots off the crane on Highrise and **** themselves when they hit a lucky shot. And, I feel the need to harp on this even though so many people have before... NOOBTUBES. Noobtubing deserves all the hate that it gets, plain and simple. So, all in all, this game is a gigantic slap in the face to anyone and everyone who liked Call of Duty. While the campaign is very well done, the Spec Ops is lackluster, and the multiplayer is a devil spawn sent from hell. I do not recommend this game unless you are the most patient person in the entire world. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is by far the worst Call of Duty ever made. The campaign is so bad and needs work and the story line is crap. The multiplayer is even worse than the campaign with campers, no scopers, quick scopers and people using cheats. Spec ops is easily innored and boring as hell.    Campaign  3/10    Multiplayer  1/10    Spec ops 2/10    Mw2  2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just like Robert H. said, biggest let down of the decade. (As far as games, at least.) The only reason I even gave it a 2 is because the campaign is the only good thing about it. But the multiplayer? Where to start...the guns are overpowered, WAYYY too many campers(and boosters). And not only are there a lot of annoying kids, there are some people who just run around knifing people. And I just finally stopped when I was trying to have a good game of free-for-all, and suddenly a nuke is called in from a freaking booster. Overall, this game is S**T. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is this even a debate? I love war games and shooters like Bad Company but the Modern Warfare series is so overrated and generic. Sure its got a good multiplayer but multiplayers been around forever and there are no new, standout modes of multiplayer in these games. The only thing that is pretty damn clever from a marketing standpoint is the perks system. Its there to get people addicted. Do I even have to talk about the single player? the story is clearly the most generic plot to be produced. But there are only so many options when making a realistic war story line so I don't blame the makers. When I say this to my friends, they look at me like I don't know what I'm talking about. Like I haven't played it. I would give this game a 7 if it wasn't for all the annoying people that only talk about how innovative (false statement) the Modern Warfare series is. If they mean innovative by recycling boring plots, then yes, this game has it in spades. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know, where do I start? The lack of dedicated servers for PC is the biggest kick to the balls for most PC gamers, and the lack of modding, tweaking, and pretty much anything that isn't specifically in the console version didn't help. I am still completely dumbfounded by this decision, and while it seems pretty obvious to me that they probably took it out to encourage more people to buy the console version, I must point out that not only will resorting to such tactics push many more people away than it draws in, there are a lot of us out here that will never start playing FPS games on a console because of the terrible control scheme compared to the mouse+keyboard setup. The forced FOV of 65 degrees adds insult to injury and makes me want to vomit, not just because I have to play with blinders on, but because apparently this was quite purposeful and will not be fixed; whether this is to appease the developers' morbid sense of justice or just because they were too lazy to make a decent port to PC I don't know. So until they give a good reason for all this, I'll just chalk it up to a downright Machiavellian sales strategy. The other problem that I have with the game is the whole "game" part; the single player campaign lasts a grand total of 4-5 hours, the AI somehow seems to have gotten worse, the story feels like it was ripped from Cold-War propaganda, not to mention that the game feels like an army recruitment circle-jerk. I will say that the graphics are quite decent, and while they aren't anything spectacular, they are a bit of an improvement over MW1. Another problem I had with the game is that there's no way to turn off in-game music short of forcing it off by renaming the folder it's stored in. I have no clue why they couldn't have added a "music" slider to the options, but maybe that would have pissed off Hans Zimmer. To be fair, I like the music, but I would rather hear the people shooting at me and therefore I generally turn it off in FPS games. Now, if they had implemented the music in a less obtrusive way, a la HL2 or something where it would be used to hone the import of a certain situation, I would have liked it a bit more, but they just plastered it all over the campaign in what I suppose was an effort to make the game feel even more 'epic.' Of course, there's still much more to be said, like the awful idea of dual wielding and magically bullet-proof riot shields, and of course the bomb-squad hulks, or the fact that apparently the weapons in the old one were too boring and realistic, so they felt the need to replace most of them with tacticool shooting range guns. I still laugh every time I see a Russian soldier carrying an IMI Tavor TAR-21 made by Israelis, but that laughter quickly is subdued by the realization that they haven't added a single Russian gun; no AN-94, no PKM, no AK-74 or AK-107, no VSS Vintorez. Aparently the Russian guns aren't futuristic enough. Anyways, semantics aside, it's probably a good console shooter, if by some chance you are lacking those, but the PC version has been stomped into the ground by the money-hungry team at IW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I started to play this game it was brilliant, but after I finished the decent typical anti-Russian campaign, I went on multiplayer and I got bored in a few hours and there are few differences from the previous games. The multiplayer is spoilt by people who think they are the best, the game is also spoilt by hackers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor, poor game.  It's a shame, because I was looking forward to this.  The graphics are good -- certainly a fascinating application of 3d means to 2d methods.  The controls are clunky, the menus are bad, and the music...my God, the music.  It is easily the worst game music I've ever come across.  This was a real disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I normally don't post on forums, but having just sold my SF4 copy to Gamestop for $30, I feel compelled to speak up and warn wary buyers. Clonic M. above summarizes this game's problems well, so I'm just adding to on his comments, which I fully adopt here: -unresponsive controls -SLOW loading times (yes, even after installing 2GB of data onto the hard drive), which you have to endure after every match -stupid menus (you'll enjoy this while going into the moves list in practice mode) -did I mention that the controls are unresponsive? this is why you have to mash the h*ll out of your directional pad just to do a simple hadoken. In conclusion, RENT before you buy...which you probably won't until the price drops significantly below $60. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Big, blunt vapid world inhabited by simple and shallow characters. Cliche, repetitive plot with no deep or subtle meaning. The game is shiny, but the actual design is poor. Once the bloom fades it can be seen for what it really is: totally uninspiring fast food for the masses. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just thinking of the sheer artistic talent and work that went into designing this game makes me very sad to see how lackluster the story, combat, and well, the entire game are. I have reinstalled Oblivion about 6 times now and tried to force myself to play it. Each time I do the Dark Brotherhood and Thieve's Guild quests and then quickly lose interest. I have never been able to stay interested long enough to even finish the main story line but I hear it's about as long as some side quests in the game are. And when you're done you're left with a vast world of copy-pasted tunnels and villages and the same fields of grass over and over again occasionally interrupted by some ruins which rapidly become repetitive as well. Overall, I am giving this game a 2 merely out of how pretty it is. The combat is atrocious (mouse button 1 swing, mouse button 2 block - AMAZING FUN!), the voice acting is mediocre at best, and the UI is utter garbage and it is cumbersome to do anything with it. Oh, yeah - the NPCs are supposed to be extremely interesting with daily needs and things like that. They're still dry and boring, just like Morrowind! Only in this game, they have random impossible-to-believe conversations witih eachother such as follows: NPC 1: Did you hear about that Gray Fox thief? NPC 2: Yes NPC 3: Bye now Wow! Cool! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Am I crazy? Or is this game 10 years behind a game like Ultima 7? Horrible, broken character leveling system with all monsters and loot leveling up with you? Lame, discount-fantasy-novel story and unmemorable characters and dialogue? This game is even a huge step down from Morrowind and even farther step down from Daggerfall! What is going on here? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe all the fellatio for this game. I played this game for some time, and yes, I had fun. There were a few good points such as: some inspired side-quests, graphics, combat and horses. However, the lack of gameplay started to set in and I'm not going to touch this game again, ever. The things that ruined it for me were: the voice acting (Patrick Stewart being the exception here), a crappy main plot, levelled loot, levelled enemies and a lack of books. It doesn't matter how pants-creamingly awesome your graphics are if the actual game sucks moose dick. If you want to play an awesome RPG, play Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't understand all the 10/10 ratings here. Quests and caves are more interesting than that of Morrowind, but that's where the good parts end. Boring samey world, boring characters, boring story, boring combat and utterly terrible levelling system. Graphics are ok but I suspect they were toned down for actual release to run better on lower end PCs - it takes a while to edit the various files and install mods to get it looking great again. Radiant AI is hilariously broken and basically offers the only entertainment this game has to offer, apart from maybe the Dark Brotherhood missions. It's bizarre that they hired Patrick Stewart and Sean Bean to do voices (although both are underused and mostly uninteresting) then hired about three more to do every other voice in the game. Despite all the assurances I'm pretty sure Fallout 3 is gonna end up a massive disappointment for pretty much the same reasons - Bethesda just haven't a clue on how to make a truly engaging and interesting RPG. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of most overrated games in history.  It had nice graphics when it lasted (i  bought and played it on release) but honestly... nothing else. Terrible gameplay, fighting, same 2 or 3 voice actors for every character. linearity, terrible character development and world leveling systems, very mediocre plot. Playing as melee classes is boring clicking of one button, well mages do not differ much from this. I cant understand that unfounded cult surrounding this title. I do not recommend this game to anyone, its boring, anticlimactic and rly overrated.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Atrociously bad game. i was real disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is boring and clunky. The movement is slow and bouncy/floaty. You can't sell things without a stupid mercantile skill. Everything is tedious. I can't believe an online mmorpg loads and runs faster than this bloated boring game. Oblivion is terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is very boring and very repetitive. Reasons below. Side Quests: Type 1) Fetch an item from dungeons. Type 2) Follow someone and watch what they're doing. Again, and again, and again. Main Quest: Must enter "Oblivion World" and fetch 'sigil stone'. Again and again and again... Levelling: Unintuitive and tedious. Bad combo. Combat: Like a first-person shooter, using sword or spells instead of a gun. I wanted an RPG, not a shooter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

falls short on expectation extremley repetetive and nothin new. Good graphics doesnt mean good gameplay.  very disappointed when it comes to the other series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The ridiculous level system means that things will always be an even match with you... so whats the point of even leveling up? The voices are horrible! The beggars have about 4 different voices which keep changing every sentence. Theres probably about 5 voice actors in the whole game. ALL male nords and orcs sound the same! I cant believe this game has a higher score than proper RPG's like KOTOR. The only thing good about this game is the graphics of the countryside when you travel from town to town... oh wait! theres no point! you can just 'fast travel' which instantly takes you from one part of the world to the other. wtf is the point of buying a horse then? In conclusion, bad AI, no immersion, bad combat, bad physics and bland quests.

Great graphic does not necessarily mean that it is a great game. The original game is already terribly difficult enough and this one is even worse. It is anything spetacular or difficult to make a "DIFFICULT" game??? Give me a break. I'd rather save my life and $$$. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, stop calling low raters "PS3 Fanboys." First of all, you don't see the "PS3 fanboys" (Do you see any? I don't see any) saying that YOU jacks$$es are giving it 10s because YOU are fanboys. Secondly, to the 0's, this game isn't THAT horrible. It's definitely a step up from the horrendously bad Halo 2. This version has Forge, new maps, new multiplayer modes, etc. I agree, however, that the storyline is utter bull-manure. What can you expect from a developer that has been producing multiplayer blockbusters? The gameplay is less than "stellar." It's an unrealistic shooter with incredibly unrealistic physics. It's just another FPS. This is not as good as it's hyped to be. Even the multiplayer is lacking. Sure, joining a server is easy and there's practically no lag whatsoever, but you'll constantly see your favorite maps being voted out, there is no teamwork whatsover (I know people who TK in order to get the flag and the point), and firefights are chaotic and pointless. There is not strategy involved because the maps are linear. Voice acting is pretty good though. The music is not epic. All the plasma guns sound the same. The graphics are not next-gen. If you claim that this is so, you are a very ignorant gamer who shouldn't even be called a "gamer." Jumbo-sized pixels mar the textures on EVERYTHING and they STILL haven't fixed the darn faces! The cutscenes look pretty good, but can't compare to Blizzard/Square Enix stuff. This game will last a long time...if you can stand the grossly immature kids that haunt every server. Halo 3 sees the worst of this, simply because all the dumb 8-year olds are led to believe that this is the most fun FPS ever, and it's so hyped, even preschoolers have heard of it. Local multiplayer is the most rewarding due to this and innumerable players who brag about their phalluses of gigantic proportions or who play 23 hours a day and call others "noobs" for having lives and doing something productive. This game does not deserve a 0, but it also definitely does not deserve a 10. Generic "newbie" FPS gameplay with a less-than-memorable storyline, pretty bad sounds, mediocre multiplayer, and laughable graphics make this game one of the worst 360 games released. But not the worst. There are ones like Barbie... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is good to play ONCE and single player goes from NOT INTERESTING -> Slightly Interesting -> P*SS Poor .

I regret getting this for my birthday.

If you really want to play this game, pay $7 and rent it, DO NOT BUY <---HORRIBLE GAME TO OWN 
Gets boring in under a week. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An obnoxious, uninspiring mess of a game. Halo truly is the Harry Potter of the gaming world; a generic thing at the right place at the right time. At best, I would have given this a 4-5, but the fact that it has been neglected to the point of utter indiference by it's creators and portrays itself as a masterpiece, it deserves a 2. Do not believe the hype. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a disappointment on so many levels. Graphics aren't spectacular, story is horrible and the biggest, most powerful blunder of all; the online multiplayer is too repetitive, ex. shotty snipers. And to top it off, the game doesn't even run in full HD, only 640p! Such an utter waste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

10 hours and the game was finished. Very disapointing, replay is very repeative (compared to Bioshock which offers a different experience depending on how you play your character). Graphics were good, but not mind-blowing. Bungie disapointed me. I enjoy the team playing, but not being an online gamer I don't think I get even 50% of what the game offers. Bungie put a lot of time and effort on the online money grab, and did little on the main story line. Again, diapointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

great game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game, nothing original. There is no real depth to the single player and it may just have the dullest multiplayer of all time. This is just a pollished up marathon. For the amount of time it took to develop and produce this game only leads me to belive you were to busy concentrating on what the competition were doing. Innovation not Recreation is what modern gamers want!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

highly overated, and extremely repetitive. i hated the first one due to the level with the mutant like things in the dark being the same section repeated over and over again with no change, boring and repetitive, second halo was an improvement, but for this game being on next gen console, what the hell is different, fair graphics considering what other chois]ces we have, and same old gameplay, short and dull single campaign, and multiplayer maybe good but what the hell are people without online supposed to do? its obvouse the makers only cared about their online gamers and nothing for the actual game itself 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute crap.  I have to say that Halo was, outright, the most fun I've ever had in an FPS.  I absolutely hated Halo 2 and this 'revolutionary' FPS known as Halo 3 is just a shinier version of the second installment.  Extremely repetitive.  It doesn't feel as natural as the original (same problem with Halo 2). No real innovation.  It's all gimmicks.  In the original, the storyline wasn't even important because the game was so damn fun.  Storyline is important in RPGs, not FPSs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My real vote is actually an 8, but I give it a 2 to counteract the fanboys who say stuff like "HALO 3 ROCKS.  10".

Halo 2 did such a great job introducing new elements eg dual-wield, cloak armor, play as arbiter, prophets, brutes, drones, very good twist on storyline and managed to let you relive the "wow" feeling of the 1st one.

Halo 3 - graphical leap isn't what it should have been, considering 360.  New gameplay elements like bubble shield etc are under-utilized (vehicles should bounce off), way fewer movies that either filled narrative gaps or added immersion.  Last level = very fun, but identical to Halo 1's last level which was fun.

Bottom line :  What did Bungie spend 3 years doing, honestly? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Umm, doesn't it seem weird that all the users who gave this game a 10/10  or 9/10  did simple one liners.  Don't you think its possible that Microsoft has a few pieces of .......   that are on here putting 10's up to boost it's score???  These corporations sink to ever lower levels every day. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought I got a flawed copy at first, but no, the campaign is really that short! For a game thats been developing for 3 or so years, they didn't get far. The graphics aren't all too great, you rarely know where to go, and (SPOILER) the last stage is the same as Halo 1 (escape the exploding ship in a Warthog)! And the ending of the credits, you see the Master Chief alive, in deep space, and in he went into cryosleep for 200 years (one of the halo books say how long). So he didn't die, he just got left behind! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overhyped, and overated - I just couldn't get into this at all. The most off putting thing for me was the bouncy, flimsy feel to both the player and the weapons â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yawn. Played it already. It was called Halo 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Basically all that needs to be said about Halo 3 is that its Halo 2 redone with better graphics and a few new toys. The plot of the campaign is mostly meaningless and pointless to follow for the most part. Its done nothing new and even the fps elements that it did manage to pull off have been done already, and better. But the main reason why ever buys this game is of course for the MP, which in and of itself is mediocre. There is nothing inherently ground breaking about anything in Halo. I for one don't accept the argument that the MP makes up for the poor single player. Its being hailed as such an immense achievement for the world of gaming. Shouldn't have to be excused for its poor story and game play because of all the 12 year olds that play it online What you really get when you buy this game is half of a game. Might as well save 30 bucks and buy Team Fortress 2 which is only a MP game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boris nailed it. Not bad just boring. No great inovation here just a rehash of H2. I hate the mucky feeling of moving around. It feels like you are moving in slow motion. I was really disapointed in the single player. It felt like the ending was really rushed and looked like crap. Online play is ok at best but typically it is ruined by 6 year olds screeching or loosers in their mom's basement touting their "superior" skills. (Always makes me laugh). If you aren't a Halo zombie avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im so tired of this crap. It makes me sad that a game that could have had a legendary life span dropped to this level of quality. I am dissapointed in bungie. Its average AT BEST and campain sucks (DO NOT SAY IT IS Only for multiplayer because THE MULTIPLAYER IS BAD. there are maybe 3 good maps that could have been added to halo 2 for 7 bucks. IM gonna return this trash before i throw up 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was v.disspointed with this game. Graphics are below average, the A.I is boring, enemies just stand still and shoot or stand still and dont shoot. Multiplayer is okay but still eons behind PC FPS online games. Killing in this game is a skilless and bland excercize. Any gamer who has played a lot of fps will see this as very outdated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was hyped as hell, but was a letdown. Seriously, the story is the same damn thing the whole damn game. Shoot these guys, go on, shoot these guys, go on. NOTHING interesting at ALL during the game, the cutscenes are alright, but the game itself lacks in quality. The AI is extremely retarded. I've found that enemies round around more than they shoot me. There is no puzzle whatsoever, it's just run and shoot. Multiplayer is annoying, I mean come on, grenades that stick to you? Also I have not even touched Xbox Live because of the kids that are in every server who screech down their mics like 5-year-olds. From what I've seen, get something else instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i use to like the halo franchise but halo 3 made me loose all respect for the franchise, the whole game took me 6 hours to complete and 7hours to complete on legendary mode. This whole game feels nothing new just the same old shit that i have been seeing for the past decade. Ive pretty much had it with multyplayer, even though it is fun with your friends but everytime i play, i run into some dumb little kids that do nothing but trash talk , plus the most of the maps are crap and littered with glitches. The enemy ai is wack, most of the enemies in the game are grunts and all they do is shit themselves and run around in circles screaming like little girls, the flood are easy as hell to kill compared to the other installments, the story still cheesy and cliche, BLOW UP THE RINGS OR THE ALIENS USE THEM TO KILL EVERYTHING IN THE GALAXY. I was really hyped up for this game and in the end got really dissapointed with it and traded it in a week later and got gears of war which is better than this halo 3 trash 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Halo is and always has been an overrated game. What made Halo so popular is that it was the first PC FPS to be successfully done on a console. PC gamers had seen it done before and better, but to console gamers, it was a whole new thing. Let me put it this way. If it had been made for PC as originally intended, it would have been written off as an acceptable attempt at being Quake. However, because it did nothing new in a new territory, it became an adored icon of mediocrity. So, here we are, two agonizingly bland sequels later. Now, as I have said, Halo is average, so you'd assume I'd give it a 5/10. Yeah, that's what I'd give the first one. But it goes repeating itself in a very stuck up manner, making me resent it more and more every sequel. Halo 3 did nothing new for the 3rd time. It has got to stop doing this. The story is still terrible, the bright design and squeaky midgets completely undermine the story's alleged "war", and Master Chief still moves patience-testingly slowly. There are two things that keep this game above a zero, though, and these are them. 1. Some serious genius thinking went into hyping the game up, though that was really the only genius thinking that can be associated with Halo. 2. The multiplayer did prove itself amusing when we were at our friend's house playing it on his 52 inch HDTV (while his copy of Left 4 Dead was too broken to provide us with our usual entertainment). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. It was so bad, I feel generous giving it a 2! There was nothing new and nothing good at all about Halo 3. The single player campaign was way too short, and simply playing the single player finding out you've done all of that work to get to this sort of ending is like being shot in the face by Bungie. The multiplayer is also terrible. There was nothing new at all about the multiplayer except the new maps they had added which are trash. In general, the game play as well as creativity went down the toilet with everything else that was once known as Halo. I was expecting something godly from the very generous ratings given by these sites, but was only to be let down. It's good to see some people can actually follow what they think rather than what the market thinks. In the meantime, I'll go play a game from Orange Box or CoD4. At least they are innovative and good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing impressive, at all. No big changes, I'm not even "wow"ed the slightest. Halo 3 is just a rehash of a rehash. It does not live up to the giant pile of hype about it... Hopefully halo 4 wont come out to dig itself into a deeper grave. The only good thing out of this would be better quality red vs. blue episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this a 2. It has good single player play but the campaign is so short and the story makes no sense. The multiplayer is VERY glitchy and isn't even worth mentioning. Something that kills you might not kill enemies. Not skillful or reliable at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like pc games a lot but could not understand the hype around this one. The story seems to be too complicated, shooting mechanics quite boring, the wanna-be-cool graphics are no really creating a feeling of un-linear game design.. this game just could not keep me interested. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Visuals:  Basic graphics.  Poor animations.  Terrible AI  you can stand on an NPC and they just look blankly at you.  Repetitive unrealistic signage.  Crude environments that would actually be impossible to really live in.  Obviously designed to be rushed past while you bang bang blam everything that moves.  It's all as fake as a chess board.

Story:  Really very lame  various ideas are thrown into the pot with no attention paid to sense.  It's not internally consistent.  All of a sudden you get these magical "vigors" with no explanation.  Powered by "salt".  Very lazy ideas.  Vigor dispensers are everywhere, so why doesn't everyone have them?  WTF are these patriot machines doing everywhere?   The whole story of the lamb  why would you build such massively gigantic heavy statues on a floating world?  Why is there a need for SO MUCH FORCE everywhere and yet residents act like there is none?

Shooting:  Really all there is to it, bang bang bang.  Enemies act completely stupidly and predictably at all times.  This game really shows a totally simplistic and ugly American view of life in this world.  It's quite sick really.

I hated it and if you loved it don't expect us to be hanging out together anytime soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a lot of people have said, overrated and over-hyped.

The story takes itself too seriously and ends up making no sense, trying to stand out but failing. Gameplay is very bland, giving you limits on how you play the game. Vigors (the new plasmids) are completely irrelevant to gameplay but only a few times. The sky rail mechanics are broken and should not be used at all if on higher difficulty.

I hate how people are so blinded by JUST the story and Elizabeth, who is the only interesting character in the game. Booker is a boring, static, and cliche protagonist. The AI are absolutely retarded when fighting. The handyman is the only exception to the bad enemy AI.

Graphics are bland and covered by bloom, hdr, and lighting effects. Textures are mediocre to poor.

The BI team obviously focused too much on story-telling to make this a top notch shooter. The only reason I gave this a two because of the good ideas and concepts (floating city, steampunk/dieselpunk style, enemy design). I hate to be writing a review like this, but I just can't get into this at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holy tired tropes. White knight much? Graphics and game play are fun, but the story is infuriatingly bad. I have refrained from profanity here, but this game inspires me to curse the armpit and pubic hairs of its designers.
Our character, the Pinkerton man, is a hired thug with the personality of a handful of gravel. We are tasked with rescuing a young woman from her literal castle in the sky, stealing her away from the zealot who has comfortably imprisoned her. SHE NATURALLY FALLS FOR US because, entitlement, really. I didn't get much further, because I can play other games with better equalized characterizations of humanity. Who wrote this piece of garbage game, /r/seddit? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pinnacle of burning trash masquerading around as a deep story with great gameplay. Terrible explanation of quantum mechanics, a failure in storytelling, a failure all around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I suscribed on this site just to write the peculiar review.

I wanted to make a point about the scenario, which was regarded as a true masterpiece by both critics and public.
I wondered.
Are people aware that they're being fooled?
The scenario is very **** This ending twist, that was considered perfect, is sadly uninventive and stupid. Thousands and thousands of stories have had this SAME STUPID TWIST since the dawn of time. Critics calling it ''the most inventive and surprising'' storyline of all time are just taking advantage of a mediatic buzz that happened around this game. Of course, calling a game ''the best of all time'' creates traffic on their pages. It's like if critics had to call out that a game is the best ever every year so dumbasses stay interested in their commentaries, which are empty of all substance.
Please stop feeding mass media.
The scenario was ****
Like really, it's just a typical twist.
No depth, characters are unidimensional.
And they're baindead.
Bye.
Don't play Bioshock infinite.
The other Bioshock were so amazing. Just discover them with a better mindset, forgetting this (bioshock infinite) crap.

Mediocre game that  on a great series.
RIP System Shock 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute Rubbish. Sorry but this is not some groundbreaking tour de force. It is a VERY boring, very very dull run and gun. It's only "deep and meaningful" if you are a naive teenager and the graphics flatter to deceive. I am stupid enough to have paid over £20 for this on pc and it is a total waste of money. You cannot interect with people you just run about shooting things and suffering patronizing "clever" storytelling. YAWNTASTIC. I give it a 3 because it was interesting for the first hour and it hasn't crashed. All this pathetic hyperbole by reviewers is actually mystifying:- "visionary", "groundbreaking"....no not at all, in fact very mediocre, unless i've woken up in about 2003.  MUST TRY HARDER 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The FPS is completely a train ride. The story and level seem to drag out longer than necessary while leaving characters purpose unexplained. The ending makes the whole story meaningless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

3 hrs in so expect minor spoilers.
This game is not only supremely boring and linear, it's also aggravating and repulsive from a story point of view. So there's this beautiful city in the clouds, where people live in (seeming?) harmony, and my job is to... kill everyone?! Violently and indiscriminately? Seriously, why would I do that? Because they're devout Churchgoers (not a big fan of religion myself btw)? Or because they haven't achieved race equality yet? Now how about changing these things through political and social means, you know, bringing about enlightenment and humanist thinking by educating people? But no. The only way to progress in this game is through mass-murder. Now if this was GTA I'd find that fun, too, but
this game seems to be wanting taken seriously.
Apart from that, it's just a very linear shooter with mindless enemies, repetitive gunfights and poor animation. Last night I actually fell asleep while playing  go figure.
A few points for the beautiful flying city, though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was not made for me. I found it to be very boring, with the same rinse-repeat shootouts without much of a break. The story line and themes were incredibly convoluted. What a shame, considering I really like the first and second Bioshock. I will however, play it a second time on a higher difficulty to see if that makes any sort of difference. I really was hoping to enjoy this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shame to see these overrated piles of rubbish appearing in this day and age.

Graphics: Bloom, blinding lightning and smoke/fog covering up low quality textures and poor polymer structuring.

Sound: Mediocre "christian influenced" music is almost dominating for more than half the game until they start to segment everything into eerie stressful, almost tribal drum music and even some quick Irish pub violin later on. This causes everything to have a very plastic feel (even though the ambiance is all good) and when combined with the seemingly random British accents, It serves only to give everything a plastic feel.

Gameplay: Halo's regenerative shield is given to you on a silver platter (literally) to fend off a moronic AI that excels at nothing but to constantly take "cover" in plain sight. The only time I got even remotely overwhelmed was when they managed to pull off zerg-rush tactics but It turns out that was my fault since I passed the invisible "spawn enemy once he's here" line without killing everything in sight first. It also serves to be a real bummer as the weapons in this game either one-shot everything or have literally no impact on anything at certain difficulties leaving the game to be extremely easy or annoyingly tedious instead of properly hard.

These maps also have to be some of the most mundanely linear things with invisible walls around every single corner which servers to be the biggest disappointment as the game is advertised to be "open-styled". But hey, gotta get the games on consoles somehow while also slurping it over half-arsed on a PC, right?

Story: Predictable and incredibly confusing at the same time as the plot throws in space-time continuums like they're verbs. Other than that, the game is simply a massive corridor filled with enemies and the occasional carefully placed camera angles to sexually expose Elizabeth as much as humanly possible. Because hey, only kids will fall into the trap to buy this game... Right?

Long story short, Buy it at a sale and get in with little in the form of expectations and preferably with two defunct eyes as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very pretty game with worthless AI, incredibly boring gameplay, a limited selection of enemy types, and more undeserved hype than you can imagine.  No multiplayer, no challenge, zero replay value.  The so-called 1999 mode is worthless to me because after finishing the game in normal mode, it exhibits problems that are simply not going to be resolved by making the game a bit harder.

The story is amazing only if you have somehow until now managed to avoid the concept of a videogame telling a story.  If this is not a shocking new development for you and you enjoy an easy shooter without a lot of demands on the player, consider this if it ever goes below $10.  Until then, save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioshock Infinite is the best example of a game company favoring story over game play. The game holds the players hand throughout the game, there is a line the player can bring up to show where to go, or you can go exploring and rummage through trashcans for food that don’t do anything for the player. If you die the game just brings you back to life where you just died with little to no consequence, even on the hardest mode available to a first time player. The difficulty in the game is just non-existent.

The story in Bioshock Infinite is the best redeeming quality for the game. The player assumes the role of Booker, who is sent to Columbia to rescue Elizabeth to pay off a debt. The real positive part of the story is more of the characters than the actual time line of the story. The game makes you actually care about the characters, but the actual content of what you are playing just feels unimportant. Add one of the most disappointing endings to a game and you’ve got the story of one of the most overrated games of all time.

The graphics are nice to look at, if you like the art direction the game took, and there is no denying that. While the game looks good, it still doesn’t play well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioshock Infinite is an awful game. It is overrated. 95 metascore? Well, they have spent a lot of money to get that score. The game is very boring. The graphics are really bad. I don't recommend you to buy this game because you'll fall asleep when you will play it. The same goes to the first and the second Bioshock 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love system shock 2 and I used to be a major thief fan as well, but Ken Levine has let me and other fans down by taking infinite's lazy route. By lazy, I don't mean that he and his company didn't work hard at all, I'm sure they did in many regards, but overall the product they chose to create was not original in the least. Despite what you'll read in all of these other super glowing reviews, Infinite is a cop out because it basically just takes bioshock and puts it in the sky but with none of the things that made that game phenominal. The story... Bioshock was about a city underneath the ocean but that was at least somewhat believable. You might be able to believe in that, but a city floating in the clouds? My first gut reaction to that was the same one I'm having now despite the fact that I convinced myself otherwise. I told myself that I probably would like it just as much as bioshock 1 even though its setting is beyond stupid but I was wrong. The game is just not believable. There are several plot holes and inconsistencies that ruin the experience. Here's one example. Booker notes early on that the skyhooks must be magnetized and that's why he jolts over to them and connects to them with ease and never falls to his death as would really be the case. That's great... Here's the problem... He then jumps off of the magnetic rails easy as pie over and over again against the very same force that supposedly is powerful enough to lift him up 20 feet for the initial connection. There are more logic defiers in the game, but we're supposed to forget about that, right? Because the story is so good... Except it's not. The story is just terrible. It feels lame someone made an imitation game of bioshock and just made it in the clouds intsead of under the sea, and it fails just as it sounds like it would. I just can't by any of the characters that I'm supposed to care about. Comstock is a lame version of Andrew Ryan who is not believable. The leader of the rebels against his city is equally lame and has a "forced" feeling to her, as if the decision was made to put this certain character in here to relate to a target audience but instead she just feels entirely fake. And Elizabeth... I knew all along that a permanent NPC tagging along the entire game would ruin it and she does. She never shuts up and she gets in the way when you're trying to run somewhere. I don't care if she has hundreds of lines of dialogue because she points out obvious crap and I don't care about her. I feel like I want infinite to be about me and my exciting adventure in the floating city, but instead it's about this annoying character's feelings all the way through. Her behavior is disgustingly predictable. First she likes you, then she goes through an omg I hate you phase, and spazes out and knocks your character out (because you're too stupid to handle yourself even though you're capable of slaughtering 500 enemies...) I'm about 50% to 75% of the way through the game but I seriously have no interest in continuing. Why should I? The story will obviously be a let down and it's playing out like a bad action movie. There are no amazing villains like Andrew Ryan or Fontaine, or Shodan. No. Instead you're supposed to fear and respect an old dude with a beard. Oh and he's a racist. Wow, let's just hit all of the stereotypical bad guy traits on the checklist. So yeah, if he's that generic and he's supposed to be the antagonist, yawn-o-rama. Mr. Levin, you SHOULD have made this game in the future in the same vein as system shock 2. I was irritated when you did the whole bioshock back in time crap to begin with but I learned to like it because you made the story worthwhile. That's not the case with this  Weird.... Thing.... *sighs* Infinite brings down the original bioshock just by carrying on its name and crushing the potential a true sequel could have realized. This thing is just an easy copy paste of bioshock with a much weaker generic story in the sky instead of under the water. It's not believable, it's not interesting, scary or heart wrenching, it's just boring. And that is the worst sin a game can commit. Please don't make another bioshock game set before 2000 AD  Seriously... Enough with this old timer music and bizarre fetishism for the 1900s  1950s. It's not that appealing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm one of the few guys who doesn't understand the score of this game. It's an ultra basic rail shooter with a poor Call of Duty-like gameplay. It's really beautiful and artistic, yes, I give you that. But is this what video games are about? They're giving 100% to an interactive movie. I'd recommend a million times Dishonored over BioShock Infinite. It's also a recent FPS, with an artistic and original visual identity. But its gameplay is a hundred times more deep. Open spaces, tons of different approaches, moral choices with impact.
Oh and, before I forget, System Shock 2, the ancestor of the BioShock series, had skills, inventory, open spaces, SHODAN (the character who inspired GladOS)... Don't you realize AAA games nowadays are designed to be reaaaaally easy on your brains? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was duped by high ratings everywhere. The fact is, this game is heavily scripted. A linear corridor shooter. Could've watched the whole thing on youtube. Am I playing the game or is the game playing me?... (You get what I'm saying).

The graphics and art style is alright but overall, I really can't recommend this game. It's downright boring!! I played like 4 hours and it's still boring!! I guess many people don't like challenges or games that requires your creativity on how to approach situations. Just follow, bam bam the bad guys, talk and follow again. Rinse and repeat. It's a first person game but it's not you, you are controlling someone else. Wut?? The npcs are talking to this guy who who happens to be you and you see him like it's you yourself but it's not you.... WUT???? OMG. Anyway, this makes you care less for everything cause you can't immerse yourself in this game. Nothing hits you or connect to you in a personal sense.

So if the story campaign is  bad what about the online segment? Well, there's none. Just a short linear single-player fps. Hmm....

SO WHY IS THIS GAME 10/10 EVERYWHERE?? It's a 2 for me. 1 point for graphics, 2nd point for 'it's not the worst game I've played).  Totally overrated.

As a regular game player I like to think I'm in tune with other game players.  But this game has proved that wrong.

I really do not get how such a mediocre linear boring game gets such a high mark from other reviews.  I tried to like the game, honestly I did .  I wanted to like it.  It is a beautiful game which is why it got some points.  But it is the same thing over and over again.  Run a bit enter an arena fight bad guys.  Run some more into another arena  fight more bad guys.  No skill in avoiding them or getting around them.  Boring boring boring.  Has it really come to this when a game like this gets top marks.  Is everyone blinded.

I really enjoyed the first BioShock.   Plenty of options to figure out different ways to get the bad guys.  The real need to conserve your precious ammo and health. All that I enjoyed of the first game seemingly stripped away.

Sorry but I really do not get the hype of this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game-play is extremely bland and unsatisfying. However, the story-line can be interesting at times. The graphics are spectacular, but round edges and water could be better. Most of the time, I am completely lost as to why I am being attacked, and who is attacking me. The actual game-play is terrible, a very basic shooter with only 2 or 3 usable guns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is liberal propaganda with overrated graphics.  If you believe the moral strutcture of our society needs a serious overhaul and need to be informed of such with subpar graphics and linear gameplay, then this is the game for you! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

seriously, why the critics gave it such a high score is beyond me. maybe because was the best game around on the month it was released? maybe due to a fetish for elizabeth? the story makes little sense and lets you down. some enemies are pointlessly hard to kill. the politics at colombia (the city) is childish. too little explanation on anything. portal was witty, comic. hitman had freedom. half life had better ame play. this had none of those. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well.. you Walk and look around, shoot sometimes and thats very much it. The Story is a bit confusing and nothing Special. Here and there it reminds me on Dishonored.
I really dont understand all the Hype here.
The only Positive things are Elisabeth, (Its kinda cool to have her around.) and the Steampunk setting.
But after all its a short and Boring Game to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played all of the BioShock series leading up to this and I don't know what this is.  It seems that some BioShock elements were used to develop a limited, hokey shooter with silly elements added to it that have nothing to do with BioShock 1 and 2.

Furthermore, the context of the story is unnecessary and unappreciated (racism...really?).  It actually sheds some negative connotations on our founding fathers and the history of the United States albeit in some "attempted" humorous fashion.

To sum it all up; if you're looking for a continuation of the epic BioShock 1 and 2 series, this isn't it.  It's a rip-off from the coattails of the former two.  Much like a horrible "part 3" of an otherwise fantastic movie series that wasn't written or directed by the team of the first two.  The only reason I'm playing through this is because I bought it...thankfully on sale. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first thing thatt came into mind was a deep dissapointment when i saw users criticizing the gale and calling it overhyped, i bought the game with expectations that it wont be able to touch the original bioshock. I am here to say i couldnt have been more wrong. When first entering columbia, i was in complete awe. The city felt like heavan on earth and for the first time playing a video game, i truly believed that this was the most remarkable city i have ever seen. That doesnt come to say it has an amazing cast of characters. Our broken protagonist Booker plays at first your typical antihero, but evolves to become a character i geniounly care about due to his relationship with elizabeth. Oh elizabeth, words cannot describe her. She truly is the heart of the game. The changes she goes through in the game is both spectacular and heart wrenching.  Seeing her evolve from the innocent girl who was locked away in a tower for 20 years  and a desire to explore the world and go to Paris to a broken girl who had to commit violent acts to escape the horrors of Columbia. Booker also sympathizes with these emotions as he troes to deperately help Elizabeth escape. The story is excellent and well paced. The gameplay is engaging thpugh at times feels limited, but that doesnt detract from the game. This game is at par or even better than the original bioshock. Truly remarkeable work andI hope that the game comes out with dlcs soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't get this score wrong, it is a very good game, well at least the multiplayer is. But the very bad propaganda against those bad old terrorists in the Arab lands where fighting is an every day thing, according to most reviewers, is very insulting. And seeing a kid pretending to be on the front line playing this, killing 'these stinking Muslims', made me give this 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The reason why my score is so low is because of how overly hyped and overrated, and don't forget disappointing, this game is. Multiplayer is the only thing which keeps it driving, the single player campaign is way too average. That's one of my beefs with the CoD series, the SP Campaigns are more of an arcade shoot-em-up instead of a real, entertaining game with an engrossing story. The graphics are way too stale, and textures are horribly undetailed. Or maybe I think that because I play too much MGS4 and Gears of War? But for a game this hyped, the graphics are a major letdown. Now, when compared to Halo, this game is better just on the terms of how even more overrated Halo is. I'd still prefer to play Halo once in a while rather than COD4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously compared to Halo this is crap! No ducking, no vehicles, no skill and basically the same level designs in multi. Its soo easy its a joke, better off with Halo or GOW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the GRAYEST game I've ever seen, it looks like they actually made an effort to use a limited color palette with gray as the base. The story mode has a bunch of twists and turns, too bad they are the SAME twist about 17 times.They have giant plot holes all across. I think the real low point of this game is the death streak. So I'm doing terrible and now the game is plastering it on my screen that because I suck so badly they need to give me an edge. Not that it matters because the edge lasts just long enough to run out a full minute before I see anyone. So lets see, I can't see anything because its all gray, and the game rubs loss in my face. Well don't worry because it still can get even worse. Normally kill streaks are determined pretty much randomly by luck... and im not saying everyone because some people get it regularly with great skills. For the most part however its luck. So, Hardline, Grenade Grenade Turrent, Helicopter, NUKE. Seems to be the common trend of this game. They seem to fail to realize that in a real warzone all this guided killstreaks stuff is balanced because there is thousands of people fighting. In a map where there is only 8 people on each side a guided missile is completely overpowered. Lets finish off this review with the fact that you can pay extra to start off with the end game gear, and whoever has the higher level weapon always wins. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, how is this getting such a high score? campaign took me 3 and a half hours!!!! Absolutely ridiculous. Does anyone remeber half life? it took days to get through and was far less linear than this. The only saving grace is multiplayer which is decent but the maps pale in comparison to cod 4. Im utterly dissapointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For what its worth, anyone new to RPG's and has never played morrowind will come to oblivion awestruck and amazed to see such a wanderful culmination of technology and talent in one tiny disc. I know, because the same happened to me when I played Morrowind (the game which came before oblivion), for the first time. But now I can see oblivion for what it really is. Another attempt at raking in the dollars by appealing to a market who only want pumped up graphics and hack and slash. Hate to say it, but Diablo 2 is more playable than oblivion. Firstly, aside from graphics requiring a chunky computer to run, The combat engine is almost always repetetive and somewhat unrealistic. I mean, if I hit a wolf with a 20 KG sword, you'd expect it to die. Furthermore, it is so clumsy come along another enemy, let alone 3 or more, just forget it. Diablo 2 lets you, WITH EASE, kill dozens. The magic system is completly the same as morrowind and is the alchemy. Items have a 1:1 functionality in that if you need to recharge an item with 800 charges, it will cost you 800 dollars in the game. Leveling up seems pointless however my biggest gripe with this game is that if you build yourself up to be a massive strong arm sword fighter (no magic), or an excellent shot with the bow, prepare to be dissapointed after 20 hours of play because suddenly all the creatures at your level require strong magic ability to destroy otherwise your sword or arrow passes right through the enemy without effect. If this is your first RPG, you may enjoy it for a long time, therefore giving the game a high score of 8. However, to the regular gamer who is not so easly taken in by all the eye candy, you will find a boring repetative game with really nothing to do and most of the gameplay carried over from morrowind, landing a pitiful and most dissapointing score of 2! A so I end this review. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll give you a heads-up now, just because it's made by the same people who made Fallout 3 doesn't mean it's any good so don't waste your money!!!

Firstly, the AI has hardly been touched. Yes, artificial intelligence is a difficult thing to program but really, when I murder the bandit on the left and the bandit on the right, the guy on the corpse should realize something is terribly wrong, instead of wandering around hopelessly. Similarly, it is brutally and unforgiving when it comes to accidental thievery. Try to click on the bartender to talk to her, and likely you'll accidentally click on an alcohol bottle. THIEF!!! she cries out, and even if you put the bottle down immediately, a guard will escort you to the castle, where you'll have to pay a fine for touching a bottle on a bar. Character interaction is annoyingly weak. To get a character to like you, you'll need to, in a brief period of time, Boast, Joke, Admire, or Coerce him/her, repeatedly, via a mini-game. Bashing heads solves almost every quest, so the talking issues in the game are neatly covered up by massive bloodshed (although corpse cleanup isn't so good; this one poor shop has had 3 naked corpses in it for months now).

Also, the main story line is, no fun. It's not just the "you start in a prison with no equipment or past" lameness that's been done so many times before. Opening up the gate from a hellish world all through the countryside, you're told things like, "You must save him RIGHT NOW" but we still have the theme of do whatever you want so the invasion or execution or whatever will patiently wait until you go off and become head of every guild, visit every city a dozen times, or do whatever else you feel like. The main quest just doesn't feel right in this context. You'll also need to close many gates, and the sense of accomplishment for doing so is a bit boring, as each close the gate quest is almost the same.

Finally, we have an overall design flaw here. Usually, once your character gets above level 25 in any game, there is nothing left to challenge you, making the whole game extremely easy. Oblivion (tries) fixes this by making the monsters and treasures as your character does. So, a cave that would hold rats for your first level character holds trolls at a higher level. It sounds nice, but it creates new problems as well. First, the thrill of exploration drops off a bit; I know the monsters I meet and treasure I gather will all be set to my level, there's no danger in encountering something far too tough for me to defeat with a simple thumping, and there's no thrill of finding a great artifact far outside the power of my character. Second, the non-player characters generally aren't leveled. A number of missions grant you help from additional soldiers and such. If you're too high a level, the monsters you encounter will toss those soldiers around like confetti; leaving you all alone to deal with a horde of monsters (at least you can loot the soldiers corpses for extra gold). Curiously, the best counter to this is to design a character that does NOT go up levels. By basing your character around little used or unnecessary skills, you can get a character that goes up levels at a slow enough pace that you can see all the game has to offer; go up levels too quickly, and you'll miss many monsters that simply won't appear for high level characters.

So like I told you at the beginning, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! (The only reason I gave it a 2 was because of the lovely graphics!) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is absolutely atrocious, i can't believe the way people r raving about it. it has nice graphix but ist incredible boring to travel around in the games world bashing wolfs and crabs, the combat system is a disaster to say the least. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a disappointment - The so called "Radiant AI' does not exist. NPCs talk the same rumors over and over again, get stuck at each other and - The graphics are awesome... in a radius of 10 meters around the character. Texture lodding creates huge, ugly blobs on the ground in the distance. - Loading hitches every few meters. - Grass growing only in a 15 ft radius around the character! - Cities are empty. No more than 5 NPCs in most places, half of which are guards and have the same voice and text - The translation (german version) is horrendous. The worst I have ever experienced in a game. A scroll of healing is listed as "Schr. d. schw. H." on the GUI. WTF?. The game also tells you outright wrong numbers when you try to buy a house - The game is totally unbalanced. My level 1 character can kill everyone by just getting them follow him and constantly casting spells. - The UI sucks. - Load times are horrendous. - The horses in the game are weak and die easily. That is very convenient, since Bethesda just announced that you will be able to buy horse armor from the XBL marketplace... great idea ... NOT! All in all this is a major disappointment. The game feels half finished and I can not recommend it to anyone. Maybe waiting for the platinum edition or maybe a patch through XBL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I stopped playing within the first 10 minutes because: 1. The "training mission" that might as well have never existed 2. The very clumsy controls 3. Most importantly, the lighting that made the game almost painful to look at. I didn't even get to what some have described as a lame story/weapons selection/dialogue/etc. Save your money; go buy the Orange Box or COD4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I must be a jaded gamer now. This is the first time I've ever bought such a highly rated game and felt so let down. Maybe I just find the game boring and the controls terrible because I play pc games where the controls are precise and the action faster and more interesting. The graphics didn't wow me, the terrain is all flat and it's nearly impossible to distinguish enemy foot soldiers from your teammates. And everythign in the game is either metallic or brown. The duck and cover game play is not only repetitious but extremely buggy. Melee is pretty wonky. And perhaps the most unforgivable thing about the experience is that after exactly 7 hours of owning the game I had beaten it.. At least coop was kind of fun. Maybe I've been around too long and played too many games but I can honestly say I had MUCH more fun playing the new Zelda and Final Fantasy this Thanksgiving. At least I expect the resale value of my GOW to be relatively high. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The controls on this game SUCK!!!!....im sorry but good graphics do not = good game.....i cant believe that no one else has stepped up to say how bad the controls are on this game.......the berserker battle is retarded....im getting killed because i cant control where my guy runs to and when i am stuck on a wall he just jumps to another one and bomb dead.......i have really tried to give this game a chance but the controls are just not where they should be......come on this is not a game to compare to Halo....and for the record i wasnt the big of a fan of Halo but it least it was playable!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thoroughly average. Tried and tested game formula is finally getting tiring. All the separate components are nice; graphics, music but is just held back by such repetitive gameplay. I could play this again for an hour and not need to play more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yeah, I kind of understand why people would like this Macho-man Randy Savage **** simulator.  But Frankly Mr Shankly, I think its easily the blandest video game I've ever played.

Its just so god-awfully hollow as a game. Sure the multiplayer is rather enjoyable, but the setting, dialog, characters, environment is just so **** bland, I mean we never really get to understand or emotionally feel invested in the struggles of the characters as they basically act as these walking talking beefy buff **** who basically slaughter the **** out these Aliens, of which I have no real idea as to why they feel as if its a necessary to take over earth.

God I just really didn't enjoy this game I know visuals shouldn't be an aspect as to why not enjoy a game but the murky bland environments that are just grey is so ugly. I just really disliked this game.

Like if your into hardcore bromance shooters pick it up and play it, by all means yall have a blast. But if your someone like me and really like beautiful colours and an interesting suspenseful story, with innovate gameplay, its not for you. I had no fun with Gears of War, absolutely none. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing but a Gears of War clone. A 10 hour RPG (if you can call it that). No exploration what so ever. Everything straight forward. RPG for a 10 year old. Holds your hand. Nothing but shooting and the shooting isn't even fun. Stupid conversations that take you nowhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really a good game but with tremendous bug and what is unforgivable two months and a patch after the release and still the same problem: five save files  and 28 hours of gameplay gone away along with my 70 bucks 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics look quite nice but that's about it. A few of the old characters are back from ME1 but the acting is very wooden and the things that wowed you graphically (like realtime rendered cutscenes) from ME1 just dont cut it now. The game itself is appalling; They've expanded on the really lame things in ME1, you pretty much pick up everything you can like fallout3, you have no freedom on character advancement. It's all so linear and just an attempt to squeeze a few quid out of some existing code and a title which could have been much better. I can't give this a 0 because it loads and runs ok, but i'm not going over 2 because this game really does have no fun in it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

YOu meet some baddies. You press some buttons. It doesn't really matter which ones you press. Keep pressing them till the baddy is dead. There are other characters that you control, but they rarely do what you ask them, and often just stand in your way. So press some more buttons. Even on the PC this game REEKS of console. It has the depth of spit puddle and the gameplay you would exepct by a game developed to be played with the massive limitations of a joypad. I'm told that this is a great console game. I wish it would have stayed on the consoles, becasue it's a very VERY shallow PC game. OS developers! If I'd wanted to listen to hour after hour of spoken cutscenes - i'd a have rented a DVD not bought a game. "BANG BANG BANG MC Fly - Gameplay McFly" ..it's a GAME..The clue is in the genre game = gameplay not hours of listening to an annenoidal retard mumble through hours of text. I don't suppose we'll ever see a game like Baldurs Gate 2 again. Just shallow twitch games like this junk 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First things first it's no RPG, the quests are boring as hell, they're always the same, shoot some idiots with no brains and at last there's a boss. I've really tried to play it since I spent 5 euros on it some months ago, but everytime I've plaid for 20 minutes, I just quit, it's so boring. Worst 5 euros ever spent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The user score here surprised me so much I had to write a review.
First, it has the worst gameplay in the saga. Most RPG elements got removed, and it became a straight forward action game with pinch of other elements.
Second, the story is between horrible to non-existent. It starts with deus ex machina, continues with ruining the Shepherd character, and ends without making any sense or impact what so ever. From the saga over arching plot point of view, it spends minimal amount of time to foreshadowing events that in the end aren't even used or appear in the next title. Basically, a joke of a game.
If you're looking for a shooter action game, it could be a fun game, but don't expect anything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was an ok game but buggy as hell and on it's own not very memorable.
The thing that made this game 9/10 was user created mods.
Now that mods are monetized (thanks Bethesda) there is absolutely no reason for you to buy this game on PC.
Get your DRM free hard copy for console and enjoy this mediocre crapfest. 3/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thid game is between HOrriblivion and Morrowind.History and plot wise it is quite weak average, 5Gameplay wise its merely a port from 360 so it lacks a lot, 2Sound wise its good, 8Grafic wise its past mediocre, 6UI its total port useless to PC, 2Exploring, as usual, 10Character development bad, awesomely bas and anounced horrible since the start, but it s even worse, 1,Overall the game becaome shallow too fast, extremely repetitive, simplistic, 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best thing I can say about Skyrim is that it makes a decent action game; even then there's much better to be had. Simply put, Skyrim pulls the "RPG" out of "action/RPG."    RPGs are defined by the role-playing aspect that gives the genre its name. In a rather startling disconnect from previous Elder Scrolls installments and the Fallout series, very little about Skyrim actually fosters a sense of immersion and attachment. Sure, you play the role of a hero or thief or whatever you decide    Character creation, and its importance to most RPGs that feature this mechanic, is essentially written off as a minor hurdle in the beginning of the game; nothing about the process informs hardly anything save some inconsequential lines of dialogue. A given race has some minor initial bonuses in certain skills, but  nothing a half hour of playing doesn't disrupt. Classes and specializations are nonexistent and skills are threadbare in an effort to make the game more "accessible" but instead serves to simplify the game to an insulting extent. You can roleplay as a given "class" only by choosing not to use other skills available and adhering to a certain gameplay style; ironic that a so-called RPG forces this to be the case.    Combat is a bore; it basically revolves entirely around jumping to avoid attacks (or sometimes blocking, y'know, just to raise the skill to level up quicker) and pressing the attack button. Virtually no restrictions are in place in terms of gameplay: you can spend 30 hours playing as a warrior wielding greatswords then immediately begin your new life as a thief or mage with a little grinding (or if you're feeling lazy, exploitation of the level up system). This may appeal to some but those who enjoy depth of experience rather than breadth of content will probably be disappointed.    This emphasis on amount of content over quality of experience spills over into the core game as well. The main quest is always there (without any sense of urgency behind it, by the way) but most of your time will likely be spent slogging through inconsequential fetch quests and contract killings that you can pick up barely interacting with anything, or by following the slightly more interesting yet still lackluster guild questlines. These are where the majority of the game's depth comes in, however little it is. Two days out of jail you can be the master of every faction and have singlehandedly won the war that ravaged the land.    Two more aspects of RPGs Skryrim mostly abandoned, character and story development, are also one of its greatest offenses. I can count on one hand how many characters actually had a semblance of depth to them. Companion characters--more accurately called followers--do just that and not much else besides attack what you attack and haul your inventory. The importance of dialogue is negligible; you can learn everything about your active quest in the journal screen without having to hear the same recycled voice actors tell you. No choices with any narrative weight exist; the only choices I even noticed are ones that actually deprive you of achievements if you pick the wrong action (without  the game even hinting to you of the consequence) and force you to reload a save or even replay the game to obtain them.    Any fun there is to be had seems to be on the PC version if you install some cool mods, and even those can't fix what's already broken. With such a large world and so much to do in it, Skyrim tricks you into thinking it has scale where it counts, when in fact, it is nothing more than an expanse of content with the depth of a wheelchair ramp.    I wasn't immersed; I wasn't entertained; but, as a fan of the RPG, I certainly did feel more than a little cheated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Skyrim has two major strengths ; you can wander anywhere at almost any time and kill almost anything you find there and you have a huge number of sidequests available to you. Outside of that the game has a lot of flaws which everyone seems to be a little too willing to overlook. Character development is almost universally absent and plot never delves much deeper than prophecised hero slays ancient evil. Even the civil war arc which is intitally established as a major feature of the game's world remains largely stagnant, save for Imperial or Stormcloak troops replacing the local militia after certain quests.
The copy and paste enviroments aren't quite as bad as Oblivion but still enough that you can see some of the days where the developers weren't at their best. The biggest problem is the combat however. If you're going to play Skyrim, go with a mage, because melee combat, particularly if you use a two hand weapon, rarely amounts to more than mashing w/e key you've assigned your sword/mace/dagger etc to until the thing you were aiming at is dead.  If you are looking for a game that satisfies wanderlust and affords great flexibility, you'll enjoy Skyrim. If you're looking a tight engaging story and well developed combat systems, look elsewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is for the starting out gamer, Who have come out of there camp hole and decided "i will expand my horizon". They get told play skyrim, And believe wow nothing is like this at all.Then the usual players of such games as Morrowind and Oblivion and fallout 3, Come out of the anticipation hole and are in dying need to love this game, And say they do.Well don't it repetitive, boring and dam right rubbish. I did not feel my character got better or did i feel he had gained 16 levels. Felt like some kind of unfinished game. As for the bugs well, I won't go into that.I felt it was not for me, If you love it keep loving, But in reality against other games of its genre and even alot older games. It's terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot believe the average critic rating for this is 96. It's just sad that such a flawed game can receive a score 4 points away from absolutely perfect. In some places, the graphics even look inferior to Oblivion (such as lack of properly rendered textures, so reflections of light on walls don't happen, animation is just as awful, objects don't reflect or shine anymore) I've been playing for almost 20 hours now and am amazed that supposedly reputable review sites would be so generous to a game that is ridden with bugs, glitches and design problems. Movement is SLOW. Very slow - get a horse and it's barely any faster - sure you can sprint but the horse runs out of stamina, and if it gets hit it runs away and sometimes disappears entirely (one of the many weird glitches). You can get companions to follow you around, but they walk at a snails pace and get in the way when you're in dungeons. Combat is exactly the same as Oblivion, just point at the enemy and spam the button. You'll have read about the awful UI. Yes, on the PC it really is that bad. Good luck scanning through a massive inventory - it was better on Oblivion, at least you could view your character. Yes, in this game you cannot even see your character when setting up equipment and there's no way of sorting items. The graphics really do look like something from 4 years ago (and I have a decent rig, it's even rubbish on ultra). Textures are so poor they look like PS2 at points. The music is okay but nothing memorable. The quests are nothing more complex than standard WoW stuff (go here, talk to this guy, bring me that object). Recent RPGs have been pretty bad, so this is going to do well because it's something to play, but much I wanted to like this, it's a poor effort. I'm stunned that the reviewers have rated this so highly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really want to like this game I really do. But the UI on the PC is just horrendous. No modern PC game should ship with a 100% console UI and awful support for keyboard and mouse. All kinds of performance issues, I had a game stopping issue that took 4 days and a user fix to make the game playable.Once I was able to play the game, with an xbox controller mind you, It was a lot of fun. It is a very atmospheric game and is a whole lot of fun when you can play it. Getting to play it is the obstacle on the PC however.Here is to hoping the patch will fix these issues, if so I would have no issues giving this game a 8. But the UI has to be fixed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bethesda has done it again, folks. They released oblivion, again. This game will satisfy your yearning for endless wandering through a painfully unimaginative world with blocky characters, cups, goblets and plates. This is the exact same game as oblivion only Bethesda has somehow managed to make the graphics look even more hideous despite taking advantage of the latest technology. There are some neat effects here and there but the world is largely filled with dull, ugly textures and awful character models. It also seems that they have combed through their past games to make they replaced every interesting artistic idea with a generic fantasy clichÃ©. I have no idea why they did this. Morrowind had plenty of original and imaginative artistic designs. This dull world feels awkward and floaty, just like the last game. The worst part of it is that there is almost no new content. Looking through the character choices, skills, items, they are all taken from oblivion. I could forgive the boring fantasy clichÃ©s, floaty combat, ugly graphics.. etc if there was actually some substantially new content here. All of the laudatory reviews seem to ignore this glaringly obvious issue. If you were hoping for another expansion pack for Oblivion than this game might be worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am so disappointed after waiting so long for the next Elder Scrolls.  Morrowind and Oblivion are among my favorite games of all time, and when they were released were among the forefront of gaming as far as visuals, sound, and scale.  Skyrim falls short, and is clearly not "next gen" material.  The animations look so bad I want to quit.  The outdoor visuals are pretty good but the dungeons look exactly like Oblivion.  Facial animations are terrible, and the scripted events the first 10 minutes were so bad I didn't think I could make it through them.  Come on Bethesda!  Its been many years since the last Elder Scrolls, this one should be SO much better -- instead it looks like a highly modded Oblivion.  I watched a temple/dungeon just "appear" as I walked up to it -- that's 90's game crap.  I can't believe the people giving this game such good reviews.  And its SO clear that Bethesda put ZERO effort into the PC version:  its clearly for consoles to the point where a mouse and keyboard are very awkward (and they should be better than a controller/gamepad).  I've never bought into the conspiracy that game review websites get "paid" by big publishers/developers, but any site giving this more than a 7 is getting paid, sites giving it more than a 4 are drinking the Koolaid.  Bethesda, this has been a huge disappointment for a long-time fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is really broken on PC, it's unbelievable that reviewers do not take into account whether developers put in any effort on the version (PC) of the game that they are rating. Bethesda have sadly been extremely lazy on the PC side. I'm not talking about no added bells and whistles, I'm simply talking about basic PC functionality not working.- Numerous graphical issues- Alt-tab causing hangs/crashes (this isn't even hard to fix!)- No borderless windowed mode- No key bindings- Little/no support for non-xbox controllers- Mouse acceleration cannot be disabledUnfortunately this was a double day 1 purchase for myself and my wife so we could play through it this weekend, but it looks like this game is hardly playable in its current state (on our 2 PC's). A friend of ours woke up at silly o' clock to play it and ended up going back to sleep because of what a terrible state it is in. I wouldn't be complaining if this issue was limited to a single machine, but the fact is that this game is very broken on all the machines that ourselves and our friend have tried it on.If you haven't bought this game already, I would recommend not purchasing it until it is fixed.

This game is pretty good without mods. It still holds up as a solid 6/10. With the right mods, it's right up to a 9.8/10. Basically perfect. With paid mods, I'd give it a 4/10 just for the money grabbing on the part of Valve and Bethesda. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game reading all the positive reviews and playing dishonored(another Bethesda studios game). But after playing it i find it hugely overrated. There is nothing in this game. The graphics are slack, story pretty ordinary. All you'll do is roam from one city to another and fetch some souvenir. Certainly not worth the time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I dont know why people like this. It is so boring. The world is not to my liking but hey it is my personal point of view. I tried getting into it but everything after 30mins or so I will lose interest in the game. I know people say it is a perfect game but if I cant get into it, it means the game is boring as hell for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If your fun of a game is spoiled by glitches, do not get this game. I experience a bug/glitch ~every 5 minutes of playing, from crashing to killed NPCs falling through floors. The game is sometimes unplayable due to glitches and there are just so many of them. It is so close to being an amazing game! but it's ruined due to it feeling broken, rushed and unpolished. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry but Bethesda just stop. Quit now before you piss everyone off with the elder scrolls VI. The game crashes every few hours. The combat is left click to win. After obtaining 900 armor rating because of how over powered the perks are in LIGHT ARMOR absolutely nothing. And I do literally mean nothing could do damage to me before I out regened it with no bonus to health regen. The only time I ever dropped below 95% health was when I either took on 5+ targets at once. (This happens once every 100 fights because the game is too care bear even for a console game.) or when I jumped off a small cliff. Dragons were a joke; until you got dragonrend you couldn't touch them. Quest items had so much weight (one weighing 20!!!) and you cannot even remove them or store them away. Even after finishing the quest they stayed with you. Cooking and enchanting are horrible, cooking being the worst; they put no effort into it apart from "here's a set amount of food you can make you CANNOT make anything else, oh and your going to need salt for everything." The main quest line for the factions was so short and the â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is boring as 100 year old grandpa. The only positives it comes up with is graphics, fighting and music. Rest of it is sadly on low level.  Threw it away on the garbage after 5 hours of playing.  Wearisome story line and most of the side quests, option of fast travel  (why you need to buy a horse if you can use it ?), inflexible characters, bunch of tips for retards which kill game play and sadly lack of enemy NPC 's when you decide to travel normally. I think creators converged only on the size and beauty of the world they created, ignoring other aspects of the game. A very overrated production 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Starting off the game with a poorly scripted introduction, into a world of non-existent auto-save and useless magic. The graphics are meh, and the creators constantly blame the poor quality of the game on the fact that the game covers so many aspects. Well I have an idea for you developers, make a game that covers less aspects that isn't **** Getting killed and having to redo entire boss fights, and navigating through a console ripped inventory system that won't let you equip weapons properly. Not to mention the half mouse based and half keyboard based game menu and lack of in-game graphic settings sets the fate of a 50 dollar Farcry 2, and Fall Out 3: New Vegas texture bundle.I do not suggest buying this game unless your a fan boy peasant who likes whatever mainstream **** comes out because your friends think its cool. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only redeeming factor about this game is the soundtrack and countless mods. The developers released a broken product with countless bugs and errors; leaving it up to the community to finish the game for them. With that said, this game isn't my cup of tea. Sure the atmosphere is very inspiring, and the combat is enjoyable.

However the lore, story, characters, spells, UI, and just about nearly everything else is uninspiring and bland. There is really no incentive to continue playing after finishing the main story, the remaining portions of the game are generic in every way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is very good, but crashes too often 2 years after release. It's disgusting and disrespectful for people, don't pay for it, let them learn this mistake. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+ huge world
+ nice graphics

- random, one-dimensional quests with binary choice (take it/don't take it)
- forgettable NPCs - i remember only jarl of Whiterun (guess why), but no idea what was his name
- bugs, crashes, glitches
- aesthetics and functionality of UI (KB&M user PoV)
- "perk" trees
- gamebreaking items (+100 sneak)
- short and unispired storyline
- trashcanning ES lore simply to introduce the most generic creature ever - a dragon

I don't get sandboxes. I really don't. It's boring, grindy hack'n'slash. Burn it with fire. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is boring.  You spend 90% of your time running around the world (boring) and going through dark dungeons with maybe 15 easy creature fights (boring)..   Combat is shallow and uninspiring with no skill or challenge. An FPS gears of wars game requires more tactical combat techniques (duck+shoot, duck + blind shoot+ shooting from the hip+ aim shooting + when to roll and seek cover+ weapons that are actually used differently and tactically in different situations = all required to play the game)  This game, either swing a floaty sword or use range (all range is the same) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Out of date graphics back to 2005 level, no engaging plot, emotionless NPC, so boring gameplay. I tried this POS on my brother's PC for one night, so I am glad I got the fact that this is just a super hyped POS. But I really heard of the fun from mod. Sadly, I am totally not interested in mod. I feel this game is at most just a sandbox for players to add endless mods... roaming and enjoy in their creatures. How brainless... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Playing this game is a challenge, and not in the good sort of way. The challenge comes from trying to deal with all the bugs. Not small annoying bugs, but at times showstoppers that require you to use the console to continue game play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Le premier Batmou ne m'avait pas emballé outre-mesure et cette suite qui tente de copier avec maladresse la formule gagnante des meilleurs Assassin's Creed (AC2, ACB, ACR) m'a beaucoup déçu. Ce gros Batmou adepte de la gonflette stéroïdée occupe la moitié de l'écran sauf quand on le fait courir, ce qui occasionne un changement de caméra incessant dès qu'on ralentit alors qu'il suffisait d'avoir par défaut une vue plus éloignée comme dans un AC quoi qu'il arrive.

Beaucoup de combats, lesquels quand on regarde d'un peu plus près ne sont que successions bien orchestrées de mini-QTE déguisés (appuie sur Y quand tu vois le petit symbole, appuie sur X, appuie sur Y quand tu vois le petit symbole...) avec quelques ralentis lolilol. Quant à l'infiltration, elle a été réduite à la portion congrue. Pour combler le vide, le développeur a rempli son néant d'un tas d'énigmes pathétiques et de contre-la-montre entre deux cabines téléphoniques.

La maniabilité générale est également très en retrait d'un AC ou même d'un Infamous, la ville ne se prêtant pas à une exploration fluide de toit en toit, tout est bien trop hâché avec ce grappin trop rapide, le manque de points d'accroche et le gros Batmou tout mou et lent (qui a peur de l'eau de surcroît).

L'univers de la bande dessinée est cela dit bien respecté si l'on considère l'intrigue basse du front et les caricatures ridicules que sont l'ensemble des personnages impliqués dans cette farce à l'insu de leur ignorance pour adolescents américains forcément très limités. Tim Burton avait su en sortir autre chose en son temps mais malheureusement, Batman Arkham City c'est la BD à la lettre et rien d'autre.

D'un point de vue technique, le jeu excelle par contre : il est beau et fluide en toutes circonstances, les temps de chargements sont réduits et la VF est parfaite. Mais malgré tout cela, Batmou le mou du genou restera un tocard, lui et sa ville de branques. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Listen I'm a big gamer and I love a challenge, there's not a game I own that I don't crank it up to the highest difficulty, it was enjoyable until Y button and other associated buttons in conjunction made it annoying to play, I literally stopped playing it when the shield guys are introduced, I'm sure it may be fun for people on lower difficulties due to being able to get hit and still stand a chance, I'm a huge batman fan and the developers attempt to make this game difficult is just plain (fart noise)+thumbsdown. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot, understand how this game has been rated so high. It is clearly a step backward from Asylum for  variety of reasons. The storyline is poorly developed, at the game's onset you hear about Protocol 10, then promptly spend the next several hours doing nothing about it. When it all goes down, the end comes quickly and without much excitement. They cram as many villains as they can into the game, which I felt took away from the story. It felt forced, jumping from freeze to penguin to joker to Ras to twoface to mundy to Harly to ivy to clayface to the most annoying riddler to listen to in the history of the riddler. The City is maddening to go through. Did you play Spidermsn 2 with all of the swinging through New York? This was the exact same, except with a grappling hook. It was tedious, repetitive, choppy, and constantly interrupted by snipers, 'political prisoner assaults', phone calls from the Joker (which were sometimes entertaining), and so on. In my opinion, Batman was 'off' throughout the game. His actions, threats, demeanor, and total lack of emotion when two prominent characters die is maddening. He's stiff and inhuman. It's almost like they tried too hard to make Batman more tough and awesome...well, he's Batman and doesn't need the help. Playing  as Catwoman is overrated. It's mostly repitition of tasks to find a Riddler trophy, which adds time to the game, but it's meaningless time. Inmates talking about 'getting with Catwoman' gets old, and it's constant. Combat takes a step backward too. There are countless gadgets that serve little purpose, and numerous new enemy types that frustrate and un-fun combat. The game has an excellent soundtrack and I was very impressed by the graphical design of the City. For me though, the terrible story, choppy travel and combat, and different demeanor Batman make this a game to pass on. There are out-of-story challenges and an interesting 'new game plus' option, but I was so frustrated by the game on my first play through I think I'll pass and send this straight to eBay. If you are a fan of the TV show 'Lost', the Joker does have a great reference kind of bashing the show that got me to laugh out loud...unfortunately, that's really the best thing I can say about the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pathetic played this game for over 16 hours and this morning when i went to play the game my game save has been wiped this is a well known problem, total raged right now avoid this game for save reasons alone developers can go and suck one 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most overrated and overhyped game of the year. I give it a 2 just because of the shiny graphics and nice sound effects. The gameplay itself was boring and offered nothing more than other FPSs out there on the market. The SP was extremely linear and the storyline-crap (if there's any at all). MP consists of lots and lots of nade spam. Other than some customatisation options, it's a piece of crap too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ANONYMOUS. "Wow, what an overrated game. Okay, let's establish this first, as itself COD4 isn't that bad, but once you see the hype and fanboyism over this game, it is terrible. Where to begin... First of all, I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one to notice how bad this graphics are. They are stale and almost last-gen. Second, I thought that next-gen games were supposed to get past this respawning arcade shoot-em-up. I got to the point in the game where I stayed back and carefully picked out my enemies for about 30 min., working on clearing the area. Then I realized that they would never go away.When i realized the only way to advance was to sprint to different positions I lost all hope. Not to mention, for whatever reason... a lot of the time when i sprint I throw a grenade... even though im not hitting the left bumper. For some reason 1 out of 10 times when i try to sprint, when I'm done sprinting, i chuck a grenade for no reason. Okay, in some games (like MGS4), the respawning system is basically necessary, but in this game totally takes the fun out of FPS's. Thirdly, there are so many glitches, ie. weapons poking through walls, shooting through walls, etc. and unbalanced gameplay. Grenade fest break out regularly in the multiplayer, and for some reason, your opponents can chuck a grenade from impossibly far and just so happens to land right by your feet. More issues? No Campaign Co-Op, no multi-player achievements, no Rollover incentives, no character customization, part system sucks, no dedicated servers, host migration is lame, you spawn in the middle of firefights, can't see the part members on radar, and... THE STUPID INSTA-KILL KNIFE!!! Why is the knife so goddamn powerful! Ugh. Overall, this game is still sort of good, but once you see how overrated this game is, you have no generosity left. Please avoid this game."

a very linear storyline disguised by over the top dramatic sequences that is somewhat a copy of COD4.spec ops are mission that are derived from the story mostly. multiplayer has a very unbalanced weapons 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you can get this for free, a lot of fun can be fished out of Special Ops if you have a friend to play with you.  If not, good luck playing because that aspect of the game lacks a matchmaking feature.  The campaign is far too easy, with a generally boring plot with predictable twists.  The Multiplayer seems to attract a lot of people, but to anyone who has play CoD before, it's just very very familiar. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am seriously disappointed with this title. The ratings here are really misleading. For instance Killzone got a 91 average and is the far superior game. It beats MW2 in visuals, single player, weapons, online (32 players). The only good thing about MW2 is that they show replays of the kills. Pass on this if you are smart. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game really sucks, i did enjoy cod 4, but this is just the same but with much less actaull play time, my first play through was under 5 hours on the hardest difficulty, so if you like to get your moneys worth, this is not for you. GFx are ok, a slight improvement on cod 4, not not as good as some other games we have seen recently. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, I went ahead and bought it. I played it for about 2 hours (as to give it a fair review). Now I totally regret the purchase. I haven't played the single player but the multilayer is totally hosed. For starters, the no server browser is a big issue for me. I don't understand why developers are dumbing down the game experience. Everything is bubble wrapped so that tards can't get confused and screw stuff up. I don't want an expressline gaming experience. They might as well remove all video and keybinding options while they're at it. If these kids can't figure out how a server browser works, they are going to be up **** creek when it comes to changing resolution. So anyway... Now I have to wait for it to link me up with 12 random players only for #12 to dropout right before match start, making the 'searching for 1 more player' kick in. So after waiting for 4 to 5 minutes for it to get a group of people together for some macho machinegunning. I get in the game only to find out that it is easier to knife someone to death than shoot them. Okay, whatever, maybe it just takes getting used to. An hour passes, my hate for the game grows. Why you ask? Well, not only does the whole knifing thing annoy the ever living piss out of me, the matches only last a measly 5 minutes. That's right, just as you are getting into the flow of things, the match ends, only to kick you back to the lobby where more players leave the game and the 'waiting for more players' starts all over again. So, to sum up this over-hyped gaming experience; you join a lobby, wait 5 minutes for the game to start, play for 5 minutes, back to the lobby to wait another 5 minutes for another game to start. So, half the time is spent waiting in a lobby with a bunch of kids asking if anyone can hear them on mic. I have lost respect in InfinityWard. They have turned their shoulder to us PC gamers that made them. At least the new Medal of Honor looks promising. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wasn't going to buy this game, as I am more of a PC FPS guy, but my friends convinced me to drop 60 dollars to play with them on my PS3. Suffice to say, I am not overly impressed with the game and I think my first instinct to skip COD:MW2 was correct. The good: The game looks amazing. It truly is quite a graphics step up as compared to previous FPS's I've played. The perk system has been fleshed out and there is quite a bit of gun choice, as well as quite a few choices for outfitting those guns. The title and emblem system gives everyone the ability to create a callsign to their liking. The bad: If you like FPS's on PC, skip this game. If you like working as a team, even if you just met the group, skip this game, at least skip the console version(strangely enough that include PC now!). If you like a large gun selection that are usable, skip this game. The maps a nice, but there are not enough. The main problem with this game is they've taken increasing power of guns overtime to a level that I find unplayable. It's more like a paint ball game than what most FPS fans are used to. If you expect to have to aim, I wouldn't worry to much. In fact the game aims so much for you it becomes incredibly difficult to get head shots. The bottom line: If you expect a counter strike experience, or even MWF on PC experience, don't get MWF2. I would suggest checking out bad company 2, or sticking with the old standards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the gameindustry*s answer to blockbuster movies that turns out not as good as the hype tells you that it will. The gameplay (Campaign) is what you can expect from this type of game: average. This game makes the same mistakes as every other game. It becomes very repetetive and boring. I did not even complete the campaign. The storyline was so dull that i didn't even care how it ended. I have to say that the game looks beautiful, but that is the only positive thing i can say. The multiplayer is the same as before. Infinity Ward hoped that the multiplayer would be enough to save the game. They were wrong. The glitches and bugs from the previous game is here, and some new ones. For example: How can a Riotshield protect you againt a rocket launcher. That is just plain stupid. And they have added a Nuke. A god damn nuke!! Why would anyone want a nuke? The matchmaking system does sometimes work, but mostly it thinks that you are better then you are, and puts you up against people that have played for hundreds of hours more. That is all there is to say. The game sucks but looks good. Thank you IW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have a PS3 version. It has bad graphics (for 2009), and a very unbalanced multiplayer. As soon as I am in the game I am killed or...why it takes to quick to get shot? In Killzone I have an opportunity to start a shotting with other players, here I die from the first bullet - very frustrating. Another issue - it takes eternity to connect to other players. It would be great to choose a ranked match. All in all, too overhyped. Killzone was a true monster (in good sense) in comparison with this game. 1 Point for short single player 2 Point for trophies other aspects of the game are just horrible. I bough the first game to resell it after a month, now, I believed all the scores and bought the second to find out - it's even worse! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is massively overrated. It was way over-hyped to begin with, leaving me expecting something that would pull me in and beg me to play it. Instead, I was faced with a game that begged me to turn off the PS3 and play Gamecube instead. The game is filled with mindless shooting (I almost fell asleep while I was playing it. Seriously.), a cliche storyline, bland characters and a downright disappointing multiplayer system. They went overkill on attachments and perks in this one; I took a look at the attachments screen and my eyes exploded. Perks are now level-up-able, leaving you to unlock perks that you otherwise started with in the fourth one. Don't get me wrong. The fourth game was absolutely great. But this one... most disappointing sequel of the decade? I think so. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pathetic. Activision got greedy, they over-hyped the game to make a lot of $ on pre-orders and people who believe the obviously fake reviews. This game a shame on the great predecessor COD4, NO in-war feeling, NO long epic campaign mode, NO cod feelin` its just another class B FPS with well-known story elements (from other games) and cheap, very cheap attempts to rise the players adrenalin-level. The story is boring, and as the game can be finished in 3-3,5 hrs (!) do not except much from it. The worst is the favela-level, which is like a far cry2 joke, not to mention the part when captain price leads us: this part is shocking: its a pathetic, easier and very-very boring copy-paste of cod4`s famous Pripyat-level. Shame on both Activision and Infinity Ward. Activision and Infinity Ward achieved the unachievable: they managed to tear down the Modern Warfare franchise`s reputation to the ground level. For me COD4 is and stays the best FPS ever. This game is a clear example how greediness and stupidity can destroy a good franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had a lot of hype to live up to. Needless to say, it didn't live up to the hype. The single player stinks, and the online multiplayer is a carbon copy of CoD4 with different maps. If you are looking to spend 60$ for a game, wait until something innovative comes out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You better read this you monkeyMultiplayer is what everybody playes now.I was expecting a Great game with balance and teamwork.My First disapointment was you couldn't choose which map you wanna play, You can only choose with Mode you wanna play and this was for the PC, No mods, No Custom maps, No dedicated Servers, No updates at all.IW doesn't even listen to the players, they are just releasning Map packs for 15$.Noobtube is a Big thing now with commando and Danger Close which is just like the Sonic boom perk from CoD4.G18 is a Major Problem they need to fix and the Killstreaks are too easy to get, 7 kills for Harrier Strike which is just like air strike + Helicopter.I didn't Enjoyed the singleplayer at all, Lame reharsh story, Tries to be epic but fails.Speciel Ops is only fun with a Freind 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is an absolutely mess, but the worst of its crimes is it is just downright boring. Combat in particular is just a tedious slog, as the way both enemy and friendly attacks are rendered makes combat take forever, and the removal of character customization options that were incorporated and refined in previous installments makes combat repetitive. If you have played any other FF before, you have played this one, as it does absolutely nothing to introduce any new variation in regards to its core gameplay mechanic, save a weird system of abilities learned from equipment that is far too passive to alter the way combat plays out.

The story, while it starts strong, quickly degrades into absolute and convoluted mess. The game's supposed protagonist run around observing events but really doing nothing to change them while the plot becomes increasingly obtuse and contorted. It is a failure in storytelling on virtually every level. And this isn't even getting into the mess that is the final boss. This game will have you slogging through boring and uneventful random combats only to be fed a bizarre failure of a story piecemeal.

About the only good thing I can say about this game is the graphics or gorgeous. Well, the background graphics at any rate. The characters themselves looked like your dog swallowed a bunch of colorful ribbons and then vomited them on your couch, but the backgrounds really do look nice. Unfortunately, while pretty backgrounds might make for a good screensaver, they do not make for a good video game.

This game is nostalgia bait for those yearning for Final Fantasy to return to its Swords and Sorcery roots that fails to live up to the high standards of previous installments of the series. Save your time, money and sanity and avoid this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not a really good game to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a pile of old ideas from previous FF and nothing fresh, the story is so predictable and naive that reading old novels make you sleeping slower than playing this. The last masterpiece from Square was Xenogears. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is completely overrated. Its not bad game - we can find thousands of FPS which are not as good as this game. Unfortunately this is Bioshock franchise so we have to use special optics to measure this one.
If you are *Shock fan - preapare yourself for disappointment. There is no strategy, there is no hacking, there is no puzzles, you can carry only two weapons which are generally equal - pistol have almost the same power as machine gun so there is no need for tactics. Vending machines offers all necessary items in low prices - you don't have to think to much about money;)
I will write nothing about the graphics as its just simply ok. But climate .... Its just so f***ng sweet.... geeez. There is no moment when you feel like rat in a maze, there is no fear, no sense of danger. In rest of *Shock series you were alone in the world full of beasts - here you simply dont care. This is just another FPS- nothing new, with world set up in the skies. Ive been so bored that I could not stand one hour with this game - have to take it one hour day by day ;) I bought it for about 15$ in bargain bin - and i think its worth 10$ - just for acceptable graphics and Bioshock nice name on front cover ;)
Ant this game shows that "professional critics" are pay by game corporations - I could not find so called "review" with score about 60% - I do not believe that all of them liked Infinitie 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Combat overkill ruined the story and any fun in exploring the world. Watch a few youtube playthroughs and you'll get the gist of what I'm saying as you hear the let's players noticably sigh as they enter yet another area/shooting gallery filled with goons and realise that ALL of them must be killed. When it comes to gameplay mechanics, subtlety is not this game's forte.

Shame because the world and story seemed quite interesting.

Very over-hyped, overpraised and technically and mechanically lagging well behind many of today's AAA games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game as part of the Instant Game Collection available for free to Playstation Plus members.

Boring.  Painfully dull.  Takes forever to pick up speed and when it does, there's not much there.  I feel like this game has been done before, only better.  I don't understand this game's appeal or its universal critical acclaim.  Even for free, I can't endure another moment.  Sorry, I don't get it.  I'll give a couple of points because it looks great, but that's all that's there for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most overrated game of the year, with a ridiculous setting, a badly-narrated plot that made no sense at any point, and that left the player wondering what's happening throughout the game. And the game itself was just an average, straight forward shooter that wasn't even much fun. It was a bore to get through it, and I only endured it because I wanted to see what the ending was all about. Honestly, the game is not worth the time invested, and I don't know why all the critics are raving about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty pictures, no substance, which is what you can say about 99 percent of the games released these days.  And the game is over in 20 hours????  This thing should sell for $20 for such little content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Come on people for how long are we gonna take this crap, 60 bucks for 5 hours. The critics are also getting more unbelievable every day, and most of us get fooled by them.  The game industry with its greed, and lust for domination, is crumbling more and more everyday. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overhyped... way to repetitive and boring - the old Metal Gear Solid titles are way better than this.  Is mediocre at best - but not "GAME OF THE YEAR" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most overrated game of this year...surprised ? ^_^ 5 hours main story + 3 hours of coop for 60 $ ?The puzzles are creative, but still way too easy, GLADOS is annoying, i don't see how people can find her creepy. The voice acting is great, however. The graphics are incredibly outdated, in fact it reminds me of graphics in 2008. o_O Too many fanboys of Valve - too many perfect scores. Perhaps I will never understand what is so great about Valve's games, because to me, they are all recycable garbage on a VERY old engine. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game when it came out kept it for a week and traded it in for in store credit and  bought my kids a Wii game with the credit. This game had nothing worth talking about it was GTA in the Wild West. The multi-player piece was lack luster. It made absolutely no sense what so ever. I wasnt sure what i was supposed to do. People were just running around and killing other people for no other reason then they didnt even know what else to do. The single player game had no real direction, quests were everywhere and i do mean everywhere. The multi-player campaign relies to much on a gaming community that for the lack of better words just sucks. The game had real potential but it got lost in translation from concept to reality. At least in GTA you didn't need to stop for gas, i hate when games try to put an element of reality in the game by giving vehicles or in this case horses stamina. Really why cant i just ride my dang horse man why do i have to keep randomly hitting the button. Ok so i wanted to join the law, i see a fight break out i stop attempt to stop it the guy shoots at me i shoot back kill him and now the law is after me. OK OK wait wait wait... you say i can break up fights but when i do the law comes after me. Where was the law when these two were fighting ..? I give it a 2 for great concept im even willing to give them another try with RDR2 but and i do mean but it will only be a rental until you prove to me that this will work and for goodness sake put a higher rating on it to keep out the people that don't want to play the game as it was intended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is boring like assassins creed 1 & 2 all you do is run around and shoot/punch people and there isn't a good story to it. Thats  what makes it boring 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This really is an awful game, I wish I played a demo first. I was tricked because it looks good, and it's made by Rockstar. The graphics are the best part, the music is decent, the voice acting and storyline are both mediocre, and the actual game mechanics are terrible.Shooting your gun feels awkward, imprecise, clunky, it's not fun.Riding your horse is boring too, it's like driving a car in GTA except you press A every couple seconds, and the scenery as you ride is all cactus and grass.Herding cattle is probably the most boring thing in the game.Racing is all right, but not very satisfying.There's no choices in the game, you just watch as the awful story unfolds.There's brothels in every town, but you're married so nothing to see here folks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How can this be game of the year in so many peoples eyes. Its too similar to the first game.The first game was decent as it was original and I managed to get it for free.Overall this is just disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

cute sayings (6), nice logic tasks (8), relatively good graphics (7) constant load (2) a punishment for a fast thinker. Especially at the beginning where you basically run through, not even pressed every 2 min charging time enjoy the game into bottomless 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some people get Portal. I don't. I don't find it entertaining. It gets boring really fast. Perhaps it's the amazing start - too amazing to fit the rest of the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you played the original this is pretty much a complete waste of money. The new level simply is so poorly designed that it is very easy to get into a situation where in pratice the game cannot be completed and you have to start over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is this game good? I rented it for a week... after half an hour playing it, I cant be bothered with it at all. An extremely slow start... if it gets better after the start, that's great -- but I can't be bothered going through all the boring bits for that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game plays off the sucess of ooT,the controls blow and while the game play is so so, its feels like if just tried to hard to be better then ooT rather then just focusing on makeing a good game, it seems they took everything that made ooT famous and copyed it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game claims to have bad graphics but good gameplay, but really it does neither very well. This game is basically OOT with tacked on wii-wand control and Character design. Link looked badass in OOT, but in Twilight Princess he reminds me of an emotional 7th heaven character. Nintendo should really just do what they intended to do in the first place and remake OOT with updated graphics. Of course, the Wii is just the tiniest step up from the 64 anyways, and is not capable of rendering better images than the original Xbox. Somewhere in the last 7-10 years, Nintendo lost their way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game combines all of the worst elements of the 1980 zombie movies with the more irritating aspects of Uncharted. In terms of cinema, it is stunning (here the score not being zero.) In terms of game play, this is not a game for those not versed in run-and-gun tripe. The combat, even at easier levels totally gets in the way of the story line (what there is of it) and thereby discourages all but the most hard core combat fanatics.

All I can say is: "NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY DOG!"

I bought this on PSN and sure wish I had my money back so I could use it to search for something else as pleasurable as the Uncharted series. Those I enjoyed. This, however, marks my split from the Naugthy Dog family. They are going to have to do something unbelievable to ever get another dime out of me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got this game on Christmas and Played it for one night got stuck and never picked it back up until recently, and I regret it. THIS IS THE AMAZING SURVIVAL EXPERIENCE EVERYONE IS FAWNING OVER! It pisses me off even more that Metro Last Light came out this year and yet this piece of instant kill **** is the one that got all the attention. The game relies on the Instant killing clickers for Its difficulty, because those are the only enemy that you cant beat the **** out of. Your resources are always low not because you are constantly using them to fend of your enemies, they're limited because the world is so stupidly empty that you never had them to begin with. their is no tension about resource conservation when you NEVER GET THEM, human enemies almost never drop ammo, (which is just stupid, like I just manage to kill them when they had just used their last bullet) and guns just suck so why even use them, especially when you can LITERALLY BEAT ZOMBIES TO DEATH WITH YOUR BARE HANDS AND WIN. The game is a joke when clickers aren't around and then its only hard because they **** instant kill. Stealth is boring and has no tension because clickers are so damn easy to sneak by, (just move slow and hold still when the start to throw a hissy fit) and any other foe can just be beat to death. for a comparison lets look at Metro Last Light a far superior survival game that gets it right. supplies litter maps if you just know where to look, and the world is so detailed you'll always find new things you have to SCAVENGE and doing so is always rewarding encouraging you to do it more, while the last of us barley ever has **** anywhere, and if it is something it will always be something you don't need, like empty **** bottles. In Metro Last Light the threat comes from the enemies themselves, In the harder modes you can be quickly killed, but if your skilled enough you can avoid it, your not getting killed by a Animation is what I am saying. When you get into combat it requires the use of resources that will deplete the more YOU fail, the game gives you enough to thrive if you have the skill and if YOU **** up then YOU have to pay the price, not just get insta-killed and restart again or just punch the world to death. Metro Last Lights combat is fun, interesting, responsive, and satisfying while the last of Us has generic combat that's hard because its clunky, and I despise clunky controls because you end up fighting them more than the enemy. the stealth is where the last of us wins right? I disagree, while the stealth in Last Light is simplistic, that simplicity honestly makes it unique, whereas The Last Of Us has  stealth that is just like the stealth in pretty much every other stealth game made recently, I MEAN YOU EVEN HAVE DETECTIVE VISION COME ON! But aside from that its also just annoying, there is no satisfaction and it far too often breaks and I get seen through objects or when I shouldn't, Where in Last Light I only get spotted when I made a mistake or when I should encouraging me to try harder at it and look forward to a chance to prove my skill rather than dread the next stealth section. The best way to express my dislike for this game is the simple fact that the only time I had any fun is when nothing was happening and I was constantly dreading when the game would come back. that's not the sign of a good time. Also yes the characters and voice acting are good but Im too annoyed or bored to give a **** The game part of the game has to be bearable for the story to matter and this is honestly one of the worst third person shooter OR stealth games I've played in my life. The best description I could give of this game is if someone took dead space and uncharted taped them together and striped all the aspects that made those games good out only to have a bull come in and **** all over them to fill in the gaps. This game sucks, and I will NEVER understand why people praise this "game" like the patron saint. **** this game for wasting my day and **** everyone who would call it superior to Metro Last Light, or Dead Space 3 for that matter, It would be a blasphemy to say that Last Light compares to the Worst of the Dead Space games, let alone overshadow one of the best survival games made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was disappointing. The game had so much great talk on how mazing it was said to be but I just don't see it the gameplay was okay the graphics were decent and the characters were good I just don't see the game as so good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Je me suis assez emmerdé sur les Uncharted mais parfois c'était assez marrant... là c'est pareil mais on se fait chier au premier degré dans ce jeu scripté, aussi scripté que le Call of Duty annuel, le tout emballé vite fait mal fait dans une vague histoire suintant les bons sentiments avec une grande maladresse et qui multiplie de surcroît les poncifs à l'infini.

Certes c'est techniquement très beau, c'est magnifique même, mais la beauté ne suffit pas... Les mécaniques d'infiltration sont bancales et l'action est beaucoup moins convaincante que dans les Uncharted, lesquels n'étaient pas vraiment à citer en exemple dans leur domaine. On s'ennuie très vite dans ce couloir à zombis et aux personnages-tronches à baffes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was an average movie which a stereotypical Booker Dewitt hero and typical B grade cinema storyline that I've seen multiple times before, most of all there was nothing extraordinary about the gameplay. I think this team was embarrassed to make a video game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a PC Gamer with a PS3 I had heard of the Reviews of The Last of Us, But In reality the Controls are poor and the game attempted to make you feel emotions for the character but with me it simply didn't work and i just felt like it had a good idea with some good story but it wanted it to bad and failed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, wow nintendo, you're making me beat up kids now? And it has to be some kid that wears a mask because he's ugly or something? Nintendo are **** bullies or something. Anyway, this game's **** weird and creepy. I think I turned into a tree or something and I was supposed to fight the moon. Not only are Nintendo bullies, but they also trip on acid or something occasionally, like what the **** 2/10 not the moon I was wanting to see, where's the elf girl? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is exactly the same as the Zelda on Super Nintendo. Nothing changed. I am also disappointed that the only way to play Four Swords is if you have at least two players, which means: Another person with a GBA, the Zelda Game, and link cables. Very Upsetting! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just old and tired ideas. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is it just me that notices that people who give the game perfect scores have no reason? Answer - They've been brainwashed by Microsoft's advertising, waiting for the game, and preordering schnanegans. Meanwhile, those who didn't have a clock on their wall counting down the days to the release, see the game for what it really is. It's a weak, watered down version of the first game. The first game was linear, repetitive, and not that imaginative. There was so much more potential. The second game improves in some areas, but also makes others worse. Dual-weiliding is nice, but more tedious and ammo-wasting than anything else. The storyline stinks, and the multiplayer can't be played with anything less than 16 or so people - the maps are just too damn big. Vehicles are done much better in Unreal Tournament 2004. Halo 2 doesn't have the flair and solid performance of the first game. Hopefully, Halo 3 will be better, but I'm not holding my breath. It if is the first game for Xbox2 like people have been saying, I won't be paying my hard earned money for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After completing the game i found that this game is no diffrent from the first game. because there are no improvments over the original gamplay and the fact that that they are being lazy in stating that halo 2 is all about multiplayer this game deserves a big 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good game for Xbox, really bad game for anything else. I mean, come on, face it - Halo honestly isn't that good. Especially if compare it to the likes to Half Life and Unreal Tournament. It's the same tired repeating scenes, limited number of weapons and enemies, and only semi-decent multiplayer capacity. Microsoft has a reputation for bad games, and this one just continues it. A large number of reviews I've read say that Halo 2 doesn't live up to the hype it's been given - but they still give it top score? Bottom Line: There's WAAAY better games out there. Halo 2 is mediocre at best, but it will sell a gazillion copies, because most people who buy an Xbox in the first place are too dumb to care. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really don't see how this game got so overrated in the first place. Graphics aren't bad, but with a stupid, repetitive, and predictable story line it isn't even comparable to Half-life 2. Also, gameplay offers nothing new, everything is been there done that. MUultiplayer isn't bad, but with an online community filled with immature 12 year olds it isn't worth it, especially since you can get the same online experience buy getting HL2 and dling mods with the same multiplayer modes as Halo 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is highly overrated and no game reviewer wants to admit it. The graphics looked like a downgrade, the character acting was abysmal and the gameplay just sucked. If your a true fanboy of the series none of that would have affected you but as for me, I'll stick with Halo 1. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not giving this a 2 because the game is an utter disappointment but you are buying the same game with worse weapons, a confusing control system, familier game design (without any element of good game design), awful graphics and a storyline that has gone from biblical zeal to a story that has more to do with willy wonka. The multiplayer is an utter dissapointment compared to the original Halo as the maps are dreadful. If you want an online halo game, buy Halo (PC). It will even work on a dial-up modem! Halo 2 is just a hype that was actually the low point to xbox not to mind the series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Halo 2 is one of the best games of all time, so why did I give it a 2? To understand halo 2 you must become the 2. Without the 2 you won't get the 2 ya know? They call it Halo 2 because you get 2 guns on this one, one for each arm. Combat Evolved was a very poor spin off and ODST didnt live up the hype to be a true successor. Play this one only because its the only good one. Just remember you gotta be the 2 to get the 2 and if you aint the 2 you cant 2 the 2 ya 2? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Excellent graphics, but the game play sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, one of the most over rated games I have ever played. L.A Noire put this game to shame...
Part of the reason I didn't like it I am sure is because I just never really cared for the western theme. However, I thought maybe this game would do something different or unique. It didn't. On top of that, the atmosphere and story was the blandest I have ever played through. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is the most boring, DREADFUL, games i have ever ever played... graphically its sweet, sound is tight, i feel like i'm there... the horse riding, slow pace, they had me killing coyotes! in that moment i said i love john wayne, but i don't want to be him 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disgusted that I paid for this junk. I have Gun for the PS2 and r.d redemption is just a rip off of it. Following people to your next mission bores me to tears and what makes it worse is that you have to listen to a conversation that  dosent interest me at all. Graphics are very good, I'll give it that but of course they are...its on the PS3 for christs sake.......If you've never played Gun for the PS2 and you like keeping the X button pressed for long periods of time while you listen to someone rattling on about why they live in the wild west then be my guest. All you animal lovers out there will love this game as 80% of the time is spent staring at a horses arse jiggling up and down.....Money not well spent....... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How did Rockstar manage to make GTA-Goes-West so boring, even frustrating at times? Clunky controls, game breaking clipping errors and a terribly executed cover-system. The dialog and exposition are not entertaining, insightful or the least bit interesting. RDR is my most disappointing gaming experience in the last 15 years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I shouldn't haven't to force myself to play this game, which is what happened after I bought it.  Basically its GTA IV set in the old west.  Boooooring!  I gave it 6 hours, and I still could not get myself to play it anymore.  I heard it gets better the later on in the game.  But come on 6 hours into it and I have to wait longer for it to get better?    Why do I think its boring?  Takes forever to get anywhere on horse from location to location.  Missions aren't that appealing.  Its to similar to the GTA IV for me.  I expected something different. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game I found to be really disappointing, the actual game play is horrible, if you are into the whole make your own levels then this is cool but if you just want to sit down and play this game is pretty mediocre. You'd be better off buying Viva Pinata, now that's a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game drops from a 9/10 down to a 2/10 due to the killing of the user created contnet community by the developers over zealous moderation of user created contnet 

as it stands all the good levels in LBP have been deleted an blocked from being shared online again 

way to cut off the hand that feeds you 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Little credit can be ascribed to this title. Its appearance and overall tone is ugly. It is not for everyone at all, and is very childish and patronising even though it's not aimed specifically at children. They really couldn't have done worse in terms of graphical style, characters and context. While levels and gameplay elements can vary, the actual difference controls-wise is not noticeable. It is a VERY boring platformer and brings almost no new innovations to the classic genre. It may be co-operative but it isn't fun, has one of the cheesiest and worst soundtracks and overall it's neither challenging, satisfying nor fun to play. I don't see why critics are praising this game, other than its lousy attempt at making a 7th-gen platformer for the masses. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wooooow, this game isn't just bad, it's horrid. It looks like something a stupid 3 year old would play. This game is bad with a capital B! Graphics were awful and game play was trash. It's an attempt at a platformer and it failed. I mean, a sack kid as a main character? Really!? This game has no skill involved. It's stupid, lame and a waste of time! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1. it is a piece of dog shit
2. What is all the fuss about it is only a game where you can shoot people you can do that in any fps.
3 PS2 don't deserve this game hold on the console is shit as well maybe it should be on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh. I really am annoyed about this. I bought it with intentions of getting sucked into the game like money into a vacuum cleaner but it just didn't work. Time and time again I have come back to this game, spending hours playing it and trying to get into the story. I can see why people like this game so much- once you get past the shell of this game I'm sure there are emotional plot twists, epic fights and pants of +3 healing... but what a shell to crack. I mean, I keep playing this game, sitting down for several hours, failing at enjoying it then going off for a stab at Oblivion or Deus Ex instead. Don't get me wrong- I do try. I spent £20 on this game, after all. I have a horribly powerful urge to play this game every couple of months (much as I do with the Sims) but once it's loaded up, I look at its pixelated graphics and sheer... dullness and give in. I'm going to say LOOK OUT. If you don't mind spending a whole day or so getting into it I'm sure there's a fantastic game underneath. However, if you're anything like me you'd be better off with a game which pays off sooner. A game like Baldurs Gate is missing from my life but at the end of the day, it isn't meant to be. Great music, though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am unsure why this game gets so much acclaim.  This gate is the worst elements of a home brew table top game with a sadistic GM tossed into on massive punishing Video game.  Flaws I found with the game:

1) If you are continuing from Balder's Gate All your gear is taken and any acts taken there are irreverent in BG2.  I.E. Characters that where dead can be alive and living characters can be suddenly dead.

2) Dreaded Cut scenes that can whisk away party members without you being able to put up a fight, or place your party in disadvantageous positions at the start of a major combat.

3) The story becomes increasingly convoluted including some of the most annoying RPG video game tropes such as being captured without a fight multiple times, bosses escaping when defeated multiple times, Super mages at every turn, Constant reminders that you must hurry yet few things in any are time sensitive, random punishment from social guardians, death of the main character mean you lose even in a world that has resurrection, Character interaction quests and dialogs show up randomly if at all, and ambiguous alignment changes.  All of this serves to destroy any emersion in the game world.

4) Not being able to finish side and romance quests if you complete the main story line.

5) Weapon proficiency system that has so many categories that if selected wrong can discourage you from using some of the best weapons in the game.

6) A terrible story line that has material that was dated even from when this game was released back in the day.

If you are intent on playing this game save yourself some agony, go online and find a walk through or  strategy guide so you know what quests will lead you where so you can to everything you want in a way that won't drive you nuts.  Also installing some community mods helps with some of the issues, but all in all it is a mess of a game.

There are some mechanics changes that were good such as ammo stacking to 40 items a slot, and bags of holding, potion pouches, scroll cases, and other such items to keep your inventory clean.  But none of these make up for the punishing slog that is BG2.  Honestly save yourself some time and play something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hate it. It's SO overrated. All u do is run around and kill people. The developers just packed a lot of violence in this krap and shipped it out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Essentially an overrated and glitchy remake of System Shock 2. It has some pretty graphics, where they work, but it is very linear, has little atmosphere and feels clunky to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioshock is one of the most buggy games I ever played. Lots of problems to make it work properly, lots of crashes. Not even the patch works. You only have to go to the forums to see how many people complains about this game. Besides the constant crashes, yeah, I could play the game, and...well, the gun sounds are...quite poor... the graphics, they all look like cartoons... it's just all go and go and go...absolutely linear...ambientation? try stalker, this one is just gotham underwater, i've seen that city so many times...and the plasmids...you kidding me? "plasmids"? sounds like something sweet and soft you can eat in the cinema...and the guy just finds a neddle and uses it, yeah, very common... Sorry guys, didn't like it at all, it's just a very common shooter exchanging guns for "plasmids". Very, very common... My rating goes for the crashes! (still quite annoyed...) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

On PC, this game plays like what it is - a bad console port with none of the problems ironed out. Although the graphics are hardly ground breaking (think unreal 2004 with bad textures and fancy water effects), this game is a resource hog, and it still runs like crap on high end systems. The sound likes to glitch at random too, forcing me to restart the game. Although the story is decent, the gameplay is boring, repetitive, and frustrating. Enemies respawn out of nowhere in areas you have already cleared just seconds before. The non-plasmid weaponry is uninspired and ineffective, plus aiming is extremely hard thanks to a poor mouse look implementation. This is one game that is better left on console. I want my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved the atmosphere and the story, but the gameplay is EXTREMELY lacking.

Everything gameplay-wise is poorly designed, from the frantic looting to the poor puzzles and messy equipment window. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Atmosphere and graphics are ok. Sound is bad, guns sound like you're kicking a tin can. Physics is terrible, you stumble on a seemingly 200 punds chest or a heavy wheelchair, and it flies away 30 feet (50 if you hit it with a wrench). It is also one of the most inconvenient and primitive shooters, and addition of "bio weapons" does not help. You cannot zoom, you have no secondary fire modes, weapons are primitive (gun, shotgun, tommygun - how original is that?) Money and items make a weak attempt at an RPG-shooter but fail completely. You don't even have a normal inventory. Switchin bullet types is too micromanagerial. This game does not know what it is or wants to be. And mouselook is terrible. I played tons of shootes, I played Q3 and CS competitively, and I have never been so frustrated by such unnatural aiming etc. Overall - 5/10. But for making big fuss about it - 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Things started fantastic, the atmosphere, graphics, sound were greatthen things started to go wrongthe shooting mechanics are clunky, when you die you go to a deus ex machina chamber, it's too easy and frustrating at the same time!Thank god steam does refunds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

one of the worst fps i have ever played, everything is scripted, the ai sucks, the story sucks, the art is avrage/corny everything takes along time to load and gui is terrible. I want my $ back 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pros: The storyline was goodThe graphics and setting are goodCons:The combat is terrible.  The plasmids are supposed to be so cool, but they are really just magic spells with a different name.The level design is terrible.  It reminded me of Doom 3 -- it was all "run down a dark corridor, and shoot the thing that will inevitably jump out from every dark corner or doorway".Seriously, this game is boring enough that I uninstalled it after a couple of days trying to get into it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst games I've EVER played. It had terrible QA issues (randomly defaulting settings and un-mappable controls), awful sound design (I could never hear anyone speaking over the ambient RACKET, no matter how high and low I tuned their volumes, respectively), and horrible, HORRIBLE gameplay. Good writing and ambiance is useless when the actual shooting mechanic is wobblier than an octogenarian. The splicers were awkward to fight and endlessly repetetive, all the characters (with whom we were supposed to relate) look like plastic, and for a purported RPG, this game has almost no genuine customisation options; I've never seen a worse case of consollitis. The degree of cooing praise for this game makes me sick. The 2 points are for the well-executed ripping off of Fountainhead/AS, and for the hard work 2K's art department wasted on this atrocious shadow of System Shock 2's glory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First I couldn't get the game to run because I use a tool other than Windows task manager to view running processes. Then, after I got it running, it was very pretty; stunning, in both graphics and sound. Then I discovered the linear, comic book story aimed at 10 year olds, and kill-everything-that-moves FPS action. Then I quit playing. This is just the next step in FPS game AI and graphics evolution. Just because its better than some of the more repetitive, older FPS's out there, (any one of the DOOM games) doesn't make it great or even good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i would have give it 1 but it has some nice graphix but it still has some graphic errors and the engine is not that good 3 ( let's buy the unreal engine used by 9999999 games and do some improvment so we don't have to work so hard : )
story 0 it just doesn't make any sence 
sound 0 i got that stupid looping sound 
gameplay 3 (hacking is like ****, turrets in 1960 wtf, electric gel wtf, audio logs/pda that's not from doom 3 :/ ,only 2 enamies well only ok there are many splicers butthey are just the same, horror my ass it's not that scarry, above all a city under wather that has gone wrong and all the zombies ups splicers running and the one who is helping you turns bad now that's not from doom 3 NO : ).
So i don't get why in the world is rated so high?????????
I mean 96 WTF STALKER is 100 times better and it got 86 i think 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm still wondering how this game is the #1 on Steam...it was good, but it wasn't NEARLY as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be. Primary reasons: It's ludicrously short...the game and bosses are pathetically easy(yes, I played it on hard with the BioRevTanks turned off...and I beat it in six hours), and (***SPOILER***) the final boss is perhaps even the easiest among them all. The different forms of enemies are extremely limited and universally easy to overcome. All that's necessary to beat this game is a handful of choice plasmids, a wrench and a shotgun. I do have to say, the story was riveting. I did however, get tired of the insanely long dialogues over that pesky radio. So if you're a weekend warrior looking to brag that "Yeah, I beat BioShock!"...no one will be impressed. Borrow it from your friend, play it once, buy Mount&Blade and play a real RPG. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If only link looked like he does in Soul Calibur II... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe this......... they could have made this game look so awsome! i mean...........wtf is nintendo thinking!? It looks like they designed the game for 6 year old kids......... NINTENDO, you guys better get your act together or i forsee gamecube not making it to gamecube 2. Thank God i bought a Ps2 instead! I mean i was gonna get a GC (just for Zelda)...... i'm glad i didn't! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

*Sigh* How the hell do i start...? Oh, yes! RE4 is the worst piece of survival horror crap ever! Seriously, critics! Were you high when playing this game? 96 point average?! What the hell?! The game is so flawed i could use it as toilet paper! Why is the game so terrible? Well, to start, the QTEs. They give you no time to react and brutally punishes you for wanting to enjoy a cutscene! Seriously, Capcom! You could at least warn us! At least you had the sense to either make us start QTEs of our own accord (like in boss fights) or you have time to react in RE6. Plus, I thought RE6 was an amazing game! Oh, and let's not forget 'Leon. Leon! LEOOOOOOON!!!!' I hate Ashley's guts. SCREW THIS AWFUL GAME! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overrated, boring game that fully discrases the name of resident evil. Capcom took there fans and took a complete dookie on there face and smeared it around! This is a terrible game. Its not even an RE GAME! WOW! Its got Leon And Ada... Woopty doo, its still not worthy of bearing the name Resident Evil 4. Resident Evil 4 should of been something completely different. This is stupid. Buy Resident Evil Outbreak, Resident Evil Code veronica, or Resident evil Operation Raccoon City INstead!

To clarify, I do not actually thing Skyrim is a 0/10 game. I enjoyed it a lot, but i believe it in no way deserves high score it got, especially compared to other games on the top list, and that is why i'm giving it such a low score.The game is actually pretty enjoyable.Everything good that can be said about the game was already said, so i'm going to concentrate on the bad things.First, the game is repetitive. It was accused of being a 'single player MMO' and i agree with this judgement. There is a bajilion identical dungeons (90% of them consisting of one main tunnel, 1 or 2 dead ends and a 'secret passage' leading back to the entrance, that can be opened only after completing he dundeon. The last one is in every single cave in the game. Every. Single. solitary. One.) and most of the quests consist of "go there, kill everything, get back, so i can tap you on the shoulder". You will also see the same tower/altar/building with a broken roof/campfire reused and copy-pasted over and over again.Also, there are barely any memorable characters. Again, just like dungeons and buildings, most of the npc lines are reused for every blacksmith/mage/whatever. Even when you meet one interesting, kind-of-dickish merchant, and you thing "hey, i like this guy", you'll later travel to the other city, and find out dark ef living there has the same voice, and is telling the same lines. Cheap.Story...is very basic. And very boring. And doesn't affect the world around you in any way, other than comments from the guards. You can save the entire world, and then go to some lord or somebody, that you -just personally saved or helped- and he'll never recognize you, and then send you to give a letter to his assistant. Who then rewards you with a "Good upgrade to your equipment", obviously not seeing your full dragonbone plate, that every city guard talks about.If you are not slaughtering people for fun, there's no way to affect the world around you in any way. You are being told you did something, but you never see what it changed. Unlike, for example, bioware RPG's, where you can actually experience how yor actions affect other people's lives, here...Well, you just kill the most powerful man in Skyrim, yet all his people are still running around, war camps are still set, and every quest given to you by his followers is still active. There's of course a lot of good stuff to the game, but -there's over 1000 good reviews here. They already praised every single dragonscale pixel of this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most people I know are talking about this game as if it is Heaven on a Disc,So I tried Skyrim just to see what all the hype is about,And I found it to be a complete mess, it was boring, overated, and had extremely annoying controls,I do not see any reason why someone should pay money for something like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The UI alone makes this game not fun to play.  Using gaming console interface cheapened up is bad, but add in the bugs and lack of consistent hot-key saving results in a recurring nightmare. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

why is it that people like this game so much. i've played trough it and in one word: repetive it's just the same lame thing after the other and when i ask friends why they like it so much they say: 'it's zelda man! Zelda!' Ok, sorry Zelda but i don't like your game, wan't a cookie now? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If I wanted a Gears of War, Choose Your Own Adventure book, I'd go to the library. I wouldn't preorder an action RPG. Everything they've done has completely ruined the whole reason I liked this series. Their waiting until release to make these details public just makes it all that much worse. This might as well have been produced by Activision and IW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Based on only playing (and loving) the first game, this one seemed like a slap in the face.  The premise being, that if you love a game, then surely the sequel will be made with you in mind, right?  Wrong.  These days it's all about catering to the haters, and throwing yourself after the lowest common denominator in pursuit of wider marketshare.  This is probably the most disappointed I've ever been with a game in my life, and from all indications I've seen ME3 is following down the same path.  We'll see. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry but I found the game to be very boring, the story was mediocre at best and I didn't have a fun time playing through this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great looking game and very fun to run around the city, but the game play is the most boring I have ever played. I play games on the hardest level and this game is just horribly slow. In the beginning fights it takes over 10 minutes to kill 10 goons. The harder level does not mean it should take forever to kill people. It should just be harder. This game is extremely slow and boring if you are on the harder levels. Other than the graphics this game wasn't worth the money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is soooo OVERRATED it´s not even funny, oh wait! it is! OK the game looks good, it looks better than anything I've ever played on any console, however this only applies to the environments; the character models are nothing to write home about, specially the enemies, they are generic and every enemy in a given area looks exactly the same. The combat is not as good as they make it sound, the only thing I really enjoyed was the story and the dialogue is pretty funny, but really, if I want witty and funny talking characters I´d just rent a movie and that would be a lot cheaper and it wouldn't take as long. In a related story, people who write comments in sites like this have the most horrible writing I´ve ever seen, guys! please, grab a book every once in a while so you can write proper reviews.

Since I played Uncharted 1 I couldnt quit thinking about how great its sequel would be if they fixed the controls and added multiplayer. To my surprise, I thought the sequel was much worse. All you do in single player is climb. This game is broken. I have gotten to two spots in this game where i knew where to climb but the he could not grab the ledge. Both times I spent about 3 hours and died over a 100 times because he would not recognize the ledge to grab. At another point i was supposed to put a dagger into a statue. Well the game never gave me the option to. The triangle button never came up when I was at the statue. I blew about three hours trying to figure out what to do. Finally, all the sudden a cut scene came on that never came on before and it allowed me to put the dagger in. Simply climbing in this game is a major chore. I tried my hardest to finish this game. But I cant beat a broken game. There is so little action in this game. And when you finally get to some, it to is very frustrating. Cut scenes and bad controls ruin the action. At one point I walked up to the boss and shot bullets directly into his head yet it didnt hurt him, and he killed me. But the next time a cut scene happened (why didnt the cut scene occur the first time) and we got into a fight and a simple punch killed him. The action in this game feels forced, manipulative, and buggy. As far as multiplayer goes, it isnt much better. I liked Gears 2 alot, so I couldnt wait for this game because I thought it would be a faster paced version of Gears 2 with the ability to respawn in multiplayer. But its frustrating and felt tacked on. The load times are long. The menus are confusing. And I cant figure out how to switch modes. How do you get into free for all deathmatch? How do you alter your character? Couldnt figure out how co-op worked. When trying to upgrade what does upgrade co-op guns mean? Does it not effect your gun in deathmatch? Overall, I thought Uncharted 2 is possibly the most frustrating game ive ever played. It could have been so good if they would have finished the game and fixed the controls, camera, melee, mulitiplayer, and gave it some of the nice touces of Gears 2 or the new COD, to show they actually care and werent trying to rush it out before the game was finished. If you want a better 3rd person shooter, its not even close, go with Gears 2 or the new Ratchet and clank game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why everyone loves Uncharted 2? Did Naughty Dog lobotomized you into thinking that it was great?
The only thing i see as a piece of storytelling is Indiana Jones without the intelligent and emotional script or the memorable characters and as a videogame a Prince of Persia and Gears of War mashup without originality and almost no innovation.
The first Uncharted was dumb fun, it had familiar but likable characters and a pretty good third act with scary monsters; however, in this sequel, the developers and writers thought they were making the next Mona Lisa and bragged about how their game had a better storyline than most other games in the market, and boy they were wrong. Almost nothing happens in this game, there are no stakes, there are no consequences, it's just bland.
PD: If you think that that bald guy was a good villain, you need to rethink your life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm shocked this game has received such acclaim. The graphics are nice and the story charming, but that's all. Gameplay is pathetically awful. Shoot, run out of ammo, & swing wrench. How this even got past playtesting is a mystery to me. Framerate begins to glitch and freeze when things get busy. Ammunition is stupidly scarce, requiring you to search every bit of garbage on the floor. Your primary weapons are zapping somebody with electricity and then clubbing them. You can't even access all the power menus from the standard game interface, these only unlock when you pick up an item. Skip this overhyped nonsense an d buy a real game like Halo 3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great graphics, good storyline, pretty good thriller. Nothing like I expected, no RPG element. Basic horror FPS. Would have been much better on PC, Xbox 360 isn't for FPS', I bought it for the RPG element it was advertised as having, and was disappointed to find that it was nothing like that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Did I play the same game as the rest of you? I was expecting this game to blow me away. It didn't do that at all. It's basically 'Condemned: Criminal Origins', with a little magic & minor graphical updates. I'm still in awe at all these reviews. Seriously, this game was not good. You get to kill the same creatures over and over, in the same enviornments. All this game is, 'hack this', 'hack that'.. Kill this... Lame. Avoid it, and fix these reviews. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was great at 1st but after an hour the game gets repetative e.g there are only so many enemy types and most of the time the games objectives are go there collect that. The gameplay isnt that good either and enemies dont react the way you think they should when they are shot. For an FPS it is quite a long game but that just means more time wasted because it has to be one of the most dissapointing endings i have ever seen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioshock is one of those games where the first couple of days you have it, u think its like the best game you've ever played.
You get a little deeper into the story and you realize its nothing more than a polished up game thats extremely overrated.
Game play is fun to begin with, but the sparkle fades away when you find yourself killing monsters the same way over and over again. Graphics are mind-bendingly stunning but the luster fades off after awhile. If you want long lasting fun get COD4,Gears,Halo 3, or the Orange Box. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found the combat of Bioshock (and Bioshock 2) just really uninteresting and boring.  I loved the atmosphere of this game and the story (when there were bits of it), but I could never find myself interested in it enough to finish the game.  Repetitive enemies and having to scrounge through every single piece of debris to get small amounts of ammo and clunky combat design makes is a real turn off.  Why did everyone love this game? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The good: Good graphics. Water looks great and the Unreal engine is really good.

The bad:

This game is drivel. It's a zombie shooter where enemies have no sense of self-preservation and require no skill to kill. They range from tedious to highly armoured which means if you don't have any ammo, expect to have to respawn over and over again to kill them. They also reappear, so if you've cleared a room. leave and re-enter, half the time new enemies come back.

The map is difficult to use. Why isn't my head the tip of the arrow on the map? As a result, navigation is confusing and almost impossible. The game's too complicated. Not content with one monetary system, they've introduced a second. Also, all of the different tonics, potions and lotions are just too much. I lose track of which category of power-ups are useful and which ones I don't care about. I keep getting mixed up between physical and combat tonics, and keep buying more slots for the wrong one. It's just really annoying.

It's just totally repetitive. I am SO BORED of playing the rubbish little pipeline game to hack robots, security cameras, etc. I'm SO BORED of killing the same zombies over and again, and hunting for objects. I'm just bored of the entire game.

The story is pointless and the main character just accepts everything unquestioningly (who is Atlas and why is my character doing what he says?). Apparently this'll all be explained in the end with a great twist, but I probably won't bother ever completing this game so won't see it. I'm SO bored of this game after playing it for 9 hours (and not enjoying it for that time, waiting until I have a glimmer of fun) that I think I'll just cheat my way through the rest of it. The part where I actually start liking this game doesn't appear to be happening any time soon, and apparently I'm 1/3 of the way through.

Ever heard that you need 3 things to make you feel good: Mastery, autonomy and purpose? This game gives you autonomy. I'm currently boring my way through having to collect 21 little potions. Pointless repetition combined with only half knowing where to go (for once the little arrow at the top has stopped giving me directions).

The story is TOO SLOW so I feel like there's NO PURPOSE. It's not mysterious it's just slow.

And I can keep on dying and respawning as much as I like which means that my choices have NO CONSEQUENCES and are completely meaningless. I can shoot Big Daddies from my respawn point (because if you run out of money and decent weapons you can barely kill them). The other enemies are basically zombies that run at you mindlessly. No tactics at all. So there's no need to master anything in this game. It's just a tedious walk through the levels.

I am completely baffled why this game has scored so highly. I'm only glad I bought it 5 years after its release instead of paying full price for it.

So in short if you like games like Batman where you enjoy having to outsmart your enemies (ones with a sense of self-preservation) and enjoy variety while making meaningful choices that have actual consequences, you probably won't enjoy this game. But for some reason 1,305 people rated it highly... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioshock has a lot of potential. Starting off with the good, the storyline is one of the best ever, and the audio tapes are a very nice touch. THE BAD. As promised, there are many ways of killing your enemies. Unfortunately, the game's difficulty is too easy. The developer told people that ammo would be scarce and it ISN'T. A brief search through the trash cans and tables of rapture will yield more than enough ammo. Also, the one-two punch introduced in the beginning of the game (shock+wrench) is useful throughout the entire game. Why use telekinesis on your enemies when you can just shock and whack them. Why use advanced tactics when you can just shock and whack your way to victory. Hacking? Its useful but too easy. Big daddys can be taken down by using a shotgun with electric bullets. Simple. Bioshock has many innovative features but it does not PROVIDE enough circumstances of which they can be utilized. Translation: Its too easy 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ladies and gentlemen please welcome the most overrated game of all time!
A simple Zelda game with a good world and physics but with a PS2 graphic!
The funny part is this game has the exacly same camera problems from Final Fantasy XV.
The camera is manual, the moviment is not relative and the objects between the camera and the character are allways solid. So you can't see link with a tree is in front of he. Every reviewer complain about this problem in FFXV and in Zelda "ow it's perfect".
Just a normal game nothing else. People pick a lot of hype and fanboysm to make other people thing that game is perfect. It's even can handle 30 FPS.
Also the story is so cliche and stupid. 'Hey link, you are the hero of the prophecy. Save the princess, save the world' 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why the low score? Several reasons. The first are completely hotfix-able if Nintendo wishes to resolve them.

The Yiga Clan Hideout. You will be forced to play stealthy or die to one-hit enemies. Okay, fine. Spend 20 minutes or so learning how to get to the final boss the first time. Then spend 5-10 minutes doing it again. And that is only if you were lucky enough to save once manually as I did. Why? Oh, yeah. Master Kohga has a tendency to despawn if he is hit at the right moment with an arrow. The Yiga Clan Hideout is ridiculous to begin with and we are forced to suffer this insult to injury. Forced stealth with one-hit capable enemies who somehow prevent Fairy or Zora revival is just ridiculous in-and-of itself. Add this mess with the boss to the mix and we have this intolerable circumstance.

Tip for Nintendo: Please fix the boss. And fix the entire encounter while you are at it please. It is beyond maddening.

Weapon durability is horrendous. Weapons rarely last a single fight. Yet somehow your armor is completely unbreakable. I guess we should just swing our armor at the enemies in the game. And if only we could craft weapons from the same materials our amazing unbreakable armor is made from to make weapons.

Tip for Nintendo: Increase weapon durability. Give us a durability status bar. And, give us more options for later weapons what are unbreakable made from the material of our armor which is apparently immune to breaking.

Your horse. Somehow in a land of magic and miracles, your horse must strictly obey the laws of in-game physics. You cannot summon your horse. If your horse is not in range when you whistle it will not come when called. Okay, so, get back to your horse or get to a stable and board and then take your horse. Fine. The annoyance? The annoyance comes with how often you must leave your horse behind. And then, either getting back to the poor beast becomes a chore or starting back, once again, from the nearest stable.

Tip for Nintendo: How about, you just whistle and the horse enters stage left; or behind? It would work just fine.

Dungeons? Trials. Okay 120 trials. 4 divine beast encounters. Sadly all lack the proper dungeon look and feel. I am fine with them. I just wish they had included a handful of solid dungeon content worthy of previous Zelda titles.

Tip for Nintendo: Please do not forget the dungeon content.

Music is atmospheric but overall lacking.

Tip for Nintendo: Bring back more sections with catchy Zelda-themed music.

Finally, the story. Yes, I know, it is Zelda. The excuse is harder to make in 2017 than it would have been in 2002 or 1995 or even 1985. The story is okay. Not bad. Not great. Just okay. This last one has no easy fix so I will simply accept that this is Zelda and that Nintendo is stuck on that front.

Tip for Nintendo: While I am not expecting the Witcher 3 in terms of content or subject matter, try taking the Zelda approach for a more expansive story and not just an expansive game world.

In short, if they fix these issues I will reconsider. Until that point, too many bugs or just plain poorly chosen game design sections to recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Now There are some funny elements in this game, But this game is not that great anymore, It use to be really fun now people are ruining this game. There is so many times I gave up on this game because it is getting just irritating. Everybody is killing the hell out of you in this game because the controls keep failing at me, I try to kill the policemen but they made it so hard to use my gun that I had to just punch the moron but then I was SHOT!!!!! Can the police chases be optional? Can't there be an extra option for people that just want to hit cars and just enjoy that, rather than punishing all of us, I think this game is getting nearly broken. The Cops kill me more than ever now, Everybody is stronger than your character in this game it seems like, The Guns is what killed this game's potential, it kills people way too soon without giving anyone a chance, There are some modes and options missing, that is very disappointing, I guess I am not playing this game anymore, It use to be more awesome, Now the guns just take over along with the douche bag policemen in this game, It finally made me so mad this evening I am posting a bad review on it. I want this game fixed, Not only that, We didn't even get to the worst yet, the worst is what happened today that pissed me off, The game glitched like crazy on XBOX 360 and It made me so mad I nearly destroyed my XBOX today, thanks a  lot game, A douchebag police man was on a chase for someone else, I was at 0 stars, THE **** HIT ME AND DESTROYED MY PERFECT RIDE!!!!!! THEN I GOT UP TO 2 STARS WHEN IT WASN'T MY FAULT!!!!!!!!!!!! NOT KIDDING IT HAPPENED AND WHEN I GOT AWAY THEY DESTROY THE BACK GLASS AND KILLED ME!!!!!!! THAT WAS THE FINAL STRAW FOR ME, It made me so mad I wanted to break the disc into pieces, I probably Should've, Waste of time, Should've never gotten into this game, It's disgusting when there is no optional mode so games can be more enjoyable for others too that don't like that certain part of the game. That was a OUTRAGEOUS and STUPID glitch!!!!! To make sure that never happens again, I got so mad and I unplugged my XBOX 360 and flipped it over, I am probably going to delete this game off of it if I even use it again, The Company itself probably isn't going to do anything, It got 3,000 positives, That is fairly good for a game but too bad it glitched so poorly, A negative review for that, Maybe if that gets resolved somehow, or if I get in any contact with anyone over at Rockstar Games Inc, I might edit this review updating you guys and make my score higher, But if nothing happens like I am expecting, I am just going to forget this game despite the awesome graphics and the awesome action and explosions, There are some positives on the game that's why I didn't give it a 1 or a 0 like I was thinking at first I was so mad, No I am giving it a 2/10 for now, I just can't believe what happened, That was the most dumb and stupid glitch I have ever seen, I had a lot more fun in Crackdown 2, It is a lot fairer and you don't just die in like 5 **** shots, like you do in this game, that is too easily!!!! I know you re-spawn but still it seems like you got killed for nothing, It just really bothers me the way that was done, Crackdown 2 is more playable, you get killed less often than this game, This game fails when it comes to the guns and everything, characters are way too weak in this game, why can't there be a mode where your fully leveled up and you can really beat some ass like in Crackdown 2, Same Exact price as Crackdown 2 probably even more, and I personally had more fun with Crackdown 2, GTA-5 Is just repetitive after a while, you stay weak forever, you never gain health or armor, in Crackdown 2 for basically the same price maybe even less, more to offer you can even almost never die, you can keep kicking ass forever on that mode and not only that, little to no glitches, you can even have a mode where you can re-spawn like in GTA-5 so it is for you guys too, I recommend that game, Crackdown 2 is a pretty cool game, GTA-5 is just very lacking in certain Options, Not really that open for others that don't like that certain kind of style, It's really too bad, also it is easier to die now, they made your characters weaker NOT STRONGER WEAKER!!!!! While in Crackdown 2, Your character is STRONGER and you can even level up if you want and you can even be immortal if you want, While in GTA-5 There is no mode for that, Why? Shouldn't that be there? That kinda makes the game less fun in a way, I hate to give it a negative review but I feel like I should because this was very unnecessary, Worst Glitch I have ever Experienced, Just plain terrible, Never again for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SP is pretty good. There aren't many missions and they aren't dificult, but it's pretty good. It also has very good looking visuals. I would rate SP a solid 8/10.
MP is utter garbage. Unplayable, laging pice of sh*t. There aren't any dedicated servers, it's peer 2 peer. P2P!!! In fu*king 2015!!!! Also loading times - no comment. Online part of GTA V is complete failure 0/10
Overall 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a wasted opportunity.

First - The open world sandbox aspect is amazing. So much potential, tons of cool stuff to that. So many things you can do and interact with. Biggest positive of the game and it's a great one.

However, the plot goes to crap pretty quickly. They introduce a raging sociopath that everyone should have just shot in the back of the head in the first scene but, inexplicably, doesn't. They've got this unskippable torture scene, where you've got an interactive min-game torturing someone. Every other mission in the game can be skipped save that one, because... I dunno, some sort of faux moralizaing? It is also 100% pointless to the story. Does nothing, accomplishes nothing, nobody talks about it again, it's irrelevant save from trying to create 'shock' value. The whole SP campaign just gets worse from there. Not in terms of being 'too violent'. It's not about violence, just weak story revolving around everyone being total idiots and one guy being super insane unstoppable/unquestionable Mary Sue Kill Anyone While Being Indestructible nutbar *that you have to play*. It's like being forced to play some My Little Pony right in the middle of a GTA game. Jarring, out of place and stupid.

Online is broken. Full of hacks and cheaters. Only the most meager attempt to deal with it. Heists are alright if you've got friends to play it with regularly but everything else about online is pretty completely broken.

Crazy shoddy business practices. Games on Steam, right? So right before the Steam Summer Sale they jack the price up from $60 to $80, then say it's *on sale* for $60, throwing in a pretend money card (fake money you can only use online) to say it's a 'deal'. You can't buy the game otherwise. Oh, and if you did buy it? NON REFUNDABLE BECAUSE THEY GAVE YOU PRETEND MONEY.

Borked online, lying BS during steam summer sale and the most shallow SP experience of the series. Painful as it's set against the best open world environment Rockstar has ever done.

Get Skyrim and Payday 2 instead. Better open world in Skyrim and Payday 2 is 10x better for online heists.

Depressing showing by Rockstar. End of the day, it was a complete sellout, trading 'meaningless shock value' for rich characters and dishonest business practices for a good product worth the money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite a good and fun game, but I can't put a higher score because of the terrible support.

When customers buy a game, they buy a whole experience which can't be good when the game prevents them from playing further. When this happens, getting an automatic answer from the support 4 days later with only links to unrelated problems, and leaving users on their own trying to fix the problems in a forum is even a worse experience. Rockstar has been infamous for their pathetic (non-existent) support, unfortunately this confirms their will to pursue this path.

The game in itself is good, despite some obvious shortcomings.

There are a lot of activities besides the main campain, to keep people entertained. This is a sandbox that leaves the players relatively free of doing whatever they wish, but it's not always clear what they need to do in order to reactivate the main missions.

The main problem is most certainly the goldfish syndrome. For example, if you see a car, turn away and walk a few feet, then look back, the car is not there anymore. Or, if you purchase a bike and have it stored in your garage, it probably won't be there the next time you check. Whatever the state of the world is, it will be forgotten a few seconds later, and that makes most of the activities pointless (why make more money to buy stuff? You'll lose it anyway). It has been like that since their first instalment of GTA, and doesn't seem to improve a bit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game have a lot of possibilities to play but it's nevertheless boring. Now I have 60 GB more data storage and wasted 45 €. Maybe this is a game for 90% of the people but not for me. And there is no normal lobby for friends. You need luck to join the same lobby. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is awesome. The Player support sucks. They only will reply you with automatic messages, and you can't know and solve problems with them. If you have some problem with the game, i'm so sorry rockstar dons't care. Rockstar support is a mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Despite all these "polishing" and bunch of delays, all we got was a console ported version with no difference i  graphics, nor gameplay. Yet it confuses me that GTA V has again failed to make its users understand what the hell was their delays for. Lots of bugs and issues, somewhat good but not expected from a should-have-taken-weeks-with-delays game.Overall I am damn disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While it's still a good game (why it's not a flat zero) the sole reason I bought a second copy of the game on PC will now likely get you banned from the game. Single player modding. The moment Rockstar says they've fixed their system and single player mods are good to go without risk of bans (even if they still wont officially support them) and it turns out to be true I will happily re-rate the game much higher (8-9), that's how important modding is to me.

It doesn't seem to matter if you're playing single player or actually cheating online, many people are reporting bans for such simple things as entirely cosmetic mods. They seem to be using GTA:Online as an excuse to block all modding. It's really pathetic though that such a giant in the industry can't seem to limit their anti-cheating measures to only focus online when much smaller companies do it regularly.

This game has such massive potential for great user generated content but here we sit with it being crushed in favor of a notably lackluster online experience and Shark Cards (microtransactions for GTA:O in-game cash). Due to the number of people that bought the game it's modding community could even outshine Skyrim's once tools are created/released. They don't have to support single player modding, but the least they could do would be to not actively try to stop it. We all agree that online cheaters need to be dealt with, but they really need to leave single player to the players.

---------------------

The gun play is good, though the sounds are a tad stale sounding. Aiming is simple and fast, first person aiming is almost like a big name FPS. There are many guns to choose from and unlike GTA IV you can carry every last one all at once.

Driving feels nice and smooth. Weaving through traffic in your awesome sports car is fantastic. Speeds seem to be limited unfortunately so your in-game version of the Bugatti Veyron wont even break 200. Though that may be due to the fact that many PCs won't be able to render the world fast enough to keep up with the fastest cars at their real world counterpart's top speeds. First person driving is great but definitely needs seat adjustment options.

The AI can be incredibly dimwitted sometimes. I've had AI refuse to engage something trying to kill them, AI drivers consistently trying to drive into me as I go down the road, run into the open and get slaughtered when there is plenty of available cover, all sorts of things. Friendly AIs seem to have an aversion to shooting more than 2-3 shots in as many seconds when in vehicles, especially when they're on a turret gun.

The AI can have it's smart moments too. Hostile AIs seem to be smarter than friendly AIs. They'll suppress you, they'll use cover often, and they'll try to flank you when they can. They will also open up on you any time they can shoot.

Locking missiles are worthless against AI but nearly impossible to avoid for players. I've shot every last locking missile in my inventory at a slowly circling AI prop plane, I've shot numerous missiles at helicopters ad ground vehicles from aircraft. They almost always miss unless I get lucky. I've been shot at while in a far superior aircraft (a fighter jet) with guided missiles countless times by AIs as well as being shot at by players with locking missile launchers. They are relentless and EXTREMELY hard to dodge, this is coming from a guy who plays flight sims all the time. Where missiles fired at AI (even with full lock) seem to stop tracking when they get close enough to an AI missiles fired at you turn better, seem to be faster, and never give up trying to hit you. This is just flat unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. Missiles need to be uniform against all targets AI or Player.

The story is the same one you've probably played already on 360/PS3. Retired bank robber, crazy meth dealer, and laid back gangbanger team up for epic heisting action in strangereal LA. It's a fun story but desperately needed more actual heists and content. I feel like it suffered due to an obvious shift of focus to GTA:O. There is also plenty of content locked in GTA:O that needs to be added to the story mode including clothes, vehicles, and all sorts of other goodies. The latest content releases all seem to have favored GTA:O completely excluding single player as well. If Rockstar would patch all that content into single player as well it would be amazing. Another unfortunate thing is your GTA:O character who is in fact stored locally on your computer cannot be used as a heist crew member even though GTA:O now has it's own heists, you character interacts with many of the main characters including directly working for Trevor and Lester in "jobs", and takes place before the main story.

GTA:O is a lackluster disappointment to me. Boring grindfest or you're getting attacked by 9 year olds screaming obscenities on their mic or text chat. Jobs are fun but repetitive. No passive lobbies either. Everything is super expensive in stores. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

GTA V is loved by everybody. The reason is unknown for me... In my opinion it was repetitive, there were a lot of bugs, the story was awful and the graphics are meh... for me of course, because I think it's ugly to look at even on the PC version. The reason why I gave this garbage 2 points is the online mode. It's fun by the way :D 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is good. Sadly game fails miserably due game crashing bugs and all time favorite Social club launcher. You tube is filled with fixes on game bugs always same stuff "this worked for me might not work for you". Game is suitable for those who like to waste about 55-100 GB from hard disk and enjoy constant tinkering using youtube videos. So 2 points because game is actually decent sadly developers aren't done anything to fix game. This is PC version if you are not experienced any bugs, crashes or glitches you are one of the lucky ones.
Goes to same section as other game developers this Rockstar Games throw loads of **** to fan some might stick in it. Sad case of gaming industrys lack of morals. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Long empty rooms. Long empty landscapes. Easy tasks. Uninteresting story. Plastic heroes. Lack of narrative. Only  Oh! Doctor Freeman! Ah! Doctor Freeman! Wow! This is you Doctor Freeman?
Blah! Boring game. Cure for insomnia. I dont recommend this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overate and boring. Stupid game. Its like lets buy the valve rate team. So we can pwnd all other games. This game is bugged like shit unbalance and you can cheat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first Half Life was and remains one of my all time favorite games.  It's so great to me that it defies explanation.  The short of it is that Half Life 2 just tried to copy the first game, and it came across as a very cheap copy.  The only improvements are in things that don't matter.  Graphics and animations, guns, sounds, physics.  If you're not wowed by those things, and I'm not, Half Life 2 has very little to offer 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a SERIOUS GAMER. i cannot see what the big deal about this game is. you have TERRIBLE weapons with horrible graphics, yet people still call this one of the best games. the game is terribly unrealistic, and the weapons are just complete SH*T. The game is repetitive and has a boring... long story. i wouldn't reccommend this for serious gamers. but if you are a poser, child or beginner then by all means, start playing this game and start putting foward your one sided reveiws. This game was a hit in 2004 but COME ON.. all games have their day, and i think that the end for this game has come. Valves needs to focus on realising more content that appeals to the serious gamers. Half life 2, does NOT cater for us serious gamers! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** for its time and **** now... not an immersive story, first half of the game you do boring tasks and then when you start to shoot things and run away from that its still boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I first bought this game, Steam bit me.  It locked me out of the game after install, and Valve was so swamped with support complaints and fixes that I was forgotten for almost 2 weeks.   After finding out another recent purchase was "Steamed," I had to re-install Steam.  I figured I'd give it another go, as they're supposed to have worked the bugs out of Steam by now.   Nope.  Locked out again.  As I legally purchased the game via retail, I shouldn't have to ask, and await permission from Valve's support team to play the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game play is pretty good, graphics are what i would expect of a game this long in the making. but my biggest gripe is Steam. I hate this program with a passion. It tells me when I can and can't play my own games, it makes me sign in to play my games and if my internet connection is down then I cannot play anything at all! Whoever concocted this idea should be shot. Period. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring, stupid lineup, exactly the same game as Half-Life was, only better graphics, and so annoying Static envirement, stupid AI, ARGH. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most disgusting, sickening game I have ever played in my life. The gore is unessacary. No one needs to make or see what is in the game. People getting sawed in half... with their eyes bulging out of their head is not what makes a good game. Though the classic FPS and gun fighting is still there, this game is not for the faint of heart. I was 5 years old and could stand up to Half-Life 1. Here I am now, 13 and can barely look at the screen while playing this game. I regret ever purchasing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most overhyped game ever. Much worse than the original, instead of the varied aliens, you will mostly face human soldiers. Boring. On top of this, levels are counter-intuitive, easy to get lost and not find the way forward. Black Mesa in HL1 was an exciting place, compared to that, the levels are bland and uninteresting. Play the original instead, that is much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too much hype not enough content. Half life is so much better and its years older. so the graphics are better in halo but thats expected. cause its newer. just wait for halflife 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sucks Sicks. No fun, just like any other 1st person but with more crap. Not addictive. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Run in a straight line shooting the "tough" AI. Just a re-hash of Doom and not as good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so boring!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. I mean guns? Haven't we seen this before? Men with hands? Uh..Remeber Goldeneye? Things and objects...haven't we seen this with counterstrike? What I'm really trying to say here is I'm a big nerd. I want bots because my only friends are 3-D and have helmets...remember Counterstrike (again!) Enough with the same crap...how dare you have vehicles with wheels. New game? Easy, medium and hard levels? Laughable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't like the scanning in Prime, even though you didn't have to do it, I don't like the idea that in order to get 100% you have to scan every stupid thing in the game. The enemy AI was extremely **** They missed like crazy, and generally as long as you continued moving they won't hit you. And if they DO manage to hit you, oh well, they still have to hit you about 400 more times to kill you. The game was just way too easy. The controls were absurd compared to other FPS games of the time. The exploration wasn't real. They would set up a few little platforms and maybe a grappling point, and all you need to do is traverse the room. Terms like "exploration" and "puzzles" imply that you need to look around and figure out what to do for yourself. Instantly seeing what you need to do and simply carrying it out is not exploration. The game made me feel like a rat in a maze, rather than a person exploring an unknown land. I also hated the way they started you out with all this great equipment and then they take it away from you. It gives the player nothing to look forward to. You've already experienced items like the charge beam and morph ball, so obtaining them once again isn't really satisfying. It feels more like a job. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is no freedom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't see what all the fuss is about. Crappy controls, less than par graphics, no multiplayer, and a boring story. Anyone who says it wasn't 'made for multiplayer' is just making up an excuse as to why it doesn't have it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im sorry but i cant get over how bad the controls are, the car and gun controls are just sooo bad it makes the game unplayable for me.in fact ive sold it already, the controls have always been bad, dont they know this????
Also when driving there is a blur effect close up and this makes me feel sick, silly mistakes have ruined for me what may have been a good game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Long, in depth review:
You are likely to either find it very nice or heavily dislike it after a short while. The question is mainly if this is your first encounter with gta or if you already played the older games. In case its your first time, youll be amazed by the irony, the free world and all the rest - buy it. But if you know the older games theres pretty much no way you will enjoy the game for more than, say 30 hrs of gameplay. Singeplayer: The Characters are in some way cool but more like CSI guy cool - superficial, dumb, stilted. You wont ever care for them, especially for Franklin, hes plain boring and pointless. The story is okay in the beginning and than turns to extreme stupidity. I had more than one wtf and facepalm moment. The world in general is as said ok but not as good as the predecessors. What happend to car physics. You can now carry as many guns as you want, but as the guns are just upgrades you can throw away 20 of 30 guns (not literally). Most of the map is pointless nothing and the city offers less than ever. Side activities often lead to new hights of boredom. Like riding around in a slow submarine for hours or doing the easiest "quick" time events in yoga.
Now to the multiplayer: You dont ever say anythhing but thats no problem as theres no story. Everyone looks almost the same and everyone will drive the same (the fastest) car. The missions are 90% kill/retrieve with alway the same cutscenes for certain questgivers. I personally disliked races a lot due to the horrible physics, graphics and the lack of speed. Even the bugatti feels very slow whilst the average traffic drives with nearly walking pace. Tdm and the story missions used to be my favourite aspects of the gta4 multiplayer. As said theres no story this time and due to bad mechanics tdm cant get quite as good. But this tdm is massive garbage. New players come to a game with 25% maxhealth and a pistol. On the other hand more advanced players can buy radar for ingame money and usually have the strongest rifles with unlimited ammo and additional silencers. WHAT THE **** this is in no way excuseable. The game is designed just around the idea of the player buying all the nice stuff ingame. But this is only possible through either playing this **** game for hundreds of hours or buying ingame money with real money. A good example for this that in free roam - usually the main playground in gta - you constantly burn money trough dying, destroing cars and shooting your ammo. Or simple clothing like a black shirt n trousers outfit priced at 50k. A 500k sharkcard is 10$. So 1$ for this one ulgy, pointless outfit out of like 30. A maximum tuned out top car costs about 2 mil. - thats 50$ for the 3,5 mil sharkcard. But hey you got 1,5 mil for other stuff. Likely the next update will just bring a better car wich you should buy then. Now lets make thia point more obvious on the military vehicles. You just bought the only attack heli in the game the "buzzard" for 1,75 mill (bout 25$), but its okay cause now youre the king in town... but the last update brought the 2 mill savage heli wich is much better.  Now theres even a jet for 3 mil and an amored car for over 1 mil. So you DEFINATELY would have to buy atleast one 99$ 8mil shark card to get the full gaming content. RIDICULOUS pay to win right here. I wouldnt even play it agian if it were free to play. This used to be the best gaming series, now I appeal to everyone who made it this far to boycott R*s new politics and therefore this game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Odiei o jogo, comprei o jogo 5 vezes no ps3,pc e ps4 para tentar gostar e nunca gostei, quando comprei pela ulitma vez me veio um pensamento, oque faz esse jogo ser tao bom ? eu nao entendo.
ficar andando na cidade sem fazem nada, missões chatas, personagens chatos 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surprisingly mediocre, have you played any Zelda game? congrats you have played BoTW. Did you hate the item buying aspect from the link between world's 3ds game? Congrats have that in spares along with other annoyances that make the game a slog to go through. Outside of nostalgia this game has little to offer besides showing off the Switch's capabilities, might as well buy switch off for as much enjoyment as this game gives.  Only thing that saves this game is honestly the music as the graphics are a tad sub par for a new console. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An okay game, but suffers a few fatal flaws.

1. The frame-rate in towns drops to 10fps. It's bad enough to be distracting and nauseating.
2. The game is so long you'll be more than bored of it before you manage to finish.
3. A lot of the "content" they used to fill out the open world is low quality. Ie: pick up a rock to find a seed guy, DA NA NA NA! There are 900 seed guys. So sick of seed guys.
4. Abilities that used to be granted passively are now tied to equipment, so you must continually swap gear to navigate the world. For example, the Zora armor allows you to swim up waterfalls. Have fun navigating a clunky menu to locate the armor, equip it, swim the waterfall, then swap back to your normal armor at the top of the waterfall. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is really basic and underwhelming from what you would expect from 2017 game for 50 pounds.
Sure there are some nice features, some interesting spells as well, but that is not really a game changing aspects of it. Sure you we could ride a horses, and the horses are really nice made, but eh you guess it, other games also have nice made horses...
The world is huge, too bad its empty, and stuff renders really close to us, fog is also annoying and almost taking all the joy from the open world. There are also really few dungeons to play in, and almost all of them have the same bosses.
As that being said, there are really few enemies  you fight against, most of them are just recolors, the AI of the enemies is non existent, sometimes they could kill themselves when fighting on a hills...
The animations are really hard to describe, sometimes they are as smooth as a silk sheet on the other time are clunky as hell and characters teleport their limbs around, this feels really weird. The amount of fighting moves is not high either.
Graphics are the graphics you would expect from the free MMORPG game, not from high price stuff like this. Even though the graphics arent really exclusive, the game could have significant fps drops, sometimes even stutter when fighting many enemies at once, this is unacceptable for the price of the game as high as 50 pounds. Is this game in alpha stage? Because i cant tell, the game feels unfinished for me.
My score is 2, the game doesnt deserve more, simply because it is stuck in time somewhere between 2009 and 2010, for the price like this you would expect something much more. Why would you play underdog Wii u, when you could play something much more advanced for the same or similar price???
Both console and the game are not worth their price, i regret all pennies i spend on this, would have buy some league of legends skins instead... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward the next Zelda game, but after 15 hours i can't play anymore.
The game is a boring average of every open world game released in the past five years (Far Cry, MGSV, ASC)
I found no unique or especially fun features that would make me want to keep coming back, you have done everything in this game a hundred times before in other games and BOTW does not keep them exciting.
The combat is very repetitive you can use these gimmicky ways to dispatch random groups of enemies but there is really no point and it gets old very fast. The story is ok, for a game that wants to take zelda in a new direction though it was very similar to every other game in the series. There is a little meat in the dungeons but they alone won't take you very long. The English voice acting sounds off and out of place, but the Japanese dub is supposed to sound tolerable, the music overall is decent but goes for mostly atmospheric music, there are no new themes that get stuck in your head. Graphically the game is poor, i can't be amazed at the "beauty" of the world if the world is only being rendered for 10 metres, there were many times where the game would freeze for a second or two in intense combat situations and i am not really a fan of the cell shaded style, but i suppose Nintendo really had no choice working off a hideously under-powered system as ever.
So overall i would not recommend to Zelda fans, maybe to people who buy games just for open world but not me. after buying every other game in the Zelda series, i am upset that they have ruined  my favorite game series, this game had real potential but just isn't  fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game overrated, no story, bad graphics, clumsy gameplay, bad enemies, little history.

Same fkin game as the WiiU Version.... there's no difference either graphics nor gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

El zelda por lo que yo vi tiene un mapa muy grande pero esta muy vacío, como que le falta mas vida, mas animales, aves, más enemigos, esta todo demasiado separado y queda mucho espacio libre, no es estable tiene bajadas de fps, gráficamente no es la gran cosa. Dudo mucho que sea el mejor juego del año como dicen alguno y las notas que les ponen todas las review son exageradas, se nota que estan compradas, no podes ponerle semejante nota cuando el juego no se la merece, sólo porque se llama zelda le ponen esas notas y no le critican nada, si fuera otro juego le darían con todo. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This Legend of Zelda game is a great game if you have never played any other Zelda game before it. As a veteran Zelda player the game is very weak and is the most unZelda like game in the series, but we will get into that.

First lets start with what the game does very well.

1) Environment - It is beautiful and expansive. There is literally no where you cant go. You can climb up strait walls and across great valleys. There are no invisible walls (except map borders). There are secrets around almost every corner.

2)Combat - Beautiful flow between swings and dodges. Lock on works wonders. Bow and arrows are a tough but rewarding weapon to master.

3)Citizens - The people of the world are the most colorful of the series. They have so much to say and they bring the world to life. There are countless numbers of them. Its great.

From here on are the negatives. Most of which are Zelda title inconsistencies and annoyances.

1)The Master Sword and Hyrule Shield - They have to be found and earned, which is fine, but they BREAK?! Why does a sword and shield that has lasted a millennia, designed to strike down pure evil, and magical break?

2)Tunics - There is ONE. and its blue! and you can only get it after completing every single shrine. To little to late. The only other tunics you can get are amiibo collectibles. Which are basically in game cheats.

3)Ganon - why does it have to be some strange bull mist. Cant we have another original bad guy. So many other Zelda titles dont have Ganon at all.

4) Dungeons - There are NONE.....the things they call dungeons in this game are shrines. They are five minute challenges. You can figure out almost every one of them as soon as you come down the elevator. These are a cheap cop out to the notoriously difficult dungeons typically found in the series.

5)Sheikah Slate - apparently Link has a cell phone now. You have gps, camera, photo gallery, way points, apps, and firmware updates. This set of features should be stripped from the game entirely.

- The apps (i call them superpowers) are infinite. There is no magic bar to restrict over use. There is no logical reason as to why link has any of them. There is no backstory to the individual powers. The power to lift any size metal object with ease used to be confined to an object called the power bracelet. Which no longer exists. The ability to stop time feels forced. In any other title you would have unlocked such a power after ten plus hours. not one or less hours. Bombs used to grow in the ground. and Ice blocks are unnecessary. They all feel like they were late game development tack ons to make the player feel more powerful.
- The camera - This is another feature that is handed to you, not earned. Its mostly used for dinky side missions that require more than one photo from multiple angles to be able to complete it. It also has an enormous photo album. No more getting your photos processed, no more limited album sizes, no more upgrades, and once again no more backstory.
-GPS - the map is grand and expansive. Yet it is littered with way points and points of interest. Why cant we have just a town teleport and nothing else on the map. Instead everything is given to you and i feel no real challenge navigating the great supposedly wild terrain.
-Shiekah Shrine Indicator - easily the most annoying thing in the game. The thing constantly beeps in your face like crying navi. All there needs to be is a mute option for the thing. Instead when im shrine hunting i end up muting the whole game. Simply because a few shrines are on cliff sides and it will beep beep your mind away for the twenty minutes your climbing from cliff to cliff.

6) Enemies - Some are a good homage to the series, but others feel unnatural. Since when are there robot octopus turrets? or centaurs? and instead of making more bad looking baddies they just change the color to determine the difficulty. LAME. Even their outposts are the same skull in the ground from one side of the map to the other.

7)The Korok seeds - another example of a tacked on feature. You can often find them in obvious places, They are very simple to complete, and pose almost no real value to the game except the characters themselves.

8)Timeline - This game is probably on a new time stream all by itself. Making connections to several parallel Hyrules at once. Good luck trying to figure out where it goes.

9) Sheikah Tech - Has never existed before. It feels very alien with all the ugly glowing towers, bland environments, squiggly symbols, and steampunk armor. Its unnatural to the series.

10) Wild - I have never felt like i was trying to survive. Nor does the environment make you scream help im lost. So why have it in the title?

In the end this is a fun game to play. But its downfalls put it at the bottom of my list of favorite Zelda games. Which is unfortunate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

can be a good game, just cheats a lot against me in most missions. swears a lot and consists  of a lot of funny comments, just lets itself down with the cheating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously this game and it's online community is going downhill by patch by patch.Very buggy and bad driving physics. Rockstar removed great features that were present in Gta 4.The cops are op in this game.For example i killed someone no one saw me but as i was going to leave i got a one star level and decided to run.The cop Al might be fixed on next gen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very dumbed down car handling. It is pathetic and I bet that was made for all that casual players that dont know nothing about real world physics etc. So that kids can have fun in stupid games but when they grow up they are making car accidents because they have no idea about real car handling. Pathetic game because of what they did to car physics. And that funny ability to rock car back on wheels hahaha another feature for dumb kids. GTA is so childish that it hurts. I will not buy that game. I only hope that good moders will fix that pathetic childish car handling on PC version. Also add speedometer, fuel usage and stuff that will make this game more real so it will not look so much dumbed down.

In terms of weapons they made better work compared to GTA4 but they still are away from real counterparts. For example shotguns can be reloaded with one single shell WTF rockstar you imbeciles!

All this inconsistency and dumbing down is degraded my score like crazy even if there is lots of cool things in this game then it is obliterated by those imbecile designs that I mentioned above. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the Rockstar's masterpiece. The other games that came after are crap. They lost a great oportunity to make a great epic like San Andreas, but they ruined it.

The main campaign is too short because of the online game. They created a beautiful game, but forgot that it will run on old hardware.

I hope that Rockstar relaunch the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with improved graphics and the new shotter mechanics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Single player campaign is annoying and does not include enough heists. I hated having to switch players as the only character I truly cared about was Michael. The multiplayer really sucks. It lacks any proper menus to navigate through game types. You'd shouldn't have to play 10 hours of the same races or missions to unlock better content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To start with the good  the single player campaign is amazingly well written and varied. The characters are great, and you really get connected to them as you play. Online is also often a lot of fun (when it works.)

The bad: To buy all the properties in campaign you need something like 300 times the amount of money you'd accumulate during a normal game if you hadn't spent a dime on anything else.

The worst: Online is completely broken. Rockstar is trying to make an IAP-based online game so they continually reduce payouts for the majority of activities. On top of this, they also refuse to balance out the tank, which every cheater immediately bought, and which is the only weapon (outside of the sniper rifle) to have hitscan shells, on top of being able to literally outrun any RPG or grenade launcher round shot at it  even within a range for 30-50 feet!

Even worse: The matchmaking simply doesn't work, you will spend possibly as much time in an evening trying to get into a game and staring at loading screens over and over and over, then you will actually playing the game unless you play for many many hours at a stretch and never leave a lobby once you find one. Forget getting together with your friends entirely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game in its self isn't bad has some good story and  the characters are well made but it has poor driving and codes all and all its a game with potential but due to these massive flaws its just not worth getting  they also left out some good things they  put in other games like the hydra fighter jet  and replaced with with a normal less fun one that runs out of fuel can't say I'm impressed with it  the big thing being its to easy to die in a crash I hit a car in a low speed and it nearly killed me at full health  you spin out easy and its also hard to keep from bashing up the  car so bad the wheels lock making it impossible tyo get away from even a 2 star wanted level 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've playing GTA since GTA 3 was released in 2001. After Vice city and San Andreas i was satisfied. I don't care about graphics. I consider the most important part to a game is how addicting and fun it is. Plus this game is huge its overwhelming. I have  GTA's and i see no need for another. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At first this game might look like it's very amusing. But as soon as one finishes the storyline and most of the additional missions, it becomes boring at a pase much higher than other Grand Theft Auto games. It's just too overhyped.

Secondly, I'm having massive problems regarding Grand Theft Auto V: Online. First of all, there are still numerious people still unable to go online as they receive errors like "cloud servers unavailable" or "timed out locating session". Secondly, without forwarding ports and doing other crap you don't actually want to do, you'll be placed in an almost empty session with max. 4 players in the entire map. Thirdly, there are too many bugs in the online section regarding gameplay (getting kicked out of sessions, etc.).

In the end, this game is released too soon, is way overhyped and reviewers have proven to be once more subjective and typical sheep. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply put, this game is overrated. Especially for me, the kind of player who likes to get sidetracked with killing sprees. The limitations on who you can attack, where you can go, what happens when you don't follow orders during a mission, and how often police descend upon you is rather stifling. In this regard, I had a great deal more fun in GTAIV and RDR. As far as missions and story goes, everything is feels like a big string of loosely-connected events, with little sense of progression or narrative structure. I'm sure things will pick up later in the game, but until then I have little motivation to play errand boy. Not to mention the initial story arc of having to "get enough money to pay for the big bad boo boo we made" is ridiculously stupid (in my opinion).

Anyway, note that this is only a part of my dislike for this game. I don't feel I should bother to explain myself any further, considering the number of other reviews you can read, and my perception of the validity of this site (which is very, very low), but yeah...thoroughly disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lets start with the single player, the city of los santos is nice and big and fun to explore,but after 3 hours of game time you are done with the entire map there is just nothing more to do for you. And then the missions, it is just awful to play the exact same missions over and over again, you basically just spend 99% of your time driving to your target, then shooting someone (plus 50 other random dudes), then driving home again and watch a boring cut scene.
About the multiplayer ...you spend decades to get on to a server and the you get bugs, not loading textures and random server crashes  all in all not worth 50 bucks, no even 30 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great single player, but wait for the actual real release on PC and next gen consoles. No reason to give Rockstar your money twice for the same product. The online aspect was released separately because the developer knew it was broken. Have some respect for yourself as gamers and go against broken games and pay to win, when you expect more you get more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gta series never get the console progression.They should be stayed in 16 bits.Gta was a bad game but this V couldn't get out of its decay.Boring,overhyped,pathetic not interesting mental characters,greedy microtransactions.
I only giving this game 2 because the graphics but this game is not fun but as it's characters a pathetic way to waste time.Rockstar give us a favor and don't make another GTA again. Your mafia cliche bad jokes and tard attitude are already wasted.Let the ip die with dignity, would you? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to get a lot of hate for this....but this game is nothing innovative, creative, or memorable. It's simply muscle power.

Don't get me wrong, as of today, this is a very very good game.  Super fun and addicting.  Problem is, this is the definition of playing it safe.  Rockstar had a massive amount of cash to blow, endorsements, major backings, hype, and what did they do?  They gave us a half-decent story line, and a gigantic map to wreak havock.   Boom, millions of violence-obsessed morons shout "game of the year!"

In reality, games like this are going to, in the near future, become all to commonplace.  As memory's grow on consoles and games become larger and larger, budgets become bigger and bigger, it will be less costly than ever before to make a game with a bigass map and an okay storyline.

That's why I believe games like The Last of Us are so much more deserving of GOTY.  If you gave Rockstar a frickin PS50 and 500 million dollars, they would still struggle to make a game as hard-hitting, emotional, and applicable to reality as TLOU.

I must revise my original 10/10 review, sadly.  On October 1, 2013, Rockstart unveiled the online component of GTA5, and it is nothing more than a microtransaction rip-off scheme, just like so many other promising but ruined games of this era.  What may have been the best game ever made, reveals itself to be nothing more than a pay-to-not-be-terribly-inconvenienced scheme designed to frustrate the player into shortcutting a horrible and boring grind in favor of buying your way to in-game success.  The game gives you a choice: Boring, repetitive grind for in-game cash....or just buy your way to "fun" with your real money.  This explains the incredibly high prices of in-game stuff....and the difficult time you have earning money.  It is designed to be too boring to play without spending on microtransactions.  And why not, from a corporate perspective?  The customer pays once...then again and again!  Brilliant, if you're an accountant.  Terrible if you are a fan of full, complete, and immersive gaming experiences.  The single player campaign is fun though.  GTA 5 just has zero replay value now, unless microtransactions are removed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this game, but it was pretty bad, the story was interesting but the performance was just bad with continuous frame drops in the low 20s, boring sidequests, and most of all the flying in this game was just terrible and kinda ruined the whole experience for me. The game looks beautiful but but I really can't enjoy the beauty if the performance is this terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst 3D Mario game by far.  I love all the 3D mario games except for this one, and here's why.

Too Many Bosses - No one plays Mario games for the bosses, and this game has more bosses than any other.  They all kind of play like the Mario 64 bosses (King Bob-omb and Thwomp) where you have to figure out a trick to kill them.  Mario is about platforming, with maybe a boss or water level thrown in every now and then to mix it up.  This game feels like 25% bosses.  Boring!

Stupid Mini-Games - There are a lot of mini-games where there are a set number of enemies and you have to kill before the time runs out.  Or you have to destroy a bunch of boxes with fireballs before the time runs out.  Or ice skate around a small square and run into enemies.  These stars are just 100% boring filler.  Less fun than a Mario Party mini-game to be honest.  With these stars + the boss stars, the game drags.

Gimmicky power-ups - These are less bad than the above-mentioned things, but with everything else it just adds more tediousness.  For example, take the Drill power-up that lets you drill through planets to the other side.  It's kind of fun to use I guess, but it completely changes the gameplay from a Mario game to some kind of weird mini-game where you drill through stuff.  It makes several of the levels feel gimmicky, and with the bosses and mini-game stars it starts to make the game feel like it's all gimmicks and no Mario gameplay.  Some of the power-ups are fine, but generally I start to feel like I'm playing a Mario Party game with bad mini-games.

Using Yoshi's Tongue and Fireballs Does Not Feel Tactile And Good - When I have Yoshi I just want to jump around and press B to stick out his tongue in random directions and grab stuff.  Do I really need to point my wiimote at enemies to do it?  Imagine if in Mario World you couldn't jump around and press B randomly, but had to point a wiimote at each enemy you wanted to eat.  And there was no way to stick out your tongue otherwise.  It might improve your accuracy, but the tactile feel of just moving around and aiming your tongue is more fun and feels more responsive.  The fireballs are similar, I just want to press B, not shake the remote to use it.  Both of these "items" (Yoshi and Fireballs) are just two more gimmicky things that turn a level into a gimmicky mini-game.  Super Mario 3D world has showed us that this game would have been fiine if tapping B to aim fireballs (or even a yoshi tongue) in 3D works great and feels more Mario-ey and feels tactile.

Too Much Time Wasted In Animations - It takes 1-2 minutes after getting a star to get back into a level.  There's the animation of getting the star, going back to the ship, showing your star stats, walking to the switch to active the ship, going back to the map and moving your ship across it, selecting the star, then mario being shot onto the world to start the level.  It gets boring when I'm spending half my time watching this stuff.  Then when I get to a star and find out it's some dumb mini-game or gimmick I'm so frustrated.  I watched a speedrun of this game for a charity event recently (AGDQ) and there was more downtime for the announcer to read donation messages than any other game I've seen.  And it was a speedrun!   Usually speedruns have constant information and gameplay but there was so much downtime.  Also there will often be two or three times in a level where you waste 10-15 seconds talking to a little star guy, watch him turn into a star shooter portal thing, then jump and shake your remote, then watch mario shoot all the way to another planet.  Imagine if you were playing Mario for NES and 1/3rd of the way through every level the game just paused for 12 seconds to make a star portal.  It would drive you insane!

Too Easy -  Usually your reward for finally getting into a level is that you easily trot through it and get the star.  Nobody likes when a Mario game is too easy.  I remember people complained about Super Mario Bros. Wii for that (I think it was that one.)  We play games to challenge our minds, so when a game is too easy it just feels like a waste of time.  No other 3D mario game has this problem.

2D Levels Use Up More Space In This 3D Mario Game - Let me be clear, I like the 2D levels.  They're good.  But in a game with precious little 3D mario platforming that isn't gimmicky, the 2D levels just kind of use up space that could be used on 3D Mario levels.

In the end, this game feels like it was made by the Mario Party team and it's just a bunch of gimmicky levels that play like mini-games.  Between all the power-ups, bosses, yoshis, 2d levels, mini-games, and other gimmicks you rarely get to have some normal 3D mario gameplay.  I just want to run around as Mario and try to beat a level from start to finish without being turned into some non-mario object, or playing a stupid mini-game, or playing some other 2d mario game, or fighting King Bob-omb 9.0.  Ahhh!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Curse you SMG2 that I simply don't even this Game maybe because the first one wasn't that bad but the second is stupid Why! Why! Why is this game so popular!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is basically a waste of money in my opinion. I am truly saying this because I believe it is one of the most overrated games out there. I love how people always complain when games are copied and pasted, but except when Mario does it, it suddenly gets a free pass. I have played many Mario games, and the majority of the maps I can memorize from other games, and somehow no one notices it, and it makes me feel like the majority of Mario games are completely forgotten.

The game is way too easy, and I can say that many people want to play a game just for fun, and I can agree with that, but I do not prefer it in any way.

I hate this game on so many levels, and when Super Mario Galaxy 3 comes out, I'm not spending a pennies worth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I called the last one "original", this one... (sigh). I don't know if they intended this game to be EXACTLY the same as the first, than they got it right, but they completely screwed this one up. The plot is the same as the last one, the combat is the same as well and now repetitive, and everything in this game is EASY! I finished the game in under 5-hours easily without any help what-so-ever! This game was all copy n' paste! Mario is now a dead franchise and it should stay dead after this disaster! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Galaxy uses play mechanics from a 10 year old game and graphics from a 5 year old game, and doesn't even have a great storyline to salvage it from the depths of un-originality. It was nice, but won't be deserving of any Game of the Year awards, even if it wins them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring gameplay, abysmal story, , unnecessary prophecies and gimmicks, oh, and Mario fans are going to attack people that don't like the new Mario games? This game has it all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is getting boring now. Can't nintendo think of anything else or do they still have to rely on kids buying games with characters that have been used hundreds of times before. Once again Mario returns to yet another pointless and easy mission to save the princess who has been captured (again) just like he has for all the other hundreds of games. The only people who can find this game/series fun anymore are children (really really young children), people who just like walking on planets that take 10 steps to go around and catch a star while killing one enemy or brain dead people (which is actually a bit like the second one). If you want to waste your money on something repetitive then by all means get this but if you still like mario and really want to play it then play an older one (it is the same game basically). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe as a fan of the old 2D Mario, I am biased, but this game just seemed like a mess of poor controls, unresponsive camera, and mindless repetition. A couple of the boss fights were original, but mostly the game was frustrating. It seems to cater to kids, but would be way too hard for younger kids to beat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

O jogo é tedioso, o gamecube nao tem um jogo memorável do mario, fases chatas, musicas fracas, estilo de jogabilidade nada divertida, os graficos estao bons 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Freaking voice acting! The most fun levels are the bonus super mario galaxy-esque levels. Some of the levels in this game are really frustrating and the voice acting is awful! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not fun, I have to agree with all of the other negative reviews.  The gameplay is linear, like walking through a movie with only one possible course of action and either you're doing it or not.  Combat is okay, but repetitive.  I don't understand why people think this is what a "fun" game is.  I can play for about 15 minutes at a time and then I think "working on my resume would be more fun than this."  I struggle to understand how this game has a metascore of 92 and a user score of 8.7.  It's just Not Fun.  I created an account here just to let people know. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is broken.  Two bugs exist that can make it unplayable, and you can only use one save slot, so there is no "going back a bit" to re-do.  Other than these two unforgivable bugs, the game is great.  I cannot confirm, but think that they both exist in PS3 and PC versions also.  One of the bugs can be avoided, and I will help you avoid frustration by explaining how below with as few spoilers as possible.
(MINOR SPOILERS START NOW).  Wait until earthquakes, then read the rest and there will bot no spoilers.  (SPOILERS START HERE, unless you are were I have asked)  When you return to Botonacal Gardens going after Ivy, do not attempt to open any doors in the greenhouse that are covered with vinces.  Once through, the game saves you in a room that there is no way to exit.  Avoid this one and hope the other (pure chance/luck)  doesn't happen to you and it's a great game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The hype around this game is completely undeserved:

-The pace of the game is disturbingly slow, sometimes you're spending 4 minutes just to read 4 lines of text due to "tension building"
-The game numbs down "the real experience" by making non-combat approaches the best ones and the flash-player combat is about the only thing slightly redeemable in this game.
- The graphics seem to originate out of gamemaker, which would not be a problem at all if the gameplay was top notch, but it isn't, so it results in a bad game with bad graphics.
- The game is literally just a cesspit of memes, which is apparently something to admire nowadays...
- The $ - Hour comparison is WAY OFF, even if you played it twice or even three times to get the "good ending"

This game was just way overhyped by media like tumblr and such for its "quirkiness and level of alternativity" and it's supposed creative art style and the PC focus of combat being bad.

2/10 would not play again, would even go back in time to unplay it tbh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Completely overrated. This game tries too hard to be original and smart, but becomes neither in the end.

Cannot play it past 20 minutes - so very boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Over Hyped.

The humor feels incredibly low brow. It reminds me of the same kind of humor that is required to watch 'The Eric Andre Show'. So If you like phoned in, painfully drawn out punchlines, you may enjoy this game.

It has unique aspects in the game, but it's a fairly boring play style. The most interesting aspect is figuring out how to show mercy on your opponent, but it's not enough to make the play style enjoyable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The soundtrack in this game is AMAZING. Without it it'd be a sounding 0/10.

Having said that, the gameplay is more repetitive than your modern average shooter, all the jokes are flat (and based on breaking the fourth wall), each character might as well have been defined with a single word because that's the one and only trait they get.

Download the soundtrack, throw the rest of the game away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had a lengthy review here last night that's now deleted.  Two other negative reviews I had seen that were on this website are also gone.  Something weird is happening to written negative and mixed reviews for this title.

Not doing another lengthy writeup in case this is deleted again... so tl;dr

- uninspired graphics
- half-decent soundtrack
- dull gameplay that rips all of its ideas from Magnavox Odyssey titles
- Earthbound references for marketting purposes when the game has no similarity to Earthbound aside from a blatant attempt at ripping off some Giygas art and behaviors for the final battle in this game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where do i begin? the one player mode is long, boring and makes no sense, and to complete that with every character would be boring as hell. Multiplayer is crap unless you have someone to play it with. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're a child, or get beaten by children on real fighters (DOA, Soul Calibur, Tekken, Killer Instinct) then you will enjoy this button masher fest. If you always destroy your friends in real fighters, then play this one with them, they will actually have a chance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A large, diverse open world, lots of quests and absolutely stunning graphics. What's not to love? Well, I hate to say it, but the graphics in Witcher 3: Wild Hunt are merely a lipstick-on-a-pig distraction. What the graphics will ultimately fail to do is make you forget the fact that the combat mechanics are absolutely terrible. Much of the combat in-game is purely based on timing.

The average gamer is going to love how the game looks, but hate how it plays. RPG's live and die  by how well their combat system is received, and this game's combat system is an unintuitive, poorly-timed and oddly-keystroked mess.

See all those good reviews? I'm pretty sure they're all just too mesmerized by how good the graphics look. It's a shame the way you interface with them is such a turd. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm normally a big fan of this kind of games but I just didn't get used to Witcher 3. I tried it a couple times! I really want to like this game, but I can't! I get bored all the time and that's why I can't give it a good score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it is insanely tough which puts you in the mood of just not playing it is the first game to say "don't play me i am way to tough".This complete ruins the mood and how enjoyable it actually is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing bloodborne i tried witcher 3. Unfortunately it was boring as hell... the combat system is lame, and since you fight half of the game , i guess half of the game will be lame. I sold it after playing 3 hours through it. I don't say.. for a beginner gamer , this is gold. But for someone who played countless games , and games like gothic.. this feels a little bit repetitive. It has good graphics, good skill tree , good story but that's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Me, personally, I think TW3 should have been subtitled Silver Platter because everything is handed to you on said piece of dishware. This is a simple, unchallenging game that offers little in the way of meaningful role-play and does almost everything for you. What the game doesn’t do for you, it instructs you how to do in excruciating detail.

Role-playing traditionally makes the player contemplate and relies on intelligence more than the speed of your thumb on a gamepad. Therefore, don’t expect Baldur’s Gate 1 or 2 here. Hell, Witcher 3 is not even Dragon Age: Origins in the intellectual sense. Yet even so, Witcher 3 is not all bad. The game has its pluses (though not nearly so many as the thirty-five million dollar marketing budget and purchased awards would have you believe).  The expansion pack Blood and Wine is meh whereas Hearts of Stone rises above the rest. It is a gripping story with hard choices and harder battles and a relationship that is deftly, maturely handled. I am tempted to say Hearts of Stone is worth the purchase price of the entire game, but even its excellence doesn’t validate suffering through the mindlessness of TW 3, which is 80% fluff and takes control away from the gamer at crucial stages to display yet another stupid cut-scene. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game based on the good reviews. However, I found it to be very slow. To get anywhere you have to ride through huge landscapes. Too many cut scenes. Overall found it a bit boring.

Mechanics for fights were not great either. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to say that a next-gen game is 1080p and 60 fps. This game has a choppy 20-30 fps that makes it completely unplayable to anyone wanting next-gen gaming. Yes, huge open worlds and fine details are great, with the amazing story-line and the depth to choose your own fate are all on par to an astounding game... but at what cost? If the game is not running smoothly, if the game is not next-gen material, it doesn't deserve a good score. The game looks amazing if you're not moving and just admiring the scenery, but that's not how a game is played, and imo, it's unplayable at this frame rate and that's why it only has a 2. If you don't mind the frame rate and/or can't notice a difference then I'm sure any RPG fan would be in love with this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok so to start many have said controls (and camera) are horrible and messy. And this is true, sure the story is good but this is a video game not a movie. First and up-most the gameplay and combat should feel smooth. I have set the game on the hardest difficulty Death March and at first just hated the controls. It took a lot of patience and playing to finally get the handle of things. Once i got the handle of the controls the combat became too easy. The only difficulties are the witcher contracts and even the only times i had difficulty where the contracts with red skulls. I spent nearly 60 hrs into and only for the reason that i am a completionist. I will complete the game 100% through but if it werent for my complexity i would have dropped it much sooner. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot say this game was entertaining actually quite painful to play, ive seen better rpgs on a smartphone
I was expecting something different when it came to this game, no lie the story was interesting to a point but the gameplay itself could have been better the control scheme was meh the camera control was a little tedious and sadly i could not sense any emotion in the game itself. This game lacks what all rpgs require and thats emotion , the main character gerelt showed no emotion he was always in that lone wolf phase and never even made a wince when it came to confrontation.
I was rwalky hoping for something like i dont know lord of the rings or even baulders gate 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bought this game solely on all the great reviews it has received. I don't mind a RPG if it pushes the right buttons and this one did nothing for me. Fighting is extremely repetitive and boring. Way too much having to listen to people talk and their crap stories. Who cares about having to find a plant to make an oil to coat my blade to defeat a monster, I fell asleep ages ago. If your not balls deep in RPG`s id give this a big miss 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all I rarely write reviews but I had to warn others about this game, I was duped because of all of the great reviews but to me this game is unplayable, I really wanted to like the game but the controls are very clunky and unresponsive and this just kills the experience for me. Also the graphics are not really that impressive. So heed my warning and rent this one first, luckily I only wasted $25 on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Progress is a good thing - throwing random elements into a battle system and robbing it of any difficulty (aside from the annoyance you face when operating it) is not progress, it is laziness. SE, you can do far better than this, even if you have lost all of your real talent to MistWalker. I won't get into the story here, because others before me such as mdzN^^ and Jowy A. put it way better than I ever could. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you have never played an FF before, you will like this game. If you have, you will probably hate it. If you have played ALL the FFs, you might like this game just for the sake of change. Overall, bad story, you don't care about your characters. They are all near-clones of each other so there is no identity. Gameplay is decent but magic and summons are underpowered to the point of uselessness. It's like an offline MMORPG. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game was a pain to play, it was just so boring for a final fantasy which i expected to be fun. if a game is not fun then whats the point to playing? the main part of a game is that it should be fun. i felt nothing for the main characters and i never grew attached to them like i have to previous final fantasies like ff9 or ff7. there was no love story no chemistry nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The camera sucks and the battle system is stupid. I wish they would have made it more like FFX. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game = horrible! Vaan, can anyone say Tidus? Actually, the even lamer version of Tidus... WTF is up with the gambit system? I would rather play some stupid hack n slash where I mash a button, as opposed to running around doing nothing but watching animations on screen. I didn't get far enough into it to know where the story goes, nor do I really care. The gameplay is just so stupid and boring that I just can't immerse myself into the story. By the time I get to the next cut-scene, dialogue, etc, I am so bored that I am more worried about finding a save point (just in case I get bored enough to try and play this again) than pay any attention to what any of these people have to say. FF XIII, same thing, a button masher disguised as a 'fast-paced turn based system'. Square, rid yourself of that disease known as Enix, and please have some sense in creating the great games you were once known for! If you really want to change your battle system, take notes from the Shadow Hearts franchise. Those games had by far the best turn based mechanics, EVER! Not the dumbed down 'play the game for you' mechanics of this trash! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've read the reviews that claim this is amazing once you get inside, but I'm unconvinced and not inclined to bother. Very boring gameplay to begin; far, far, far too many beautiful but ultimately pointless and annoying cutscenes (skip 3 in a row, anyone?); and WTF? no option to invert the view controls. That for me is a deal breaker - it requires (I assume) virtually no effort on the part of developers, just a modicum of respect for the way my brain prefers to work. Can't rank it higher, no matter what others say. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Excellent graphics, and the grid system adds a level of customization to characters.  The world has very good looking and very varied looks.  FFXII does a lot of things better than any JRPG before, however it is very lacking in the most important area: Story.  The characters are uninteresting, unmotivated, and bizarrely uninvolved. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay is very boring. If you're playing the game right, how it wants you to, you're not doing anything but watching your characters. A huge dissappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was just terrible. Simple. There is no awesome nemesis, no interesting main character (ok, Vaan is the main character but he's just not memorable or has anything about him remotely... interesting), and no involving storyline. The rest of the final fantasy series has always been original, involving and epic, but this seemed to go for epic and ignore the rest. I must admit i gave up after about 14 hours of gameplay because it just wasn't fun. If by 14 hours your playing a game that just seems a chore, thats a pretty strong singla your wasting your time. It's got good graphics though, which is pretty much the only benefit. One more thing! You get all the characters so early, there just doesn't seem anything to work for. I don't get what Square Enix was doing making this, it was embarrasing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe now that the undeserving hype has died down, we can start seeing some realistic reviews on this crap game - I mean even the producer offered an apology for the nearly non-existent story, citing development time constraints! If a bunch of static, uninteresting characters standing around shouting their first, middle, and last names at each other repeatedly is your idea of "epic" writing, then FFXII is the game for you. If, however, you're not a Squeenix zombie and actually have a brain in your head, then stay far, far away from this RPG beta. Epic...right. A dead person could have written a better story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a Final Fantasy fanboy and maybe cause of that I didn't like this game at all...
The Combat system with the Gambit  makes the game too easy. you don't even play anymore you just enter the battle and watch the fight, boss after boss, after boss. Van and Penelo is annoying characters and Square enix should have goe with thier first idéa of never creating them and having Basch as a main character along with Balthier. instead of copy-pasting the both annoying immature chars that are only in the way and trying to make the game a little "funny" for kids.
The story is perfect. Love that I can finally come back to Ivalice and now I'm preparing for another war.
As I started the game I really thought and hoped for playing as Basch insteand I end up with some pre-puberty,  wannabe sky pirate called Vaan, who's somehow always saying wrong things at the wrong moments but still tryies to be that *I belive* hero. and sure it works but id doesen't fit in the script considering he is as I said earlier a copy-paste character.
So if you can outstand him. I'm glad that you don't have to play him. /Thank god for that) you will enjoy the enviorment, the story and the music. that's the 3 points I give for this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe for 2005 this game was acceptable, but frankly the PC controls are horrible. The objectives and action are so basic it's way too slow and boring. I made the mistake of playing Splinter Cell Blacklist first and I liked it much more than I thought, so what the heck, figured I would try Chaos.  I should have known there would be a major difference in playability and graphics. Not worth it in my opinion, even for just $9 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shock 2 ain't no Looking Glass game that's for sure.  Comparing it with the original is like calling mud chocolate mouse.  Clunky, silly, unscary, slow, predictable....and no cyberspace.  Thumbs down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Back when gaming was in its glory days, Valve released a title called 'Team Fortress', a game that won my heart and was incredibly fun in every aspect (it still is). In 2007, Valve released 'Team Fortress 2', which was enjoyable to a certain point. Several weapons that have been added, and several "class balance" aspects have made this game horribly unbalanced. It's more of an arcade-style shooter than Team Fortress Classic, and with that it finds flaws. Compared to Nuclear Dawn, where different classes have health but it remains balanced, Team Fortress 2 goes about it differently. Some classes compared to others, despite how enjoyable their concept may be, has about the strength of an infant by comparison, and are quickly gunned down. This game used to be decent, but valve has destroyed it over the years. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Finally played this game for the first time, and it was awful. The classes are way to restrictive, I would much prefer to build my own loadouts, rather than be stuck with something like shotgun, useless pistol, w/e melee. The graphics are way to cartoony, i feel like im playing a fps for 6 year olds who can handle the sight of blood. The weapons are completely unbalanced, i put 24 shots from a pistol into a pyro, he didnt die, and then he ran up and killed me with 1 second of fire to the face. Im not going to go into detail on the hats, they are just **** retarded... its an FPS not a fashion show.  i expect much more from valve, and this game didn't deliver. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing like the first, which isn't the problem. The problem is the simplicity in its skill base which simply shakes the hands with all the other FPS games coming to town these days. TFC was extremely skill and strategy based. TF2 is extremely number based. The only reason I give it a generous 2 is because of the comical cartoon characters, which is the only enjoyment I received from this title.

The art is unique, the FPS style of gaming in this second hit, is unfortunately not. A big disapointment from a true valve fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just blew $50 on "The Orange Box" to get this long-awaited sequel to one of my favorite games of all time, TFC.  However, after several days of playing, I can say without a doubt that this game is an enormous let-down.  We no longer have grenades for some reason, which makes sentry-guns godly in many cases, requiring a team member to kill himself just to destroy the sentry!  If you're in a good hiding spot sniping people, it is given away when you nail somebody because the camera zooms over to you, which ruins any good location.  The pyro has an incredibly weak flamethrower and it reaches about as far as his arm, making it useless for the most part.  Weapons don't seem to have a secondary fire anymore.  Oh yeah, and this may just be 90% of the servers out there, but every time I have joined and played a game, even if I play for hours, I have yet to come across a CTF map!  Everything has gone CP, which is boring as hell after a map or two.  On top of that, maps like "Well" don't even resemble what they have resembled since their introduction, which has spanned several game engines such as Quake, Half-Life, and Unreal.  This game is incomplete and does not deserve to bear the title "Team Fortress" in its current state, with the lacking of so much that has always been a part of TF.  Highly disappointing and if I could return the game and get my $50 back I would.  Bear in mind that I am an older player who is basing this review on years of playing ALL of the original TF mods across many game engines and am comparing it to what it used to be and noting what it lacks.

This game must be good. No, it must be a classic, it's developed by Valve! Well, I disagree. And no, it's not due to hats.

The problem I have with this game is funnily the classes itself. Picked a Spy and Pyro noticed you? Dead! Heavy noticed you, Medic is with him and you're a Sniper? Dead! Getting killed just because I didn't have a good class againts another player feels very stupid. In Section 8 for example you will have disadvanges, if your enemy has better loadout for specific style of combat but you still have quite large chance of killing the player. This game just gets the class thing wrong.

Another complaint is the map design. The default maps are usually about fighting in very small/thigh corridors, which feels very annoying when playing as Scout or Spy, which like open space where they can move freely. Community made maps on the other hand just scream for snipers or scream even louder for Pyro corners (My favourite class is Pyro btw).

The gameplay itself could be better, if it was faster too. Soldier and Sniper feel too effective due to how slow players' movement speeds are (Even with Scout) . Sure they are offensive based, but still a lot more annoying.

The game can be fun for people, who like extremely heavily focused teamplay. Otherwise it's better to just ignore this game. I for one don't fit to the teamplay focused group, even after thousands and thousands of hats. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great game till the achievement update came out. Its is  a Medic-fest now, and the way Valve does the updates basing them on 6 month releases Per class. It has ruined this game to almost to a point of mmo status. grinding to 1m heal points and getting 20 kills while healing a heavy. I am afraid of what the next batch will be IF it gets released before the game totally dies out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lots of content updates. Very little game fixing updates. Mostly cosmetic bandaids and pretty hats to fill up your inventory to keep you from forgetting your game will lock up, crash, and not get patched for 2 months. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

TF2 used to be something special, something that made it stand out from other games, however as timed passed Valve now ruined this game and made it a monstrous cash cow, not only that, but they keep doing stupid sh*t and ignore the stuff that needs addressing.

Firstly is F2P, sure it boosted the game's life span, but all it really did was add a huge amount of idiotic, immature and awful players into the game that poisoned the community, the community used to be friendly, they helped new players, we would laugh and smile while we enjoy TF2, now it's just "OMFG F2P NOOB!" "UR SH*T AND SO IS UR WHOEL FAMILY" and more terrible quotes that should stay in COD, players act aggressively for no reason and the amount of hackers has sky rocketed, thanks Valve, thanks for destroying a unique community with your sh*tty business model.

Secondly is how lazy the devs are now, TF2 got a lot of updates in 2011, in 2012 that dropped a bit, in 2013 and 2014 we get next to nothing except a million hats that nobody wanted and some underpowered/useless weapons, not only that but ALL UPDATES are nothing but cash cows, End of The Line was sliced and diced to death and only featuring hats, miscs AND A PAY 2 PLAY EVENT while we were promised new weapons, a new gamemode and map. The map was cut because "It's too confusing for new players" which is absolute bullsh*t because Valve has maps in the game which ARE EVEN HARDER THEN THE CUT MAP! You can still play the map on community servers, but it's still stupid that it isn't in the game, but yet harder maps are.
If you thought End of The Line was bad, the Robotic Boogaloo is worse, 54 "New" hats! Oh sorry I meant 54 RESKINS of hats! While some are creative, most are just carbon copies of the original hats.

Thirdly is the Source engine, it's an awful engine that needs TO DIE, hitboxes are terrible and the glitches make Ride To Hell look stable and well polished, crashes everywhere and game changing bugs like getting into spawns and more. As for the hitboxes, you can headshot someone BLOOD COMES FLYING OUT, and nothing.... while they shoot your toe and you instantly die....

Fourth is balance, the balance is everywhere in this game, let me tell you what I mean...

Scout is alright, however he does have some gimmicky bullsh*t weapons like the Sandman and Flying Guillotine combo, he also has some useless weapons like the Sun on a stick and Back Scatter.

Soldier is too good, a powerful and reliable arsenal of weapons makes him a top pick for tryhards, and all you see is them getting 50 points at the end of the match while 2nd place has like 20, Soldier is balanced, but when a pro uses him, there's no downsides.

F*CK PYRO, Degreaser is absolutely broken and is a straight upgrade to all of the flamethrowers, plus VALVE KEEP IGNORING THIS WEAPON AND NERF EVERYTHING ELSE! I love how Pyro can be a crit wh*re but Heavy can't drop sandvichs to heal himself and Engineer not having the Pomson penetrate targets, so those are OP while Pyro kills 8 of the 9 classes without any skill/thought? 11/10

Demoman used to be overpowered, but recently he's been reworked and I like it, he's still strong as hell though but better then he used to be.

Heavy is balanced in my eyes, too bad everyone wants to nerf his Minigun while Pyro gets away again.

Engineer is annoying, but not overpowered.

Same goes for Medic.

Sniper suffers from the same issues I have with nearly ALL sniper classes, "If you can aim, there's no downside or counter!" seriously, try and fight a sniper who can aim GOOD LUCK! There needs to be a longer delay when you can headshot people and not do BS quick scopes.

Spy is annoying, but the only issue is the Ambassador, it suffers from the same issue with the Sniper, but I think it needs a rework since it's a straight upgrade to all the Revolvers.

Plus Valve are slow as sh*t to nerf weapons, it took 3 years for them to fix the Mini Sentry from healing itself when being built, AND 6 YEARS TO OVERNERF THE AXTINGUISHER!

There are a truck load of more complaints, however there is one thing I like about this game and it's the characters.

All of them are well developed, fun and very memorable and they are easily the best part of the game, I love watching SFM videos of them, I love reading the comics, I love GMOD videos on them, honestly I love everything about them, too bad the game their in is ruined. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been playing this "game" for almost 4 years and i must agree with all negatives reviews. "Game" was fun only at beginning, before all those idiotic, retarded and unbalanced items arrived. On most servers classes or weapons limitations are hard to find. Same servers are mostly infested with spawncampers, laggers and last time even speedhackers. Now the "game" has become free, what means, there is alot of so called experts, lolling here and there without any reason, like mindless lemmings and trying to teach you, how to play... I have paid for this "game" and Valve didn't even bother to give any compensation... It's 2012, so buggy and outdated graphics, is nothing more than a bad joke, and technical support still didn't fix "hl2.exe stopped to work" error under Windows x64. If you looking for any good multiplayer FPS game, you need to pay, to play comfortable. Avoid this piece of junk and another free trash at any costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game was fun for a very long time and then the company brings out an item drop system that randomly drops while you play. Because the system was flawed and kept giving repeat items it made getting the items cumbersome and long. the company continued to promise trading of items and other things to help the "duplicate situation" but to this day has still done nothing. Due to this broken system some people decided to "Idle" to gain weapons without having to actively play the whole time and TF2's developers thought it would be a good idea to give everyone who never idled a "Halo" that signifies them as a "noncheater" thereby instantly calling all idlers cheaters. this has split the TF2 community in two and people get banned from servers simply because they wear or don't wear a halo (depending on the situation). Basically in one foul swoop the company has destroyed their game and killed their fun-loving community. If you haven't purchased this game yet, don't because you'll be walking into a mindfield of disappointment 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was originally hopefull of this game, but it's turned out to be quite a worthless game. I'm not gonna just spew "omg it sux"; here's why ithink it isn't a good game 1: The game has a very odd "balance". One class wins over the other no matter what you do. The solution would be to have teammates help you, but you can NOT control them. This mechanic works in RTS games, not in FPS. 2: The game offers very little refreshing gameplay. Granted, the characters can be funny. But seriously, what is new about any of the classes? Everything has been applied in other games before, and mostly better too. 3: step-in playing. As soon as you enter any server, you get bashed untill you give up. The only way to achieve and learn the game is to either have an awesome team (wich renders you obsolete) or to have an empty server, and neither of those are fun. 4: a LOT of custom maps/mods downloading. It really eats trough your broadband, and a lot of peopel havbe monthly limits. 5: The game is very cartoony, and the humour may be nice to see, but the actual gameplay doesn't actually fit in. With such toony violence, you'd expect a fun gameplay, well guess again. 6: The only real reason this game is still standing is because of the constant updates. People say the replayability is infinite, but what would you expect when valve keeps updating every month? The game keeps changing and thus if you don't play for a while you can start all over again. You never actually achieve anything. In the end, i'm not very surprised the fanboys have rated this game so high. I saw the game when it was just out, and it was kind of ok, but now that the regular servers have all gone and replaced by modded servers, it's hard to find a good game. And then when you join, you'll just get insta-fragged by a "sniper" with a crossbow that is only gotten after grindign to a certain lvl.... Ifi want WOW, i'll play wow. I want an FPS, and this is certainly not one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't mean to insult any Team Fortress 2 fans. I love that game. The reason i gave it a 2 though, is because it is now free-to-play. This I find to be an outrage. Until I get a refund my score will remain this way for eternity. I don't hate the game. I just hate that **** money was spent towards a game that eventually became free to play. What is $20 to much for some of you to bear? Well how about the people who did spend $20 to buy it? Valve is practically giving you money out of our hard-earned coin. So valve is stealing our money without the owners consent. Unbelievable. 2, you **** robbers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Looks like a cartoon and appeals to kids, but is awful to play, doesn't feel like a game, feels more like a beta for something better. Annoying two player partnerships mean newbies lose out very quickly. No fun, only have it as I got it free in the orange box. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Booting up TF2 I was excited to experience what many claim is greatness within this game. I was met with frustrating team mates and everyone else having special gear that made them overpowered. There was no greatness. Only a samurai sword that chopped me into a thousand pieces every match no matter what I tried to do.
The only things I enjoyed about TF2 were the selection of classes you could play and the different game modes available. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game and i was disappointed,the game is collecting dust,i enjoyed SFIV and i don't get it,why didn't they just release a dlc pack????????? I live in Croatia and the games around here are 100$ each! so i had to give another 100$ for the same gave i already bought! -.- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't understand why they had to make a whole new game for this. Surely they could just have done a simple software update and DLC for the extra ultras. This was just a way of flogging peoples money. Gameplay wise its slower than the original but everything else remains almost identical, so if anything they've made it worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA sports, ITS IN THE GAME, needs to be changed to EA sports, ITS STILL THE SAME!!! Ok, we have ower mode and playmaker(which was done last year by other games, but not quite as involved). Where is the online play that we have all been wanting?? Where is a new graphics engine?? Why does the computer make comebacks almost every game that are most impossible. Why can't we import draft classes from NCAA 2004? EA SPORTS SUCK!!! EA is trying to sell you a football game!! SEGA's ESPN is trying to make you part of one!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is no comparison to ESPN football. ESPN football gets you into the game, madden makes you look like your 10 miles away from the action. The players look like ants compared to the rest of the field. They also randomly pull off superhuman interceptions and catches. The control shceme could also be much better. Madden gets good reviews because its been around, fopefully that will change next year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Madden i have no clue why anyone would get this game, this is one of the worst football games out this year. Madden just is full of flaws, from gameplay to the announcers. The game you should get your hands on is ESPN NFL 2K4,this game rocks and rules, game play is great the whole game is great. 5 of my friends and I are having a tournament, we tried ESPN NFL, Fever 2004 and Madden 2004, there is no question to which one we picked, ESPN NFL is the one. We came up with these scores between us 6. ESPN NFL - 96 Fever 2004 - 75 Madden 2004 - 55 Madden just looks and feels too not real, Fever is ok, but still a distant second. If you're going to buy a football game this season get ESPN NFL 2K4, you won't regret it. Madden rides on all the hype, but that i believe is coming to an end. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its been about 8 ish years since Grand Tourismo first arrived on the PSone, i am now the owner of an XBOX and i kinda use GT1 as a bench mark, i really really hoped that Forza would take driving sims (on the XBOX) to that next level, it hasnt, i'm gutted, i give this game 2 out of ten because the box looks nice. If you want fun get NFSU2. Hire this out from blockbuster first before you buy, or buy mine! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An unbelievably long scavenger hunt and nothing more. The equivalent of solving a puzzle in your house and having to look for the pieces. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am so departed from this game's audience, that I fail to understand the target demographic's attraction to what is essentially a mix of 'barbie' and 'whatever soap you choose to make it'. This is one of the few games I cannot be objective about. Nothing struck me as insightful, engaging, entertaining, fun, progressive, or meaningful. I guess it was original for it's time. And that has to count for something. Right? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

God i hate this game. 15 minutes in and i became bored. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The problem with every sim game ever made is that although it's fun to build and create these interesting worlds of cities or people or whatever, after everything is completed, the game goes absolutely nowhere. Why the hell do I have to point and click for every little action my character needs to do? Can't he go to the bathroom on his own or clean up after himself? Character's brains are apparently the size of gumdrops as I groan over paying attetion to everything that I am forced to do to keep my sim healthy and sane. Playing this game for 20 minutes goes from being interesting to becoming an annoying chore that I never want to have to put up with ever again. Even cheats don't make things any easier or better. Play this game if you have lots of time on your hands or no life of your own. It is way too overated and people should be more aware of its huge flaws and problems.(And, it was replaced it with a much better game, No One Lives Forever.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not fun in the slightest sense of the word. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At first i thought this game was cool, because it was about warcraft. I played world of warcraft before it, so i wanted to play this. What a big mistake that was. The characters look completely cartoonish and can be compared to fisher price people. The idea of upgrading your buildings and troops seems cool at first, but it later gets annoying and you keep forgetting about it. On most maps you start off with about 10 people while the enemy has about 4 bases. The biggest armies consist of 16 people, making it feel more like a scouting party than an army. At first i liked the idea of heroes, but after a while you seem to use them for everything because they are way too powerful. They are basically the equvillant of 15 people, so you can defend your whole base with him and 5 people. The idea of needing air units to attack air units is also dumb. The average building can produce 1 or 2 types of troops, so you have to keep switching between buildings to produce different types of troops. Altogether it feels like 100 pots boiling at the same time. The only good part is the story. Its hard to make a strategy game that has bad graphics, gameplay, objectives, army sizes, and unbalanced characters all at once, but warcraft 3 rises to the challenge. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring anti-cheese game with no replay value whatsoever! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overrated game, like the whole Souls series of games. I have come to believe that Souls games are the "emperor has no clothes" thing of modern gaming. Trash games with poor game engine, graphics, animation, controls, game mechanics, character systems, enemies etc. Cheap games that try to sell the scam that they are "designed" that way, to masquerade their lack of investment. Then all of a sudden, kids don't want to say they don't like it, because their friends will tell them "git gud", and game reviewers who typically play all games at easy don't want to say those games suck to not lose their "reputation" as gamers (that is, unless they are bribed). Trust me, i have been gaming for almost 30 years, have played almost every game under the sun on PC,console and handheld. I was beating Zelda II on the NES without guides and internet as a kid, while most of the Dark Souls "git gud" kiddies weren't even born. The whole series sucks, save your money and time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're someone who thinks characters should talk and make sense and not speak so cryptic-ly that you're concerned they're mentally disabled i think  this game is not for you.

I give 2 points for the 'Ok' gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is hard. I don't have a problem with that, after all part of the fun of video games is the challenge. But the problem is that the lack of save checkpoints means that it very quickly becomes boring and tedious because you have to do the same thing over and over again. I stuck with it for a while, and even started to get a bit better but by that time I was over it and sold it on ebay. The sad thing is this could have been a good game if there were more save checkpoints. But I see that a lot of other people really like it so I have to concede its probably just not my game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never liked Dark Souls. Having got this in a PS4 bundle I thought I'd give it a go. I can see the attraction, however, this just isn't my type of game. Combat is clunky and somewhat repetitive (attack, wait, watch animation - repeat). I don't believe the merit of a game should lie in it's difficulty, and that was my biggest frustration. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Prepare to Die. Facing:  bad camera controls near enemies and walls; pointless trips through multiple loading screens just to refill items, (like knives, cocktails, oil, etc); controls that have you jumping into mobs, when you are trying to jump/side step away; lock on targeting that will sometime work, or sometimes spin you so you are facing away; controller actions that make you time just what "simultaneous" pressing means with analog controller sticks--and then, doesn't work consistently.

-- Bloodborne isn't an RPG, in that there is a "Narrative"--at all, but feel free to make one up.   It is more of a Tactical Action Game, with Leveling, and is very twitchy due to the mandatory dodge mechanic.  "Spoilers" in this game are the methods and tactics to take down bosses, (like the Watchdog of the Old Lords).  You won't really care what is happening in the game, let alone with your own character.  Bloodborne is certainly is a great game, and Chalice Dungeons makes it even better--but you will spend most of that thought on how to avoid game defects--like not getting close to walls where you would normally channel foes, and bait specific attacks from them--because you will be so mindful of the camera glitches that stop you from seeing anything 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game... play if you like having to be 100% accurate pressing the buttons and having the stick pointed in just the right direction. Any timing issue and you're dead, over and over and over. Play if you want little information about what to do next, replaying the same levels over and over while you grind up levels. There is no blocking, only dodging. Lots and lots of dodging. The Witcher 3 employed the same control scheme, and everyone agrees the movement and combat is clunky and buggy. The only redeeming quality is it looks good and is actually fun if you can progress. But seriously, don't bother. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is full of dated broken 1980s horrid gaming mechanics. Repetitive to the point of boredom. Poor controls, total lack of save points utter garbage.

If the game offered a difficulty level control I'd probably have spent more time with it. As it is if you are a casual, i'd highly recommend not to buy this game. The UI is piss-poor, the controls are clunky, and you'll die constantly due to a poor combat system that is more complicated than it needs to be. The lock on system is pure trash.

I gave this a 2 because the I like the graphical style and Ambience. The artists did a nice job with the game. It's a shame most people won't see their work though because they'll throw the game out the window after an hour. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When game bloodborn unfortunately I miss producing care. Unfortunately this game is just another darksous with different name and inferior quality. With few differences unfortunately not for the better , bloodborn adds nothing in the library of the PS4 that is different or better than the PS3 . Bloodborn is a PS3 game with low quality and that came supported the success of Darksols as many other games of this new generation is doing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good game , bad implementation

The game is great for experienced soul vets, but does nothing to bring in new players, in fact it goes actively out of its way to discourage them. Combine frequent deaths and long loading screens and you can imagine how well that goes, add in a duping bug that completely ruins pvp and it gets worse, but you might say I dont pvp, well you dont have a choice, if you get stuck on a boss and want to summon help you will get pvped, most likely by someone with uber duped stuff.

Add all of this together and if you aren't a souls fan and need help with bosses, you are not going to like this game.

The game looks great, plays great, but if you are a new player and don't like pvp with people who are duped to the ubergills, you are in for a punishing experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Load times are what really chap my butt. After playing every souls game, this is the worst load times by far. It's also a bit too easy for me. Not a 9/10, but a solid 6/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst game I've ever seen! for starters it doesn't make any sense on the plot side of things, the graphics are inferior to that of a ps2, the combat is sluggish, the desings are just nonsense and the audio it's like a clonic house of horror, enough of trying to sell this lie, don't buy this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I should have done my research more thoroughly before committing dollars on this one. I read a few reviews, and assumed I was buying very hard RPG. That's not at all what I bought. The game is hard, I'll give you that, but it's only hard for hardness' sake. It only brings needless repetition, and if you enjoy grinding same boss over and over and over and over and ooooooover and over and over again, then maybe this is the best thing. This game is pretty much flappy birds (in more than one way), and it probably draws similar audience. The real RPG features are fairly non-existent, which actually makes this game more of a hack'n'slash à la Diablo . The unintuitive controls make it more of a hack'n'die, though. I never finished the game, and I really don't want to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Marmite game.
You'll love it or hate it and nothing anyone else says will change that.
If you're into Dark Souls, you'll love it. If not, you'll quickly learn if you're into Dark Souls.
Despite soooo many glowing reviews and recommendations, I found the tedium of replaying the last 30 minutes of hack n slash every time you die, just to die again 2 minutes later than before (or worse, on your way through old ground) completely unacceptable in this day.
Sparse checkpoints isn't "punishing", it's just plain irritating.
It's one of those games you're supposed to love and you feel guilty or even mistaken for disliking it... "Maybe I didn't give it enough effort?"... 5 hours in and I deleted it from my hdd, it was that irritating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

10 out of 10 for this pile of garbage? What is wrong with people? I'm on my 3rd playthrough and I still need to find the thing that attracts people to this 'game'. It's way too easy but still so unfair. Hitboxes are godawful and all enemies have the same attacks. It's basically a dodge simmulator. This is a prime example of pure lazyness from developers. The fact that I'm even still playing this shows how less PlayStation has to offer.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think this could be a great game,but damn is it unforgiving in a mean way. I bought it used, and took it back 24 hours later because it just was not fun. I got to the 2nd boss and reached my limit, got tired of waiting for load screens and farming for items, only to get stun locked by the 3rd form of the boss. Just not fun at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply put if you like walking simulators and pretty visuals then you will like this game because there is nothing else to it. The only story is by what you see, the only gameplay is walk and jump that is it. There is zero reason to play this game a second time. Its not a game its an un interactive movie 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got this game after reading all the good reviews in here and in other sites. I was really looking forward to get into it. When the credits rolled after an hour and a half I could not believe it.  I'm sorry, this isn't even a game. You just go forward, that's it. And as far as the atmosphere goes, which is what everyone is praising, I played it after beating Bloodborne, so yeah, the bar was set way too high. Boring, short, not fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not understand the hype for this game. It's not challenging, you don't die, there's barely any story. It's just plain boring, and I was thankful it only went for 2 hours.
The graphics/visuals are nothing groundbreaking either, which is apparently the best part of the game.

By all means play it, but don't go in with high expectations 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OK, I understand different people like different game types but it's a head-scratcher that so many people claim to like this one. It's just bad. After 20 minutes of play, I was hoping a giant sand worm would pop up and eat my character ... but my hopes were dashed; the boredom continued unabated.

Pros: more gameplay than this company's previous game Flower, pretty string music, semi-interesting save point heiroglyphic-type map update video thinggy (no, I don't know what it was but it was better than the part you actually play).

Cons: abso-freaking-lutely boring, monochromatic levels (and no, not nearly so cool looking as Limbo), player interaction with the game is minimal, and I say again; BORING.

If you have $20 to burn for this game ... don't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is horrible , all you do is running...
You don't die
you don't kill
you don't have to jump to other platform like the old days
you don't do nothing

just a piece of garbage hyped... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

aburrido hasta decir basta, al menos dura poco, pero es hora y media de tu vida que ya no vuelve

es lo peor que he jugado hasta ahora en PS4, no ofrece ningún reto nada más que pasearse por un desierto 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could have been a great game, but the rushed-to-market instruments ruin it. While some have had luck with getting fixed instruments, we've spent months waiting for the 'fixed' hardware only to get the same faulty gear back. Unfortunately we can't even sell it, as the widespread failure rate on the hardware blocks GameStop from letting you sell it back - while it's a fun concept, the execution is miserable - everyone should just wait for Rock Band II rather than get screwed over by EA and Harmonix on this disaster. The brilliant concept is undeniable, the 4th rate hardware is inexcusable - if you're reading this ad thinking 'whatever, my drum pedal is fine' just give it a couple more weeks and I 'd bet money it's' busted - they knew the hardware was faulty and shipped it anyway just to make their holiday revenue look better - the gear is crap and woe be unto anyone who buys this and expects it to last more than a month - never have I seen a better example of reviews-gone-wrong than this, where the game itself is left unplayable by faulty hardware - avoid at all costs!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is mediocre compared to any Guitar Hero game. The only good thing is the song list, but the chinsey instruments and bad controls kill any reason to buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm halfway through UC3 and its hard to see how it'll get any better. There's ropey control systems and now there's Drake's Deception. A new nadir. Combat is painful in the extreme. The least frustrating way to deal with an enemy is to sprint to his position and punch him into submission. Saves the super-fiddley chore of agonisingly trying to twitch your gun sight onto him and fire. Naughty Dog: learn the difference between millimetres and metres, please.A recent reviewer here commented that "the 'cinematic gameplay' takes control away from the player and even adds movement to the character that's not coming from player input". There's no better way of putting it. What's the point of buying a game if half the time its playing you, rather than the other way around? Half the time the engine's just timing how quickly you pull down on the joystick before deciding whether to play the 'live' of 'die' cut-scene. The most extraordinary thing is that UC2 (an incredible game) had these issues, but only to a fraction of the same degree. How is it possible they've been amplified rather than further reduced in the upgrade? Rhetorical question: it's been rushed to market of course. You watch the User Metascore plummet as more players start to wake up to this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I want to be honest in this review and say that the uncharted series has never evolved in story nor game play.

basically you run around shoot people, solve puzzles which take less than 10 minutes to solve, climb stuff and collect useless treasures.
That's it, it is repetitive it is boring and some sections of the game and some characters feel unnecessary to the plot except that the developers wanted to insert extra levels.
If you are buying the game for the story then don't buy this game.

The title says "Drake's deception" but deception is nowhere to be found in the plot.

The story is a classical cliche, it jumps from Drake looking for a treasure to friends being in danger (this part only lasts a 2 minute cutscene), a love interest, to saving the world from bad guys trying to steal ancient treasure.

All these segments of the story are short, messed up and dull.

Co-op and multiplayer are quite the same formula.

As for visual and sound, they are fine, except for some gunfire sounds and all explosions. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The aiming controls.. Wow worst this gen by far, so stiff and inorganic. And the way the game is progressing is bad as well, almost every time you come to a new place, check it out, meet some enemies on the way, find something that makes the characters go WOW... Then someone sees you and the whole place crumbles as you escape. Painfully predictable.

The way characters pop up at perfect times out of nowhere all the time is cringeworthy as well. They ALWAYS find a way to come in front of you to deliver their cheesy line. This game is pretty badly written if you ask me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To start I would like to say that no... I didn't play this game when it first came out, I only played it last week. But if the game really aged this badly in only 3 (or really more like 2) years then this has to be a contender for worst first party game ever made. But why is it so bad well let me start with the first thing seen about the game the title (I get it don't judge a book by it's cover but still) Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception and as the title suggests (SPOILERS!!!) Drake gets infact, indeed, indubitably, deceived. But in all the other Uncharted games (SPOILERS!!!) Drake gets deceived then shouldn't it be more like: Uncharted Drake's Deception, Uncharted 2 Drake's Deception again, Uncharted 3 Drake you F*@#$^% idiot. But unfortunately this is the least of the game's problems because to be completely honest the best part about this game is the title screen infact I would rather just stare at the title screen for 6 1/2 hours then play this game for about just as long. But next I'll get the few good things about this thing out, the main theme is good all of the other music I can't remember but the main theme is good, the characters are generic but there not annoying or stupid... so better that then Last of Us, and also the graphics in the actual cutscenes are okey. But anything else ranges from bad to just plain garbage. I'll start with the story and... it's basically the same as the other Uncharted games, I'ld go more in depth but I don't want to have to click that contains spoilers box and I already have done quite a lot but what ever there's plenty more garbage that Naughty Dog dished out so don't worry about it. The control is just plain bad, it's infact so bad that I didn't even want to think that this game was a first party. What do I mean by this well firstly Nathan Drake who (SPOILERS!!!) is the main character of the game only jumps when he fricken feels like it, and you can't even imagine how annoying this is in a game like this when you are trying your best just to get Nathan to do a little kindergardener jump but instead he just head bangs like he's at a Nirvana concert. He also runs into invisible walls half the time when there's a cliff and the other half he just slips off like an idiot and goes plummeting to his death. Also for the fact that when your not aiming a gun the camera moves around like it's on speed, but once you aim a gun the camera then moves around like it's... well off of speed. And since the control is goins so much into the gameplay I might as well just go full in. So in terms of gameplay there are actually a lot of different kinds... of course they can't get any of them right though. First the swimming I hope you thought that Ocarina of Time was the best swimming was ever going to get because in Uncharted 3 it's worse. By this I mean that basically when you first start out in Ocarina of Time and when you first try to swim well imagine that except more stiff and a million people shooting instakill grenades at you. Then there is the climbing which just like the jumping only works when it feels like it. Some times the segments are as easy as spamming X while holding up and sometimes they just don't work and force you to exhaust every possible option until finally you get it right. But you know what the best part is? it's when you try to jump to something that seems obvious to get on but when you jump to them you go falling to your death again. Then there is of course the walk around like an idiot for 10 minutes to elongate gameplay while searching for something or just walking in a straight line. Oh but before I get to the actual combat I have to get to one of the best parts of the game... in game cutscenes. Oh my god are they hilarious because not only does the game begin to look worse while in these cutscenes but they also decide to give Nathan and (SPOILERS) Sully the ability to teleport into a completely different position durning one of these and then teleport back like nothing ever happened. Then the big one the fighting mechanics. First of all the melee combat, I will say it's not completely a cutscene but it's a button masher and a bad one at that. You can also apparently kill enemies by landing on them but it never worked for me except for the first level. The shooting as I mentioned before is very stiff and there have been times where I had to follow an enemy across the screen because the cursor moved like a slug. But of course with all of that obviously you should be assaulted by ten thousand responding enemies who can take sniper bullets to the head right. Well no but it's in the game anyway. But by far the worst part of the game is the fricken RPG's, because not only are they an instakill but they also will send Nathan into an omg something exploded remotely close to me animation if it explodes anywhere near you. And of course there are armored guys that take 200 hits to kill and can't be meleed. So in the end this game isn't worth a 10/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh. In prevision of Unchartered 4, I played 2 and 3 back to back. I loved 2, and hated 3. Much like everyone reviewed, the graphics are stellar and it's a pretty game, but that's about all it offered. No puzzles whatsoever, plot is lame, story is identical to UC2, too many cut scenes and WAY too many movies that offer no interest, since the story doesn't either. Fighting is way off, and if you're not fighting a dozen people armed with RPGs or  wanting to get punched in the face, you're climbing and jumping the EXACT same path over and over again. Or you're just walking around aimlessly for no reason other than pretending the game is not as short as it actually is. Essentially, Naughty Dog provided an uninspired, cheap, and lazy game for the purpose of making a buck. This game is such a terrible mockery that I won't be buying UC4 after all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another entry into the highly overrated series. This one was the worst. towards the end the gameplay gets clumsy not to mention the story is trash. The recent tomb raider series puts these uncharted games to shame. There really isn't much freedom in these games your lead by the hand through everything. No replay value. Buy tomb Raider reboot instead now thts a real game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bon bah un BTA clairement bien réalisé, très joli, bonne VF mais toujours la caméra fixe et les esquives avec le stick droit (c'est débile). Cela reste également un gros couloir bourré de scripts et de QTE en tous genres et en tant que BTA, c'est très vite lassant et répétitif : mon pouce a dit non. Un pseudo-jeu tout dans l'esbroufe, le strass et les paillettes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disgustingly overrated, yet another boring first person shooter with no attempt whatsoever in improving gameplay, it feels almost like the first one with better graphics and different models. I would be kicking myself if Crysis didn't come out, as it would mean that I upgraded my computer just for DOD4. If you are a beginner for shooters? Then this might be an option, but if you've played fps for over 10 years? Then this would simply be awful. "Nice" features: Fairly flashy graphics, bullet - wall penetration system (wow, valve did that with counter strike 10 years ago). Multiplayer is fun for the first few plays, so I guess that might be why I gave it a 2 instead of a 0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought COD4 was too unrealistic, catering to the shallow tastes of those who have no realistic representation of real world combat. Multiplayer is a joke, it's just a spamfest full of people who complain when you use a more effective way to kill them then they used against them, claiming they have more skill than you although they clearly lost. "In war, if you have to fight fair, you are doing something wrong" is something I tell them that usually shuts up the smart ones. The single player mission, while having a new and innovative story-line was full of Hollywood-style ya-ya's, utter crap. The producer clearly catered towards the "WOW" effect and not the, "Let's get this right effect". I feel that they should have done their research and put out a title that would be a solid representation of what our service men and women endure every day, as a window to the world of what these people do for their countries. Not some spamfest Hollywood bullcrap spree. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The single player campaign serves as a really nice mod for COD2 (graphics really haven't improved since), but come on asking full price for the same old tired linear gameplay and contrived story? MP is a little better but still suffers from being overly arcadey. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another mindless corridor shooter. Ridiculously short, no interaction with your squadmates. Doors can't be opened, windows that can't be broken. 30 cm high fences that you can't climb over. Ridiculously scripted, mindless AI. Infinite enemy spawning until you move one more foot. The great graphics can't save this one. Utterly disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game would be so much fun but unfortunately it is broken on PS3 and unplayable after a while. Screw you Bathesda for knowingly releasing a full-price AAA game that gets unplayable after a certain amount of time. I will never buy a game of yours for more than 15$ again. I had the same issues wuth Fallout 3 and Fallout NV and tried to ignore it because the I liked the games - but this time it is just too much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I own the PS3 version of this game and because of the immense amount of game breaking bugs I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone.  Bethesda knowingly released a broken game to the public.  This a shameful act and therefore the score needs to reflect that.  The only reason it gets a 2 instead of 0 is because when the game works its a lot of fun but right now my copy is unplayable so the score will reflect it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sigh... I wanted to love this game as much as I did Morrowind and Oblivion and I did right up until the point my PS3 seemed to choke to death. Sure a reboot clears the problem for a short amount of time but the ugly problem of display lag appears again to taunt you one more time. What I have played is fantastic, it is only the framerates and broken quest lines that are the deal breaker for me. I never expected zero bugs, just not such glaringly obvious ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What starts off as an epic adventure as advertised quickly becomes an exercise in patience as constant framerate drops and input lag plague the game a handful of hours into your play session.  Unless you like playing the first 1/5 of every game and then restart, this is not for you.It's unfortunate, but Bethesda gets a 2 for this as it stands now.  Until patched, the game is unplayable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll get about 32$ for a 60$ game at Microplay, in exchange of another game, After that they cry when poeple hack the PC version. Us fellow PS3 user we get what, an unfinished game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dear Bethesda......... I'm used to bugs in your games (I think everyone is!). I'm also mostly OK with the outdated tech, the clunky combat, the poor dialogue, and all the other staples of your games since Oblivion, because you do know how to make a good game world, and for that I can overlook a lot of issues. ........... However, what I cannot overlook is that this game is BROKEN on PS3. Broken meaning 'does not work'. At all. As in, 7 to 0 FPS during combat. .......... Next time, if you know you can't make a PS3 version without it being literally worthless (except for the opening 20 hours or so) then just don't release it on Playstation. It would hurt us PS3 owners, but not as much as the false hope this broken port gives. -Loco 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

very disappointed with lag and other glitches - can't believe the camera in the opening cut scene was not even attached correctly...  This is one I won't finish... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If your thinking of buying the ps3 version of skyrim don't , by any means till the problems that occurs on the game is fixed. One big problem the game sufferers with is horrible frame-rate issues and lag on the ps3 version. You get up to 6mb of data your going to start noticing the game in slow-motion all the time.  The game isn't totally broken you can still play it but having to do all certain tricks like reloaded your saves back on your ps3 or deleting the install of the game and reinstalling etc etc starts to get real annoying after awhile. I have 113 hours in 12mb and with in maybe 30 mins to hour the game does nothing but lag and the frame-rate becomes nothing but a problem. The game also sufferers major from broken quest's, even main quest's that effect the main story of the game are broken with bugs/glitches. nobody should be giving this game a perfect 10 especially the ps3 version of it. How does a game that has more bugs and glitches than any game that's pretty much out get a 10.  Bethesda  blew it big time on the ps3 version of skyrim. This game should of been tested first even delayed til the problems of this game were close to perfect.  Game gets a 2 due to the replay value of the game and that's about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To clarify things I still stand by my initial review.The reason why the rating is dropping is not due to trolls.All of the unhappy Skyrim owners from the official forums are joining together.We are all making the effort to express are disdain about the ps3 version of this game.When you unify and mobilize people to actually speak there minds on one one these forums this is what you can expect. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game starts out as good, if not better, than all the hype.  My problem from the game it's self comes from the lack of testing or caring towards ps3 owners.  The game moves along fine until maybe a dozen or so hours in.  At this point things start lagging and only degenerate from there into an almost unplayable mess.  Quests seem to be broken left, right and center.  It's a gorgeous game that was never built from the ground up for the ps3 and thus we suffer with what ultimately becomes an unplayable, bug ridden mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such an amazing game ruined by all of its bugs ,the ps3 owners were once again let down,the game lags so badly that you can't even play the game.Your review must be at least 150 characters long. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Best and worst time with a game. Skyrim is an amazing game but I want to single out the PS3 version. I don't have a PC or an Xbox 360 so I was forced to try this version. It started off pretty well with very little problems. About 10 hours in with a 6mb save file, things started to go sour. I started to experience crazy amounts of lag that ruined game play. I implore anybody to get another version if they can. DO NOT BUY THE PS3 VERSION (or wait to see if it can be fixed). In addition to the lag problem, the ps3 version also has the worst visuals of the 3 platforms. This wasn't a big deal to me but it's worth noting for the people that care. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not as good as it was hyped to be. 1st) It is broken, bugs, glitches, lag galore, even fixed, the bugs and glitches are EVERYWHERE! I mean quest bugs are almost all the time, people multiply, dragons kill quest characters, list goes on and on. (yes I do realize this is a "huge" and "open world game" But there is plenty of games that are open world with less glitches. 2nd) No spellcrafting, yeah this is a big failure, as all of TES, had this function, and no it does not make magic more "spreadsheety" and even if it did, magic is a science, and you did not do a good job of avoiding it Bethesda, as it has duration/damage/range....3rd) Uninteresting and bland, the story is not even a story, and lose interest in it, the factions are the shortest thing ever besides the war, and those are just repeat quests over and over. The combat is boring and weak, it should be more like Dark Souls.... Exploration is fun for about a week.... 4th) Lies... What happened to the economy thing Bethesda? That we could destroy the woodmills, work with the windmills, destroying the economy or build it up, as you sell more of one item it loses value and ect. Hrm.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sadly my previous review must drop from mixed to negative, this game just doesnt stack up against other TES games (Morrowind) this game just isnt what it should be,short story, non-immersive gameplay, worse bugs than morrowind, and HORRIBLE voice actors! The first time I played Morrowind, yeah it was hard, but it really stood out and i put 300+ hours into it, I tried this game, I REALLY wanted to like it I really did, but this game is just too awful to get anything else, its overall a bad game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had the PS3 version before I bought the PC version. Now I can riff about all the bugs and crashes & technical issues in the game, but they have been stated enough. Because the fact of the matter is, even if Bethseda fixed all of those problems, the game is still a streamlined borefest. Read my PC review to find out why buying the PC version still didn't change my mind of how much of a dissapointment this game was. Even on the PC version with all of the best mods, I couldn't bring myself to play the game for more than 20 minutes before feeling like I wasting my time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To start with I have played over 100 hours of this game. It is fun, creative, and ambitious. Unfortunately this game is broken on the PS3. There are serious lag problems with large save files, which Bethesda has no idea of how to fix. The game crashes at multiple points, it has become less about exploring the world and more about walking a mine field trying not to crash it. This game should never have been released, in this state. Bethesda has completely lost all of my confidence for releasing this game as is. I refuse to believe that their QA dept missed these bugs, they are to easy to reproduce. So that means Bethesda knowingly released a broken game. I am torn in two about this game, its an enjoyable ride, but once you get deep into it, it loses all the fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is brilliant. The design, the atmosphere... It's amazing. Easily one of the best games this generation. But it seems that I bought it on the wrong system. I can understand a couple day one hiccups, but seriously Bethesda? This is ridiculous. I have had to restart the game twice now simply because a game breaking bug would happen during the main quest line, rendering completion of the story impossible. That, coupled with the amount of time I have stared at a blank screen while resetting my ps3 because Skyrim froze is just the tip of the iceberg. Sound cutting out, textures vanishing, saves getting corrupt, this version has it all. Even then, if I turn a blind eye to the fact that the ps3 version obviously wasn't tested enough (show me a Bethesda rep who says otherwise and I'll show you a liar) the worst part is that you released it knowing full well about these issues. I mean, why else would you not send out ps3 review copies to popular review sites? I think that is worse then the game being so broken, but I digress....I hope that you see this user rating and read these reviews, and happen across mine. You already have my money for this game, and the only reason I am holding onto the unplayable frustration that is Skyrim is because I know the masterpiece it can be with the proper steps taken to improve it. I was looking forward to Prey 2, but I will not be purchasing it now. I know I alone will not make a difference, but I can only hope that my fellow gamers and I can send a message to all developers out there who think this is okay, in hopes of bettering the industry we all love. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game was great until it become unplayable. The outside world (and sometimes even inner buildings) began to perform like a slow paced power point presentation after I put many hours into the game. Hopefully Bethesda will at least provide a fix to make the game somewhat playable at least. I had the occasional slow downs in my many hours put into Oblivion and Fallout 3 on PS3, but this is just ridiculous. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at this point in time (at least on PS3). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunate that I have to give my most anticipated game of this year a 2. Why does it get such a terrible score? Because after your save file grows between 7mb-8mb+ the game becomes completely unplayable. Why not give it a 0 then? Because this game is still amazing and I got an amazing 40 hours out of it and I thought that should count for something. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The atmosphere of the game and the open worldedness is everything you'd expect when getting a Elder Scrolls game.  However for PC players, like myself, its a dissappointing console port.  Bethesda didn't even optimize the menus for keyboard and mouse.  I was hoping for more of a morrowind feel and got worse the oblivion feel.  Even the graphics were really poor in my opinion obviously made for 3 year old hardware like in consoles.  Its not horrible as far a games go however PC gamers will proberbly have to wait for mods to fix a game mad without thought to the PC 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game seemed unfinished and lazily thought out.  Quests were short and easy, and the the lack of customization made game boring.  I wanted a full rpg experience but didn't get one.  Oblivion content wise was better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to make this short and sweet:As a game, this title is amazing.  On the PS3 platform, it's a broken piece of garbage.  Depending on your play style, if you like exploring and such, the game shows its true colors about 10 hours in.  Once your save file is over 5mb in size, you'll have problems with auto-saving (it will freeze up your PS3, force a hard reset, and if you're lucky, your PS3 will decide data is corrupted and perform the PS3 equivalent of a scandisk to try to recover your files.  Luckily I've never had anything corrupted other than skyrim data... yet.) and if you turn off auto-save, you'll still eventually get a game that devolves into a slideshow whenever there's more than 2 characters active on the screen.Bottom line: if you have a PC or 360, get the game on one of those platforms.  If you buy the game on PS3, you will regret it.  If you don't have a PC or 360, skip this game... at least until the day Bethesda patches the game and fixes all the game breaking technical issues.  However, if the recent Fallout titles were any indication, this game won't be fixed... buyer beware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Plays ok at first then stutters more and more as the save file grows. Patch is released and reduces stutter mainly by clearing corpses and simplifying some graphics. Now machines can just hard freeze at random in any area post patch. This could have been a great game but the bugs are killing it, avoid it for now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I honestly can't remember ever being this disappointed in a game (other than Gran Turismo 5 that is).  The game starts off pretty good but after a while just descends into sheer tedium. Almost all the quests are pretty much the same. Sure you can do plenty of other stuff like smithing (ok), mining (yawn), cooking (what's the point?) etc...but the best of these pastimes grows old quickly. There is bugger all character  involvement - nobody has more than two or three (non quest related) lines of dialogue. Once you finish the main quest the game's flat out boring. The big problem though, is that the game is simply broken on PS3. I won't recite the long list of problems, as they are all well documented here and elsewhere, but this game is simply unplayable after a short while. It's an absolute joke - don't Bethesda have game testers???  I think when we're paying over $100 for a game we're entitled to hope that the thing works for more than a day or two. I guess it's another product of the current mentality of "ship the game regardless & we'll rely on DLC & patches to put things right" that is prevalent in game developers these days. Unfortunately Bethesda don't seem to be interested in fixing this game for some reason. It's just pathetic. Don't waste your money on this game on PS3. Honestly, if you're after a good RPG for PS3 check out Dragon Age: Origins (1 - not 2) or Demon's & Dark Souls, they're much, MUCH better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rate 2 for this game because I waste my precious $60 for this game but I'm nice to enough give this game rate 2 . They are very lag , freezing out , ridiculously glitches/bugs , and the updates are fail to follow up . I hate to start over when they were freezing out and I have to play for other 4-5 hours . However , if they update and getting better and I would change my rate and review for this game . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes I was one of those people who got hit by the horrible crippling lag that comes with playing this game for a great length of time. It's truly sad because this game would easily be the game of the year if those bugs weren't in the game but I truly believe you need to take something like this into account when you make a decision like that. I actually traded this version in for the 360 one because I wanted to get the full experience out this game and not have to pick and choose what I want to do before the game's crippling lag keeps me from continuing. So a word of advice for anyone planning to buy this game: DO NOT BUY IT ON THE PS3!!!! If I can convey anything to anyone with this review it would be that. Stay very far away from this version and get another one. You won't regret it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Many of my friends had told me how awesome this game was and was for the first 30 seconds I continued on though hoping that farther you got the better it would get but sadly it didn't. The music is bland and not half as good as Guilty Gear X2 and the story is bland and unattractive. The weapon system is a good idea but not when the better weapon is just the more expensive one, I mean lame. So if you want a fighting game go pick up Guilty Gear X2 or if you like 3D more go get Tekken 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story, the overall composition and many details would make this game a masterpiece...if the steering and viewpoint issues would ruin everything! The cars behave ok, only the lagging viewpoint behavior lets you run over everything. But the planes, which become a crucial thing on several missions make the whole game a disaster. They are so uncontrollable, they annoy you like hell to the point where you don't want to play on. GTA:SA is just one more example of a game ported absolutely care- and loveless to the PC, lurking the bucks out of those PC jerks for nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a poor translation of a console game. The graphics are ugly, the controls and physics are worse and the camera is blare witch mess. The mini games are just button mashing exercises while the camera points everywhere except the direction you are going. Not that you are missing much; the graphics are washed out and sparse. Unlike other GTA titles the hoods' lack any personality or flavor.. Skip this one until the next real PC version of the GTA franchise comes out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

V 2.0 for PC. Totally sucks. Non-moddable? I want my freaking money back! Game requires you do some crap moves on a computer that I see in my 10 year old daughter's PS2 games! Ummm... Earth to Rockstar... Adults don't like doing repetitive motion exercises... too much like work. it's rated mature, but has crap like this? The developers transferred this from a console game to a PC game apparently without any knowledge of PC gaming. Removing the "Hot Coffee" scenes: fine with me, couldn't care less. Removing the girlfriends altogether would have been more realistic. If I was the protaganist in GTA:SA and Denise mouthed off to me, it would be entirely within character to give her a Molotov rather than flowers. But making it non-moddable unforgiveable with a PC game. Half of the fun of PC gaming is modding them or playing other people's mods. I mean, Rockstar doesn't exactly employ geniuses when it comes to the actual story writing. This wasn't even worth the reduced $15 price tag with all the bugs (patch released for fixes doesn't work for V.2, but the patch fixes those bugs - just plain stupid Release Management). Gave it a 2 just because I like running people over on sidewalks after driving home from work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How can a game be called Grand Theft Auto when there is no wheel support for PC. For a game that has lots of driving involved, I can't believe Rockstar didn't have the competancy to include support for a wheel. Anyone who thought they might be hooning around the streets, "Driving" their car, will be severly dissapointed with this lame offering. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible graphics, lazy camera. A complete disaster in game design and control. The PS2 version is a million times greater. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the controls are crap and the screen jumps and its not very clear, this shud ov been made much betta i want my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To be honest this isnt really a game, ITS A DRUG! I got hooked on it for 4 months and the whole time I was complaining to myself and my friends about all of the flaws and yet I still played it non-stop. The Flaws: 1. Completly rubbish and unbalanced starting areas. 2. Completly rubbish and unbalanced classes. (Warrior sucks, Warlock is a demon) 3. Terrible graphics and the geography dosnt make sense. (Snowy Mountain Ranges next to Tropical Jungles) 4. 60 out of 70 levels are there to make you pay more. All the GOOD features are reserved for the high levels, ok there are a few quests early on, but after level 10 its just a grind fest that slowly gets more and more tedious until you get to level 30 when you will either: A. Realise your wasting your life, uninstall the game, cancel your account and warn everyone about this game. OR B. Keep playing until your skin turns green from sunlight depravation, then realise that your dog has died and you should have probably fed it instead of playing the game. But seriously this game is waste of your money and your life, dont try it youll get hooked but after seeing the light you will look back and ask: "How did i find a reason to pay for that piece of poo?" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totally overrated. Blizzard is one of my favourite companies, however this monstrosity of an MMO will leave you disappointed dispite all the hype. At first glance, you will be in awe of the vast and creative world set before you. The huge world that requires very little loading between zones presents to you a huge task of WALKING everywhere until you hit level 40. At first you will hit level 5 and go this is great, and then you will hit level 10 and will soon realize that you are running in circles. This repetitive gameplay will annoy and frustrate you and you will soon discover that its like this the whole game all the way up until you hit level 60. And the expansion, they follow the same format, AWE and then disgust/boredom up until level 70. Anyone who says this game deserves a 10 has absolutely no idea what they are talking about, or has chosen this game to be their first MMORPG.

I played it. From launch. It was fun. Then I actually got past the first 30 or so levels. Have fun on one of the worst grinds ever. When you finally get to cap, have fun having to raid and farm from about 10x longer and more frequently to stay on top, you still don't have any good gear by the time you get to 60. PvP is uninspired, only the people who do it often know how to play. Ultimately it is a addictive MMO on easy mode, the main selling point being the addicting aspect, please do us all a favour and do what you will do months down the road out of frusturation anyway. Quit. Quit and delete your account so you arn't tempted to go back, you will be astounded how much of your time you get back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game will destroy your life. 15 dollars a month to click on monsters? The combat is about as deep as a puddle. Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will give this game a 2 because when I first played it I was in awe of the vastness of the game.  But as I leveled up I began to realize how repetitive it was.  I began to grow bored of it and eventually canceled my account.  Wow was fun but the monthly fee takes my vote from a 7 to a 1.  I now play guild wars which is a much more satisfying game.  because of the no monthly fee you can play it whenever you want with ought feeling like your wasting your money when you're not.  I hope many wow players will switch to guild wars and support it for guild wars 2 which should be amazing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Interesting how people who love the game really can't say why the love the game, only that lots of people do in fact love it. It's redundant, repetitive (hehe), and nothing that isn't every other MMORPG except for anyone can play it. It's simplistic lacking strategy or skill, those who play will find themselves mistaking their characters effectiveness at "pwning" as reaffirmation of their own abilities, unfortunately this is a fallacy. I agree with G W in that people who are addicted are forced into saying they love it because otherwise dissonance would settle due to the conflicting ideas of "this is a bad game" and "I play this game". On the other hand we all have our terrible guilty pleasure of a game (mine is Samurai Warriors) that we love accepting that the game is severely lacking in challenge. Plus, some people need to be validated as human beings and the reaffirmation that they can succeed merely by investing an amount of time sufficient to level up is needed for maintaining their self esteem (no offense to said people). In summary, the game fills or creates a compulsive niche in many peoples psychology such that the true quality of the game becomes obscured and insignificant in comparison to attaining one more fix... one more level. I consider this less a game and more a money grab that abusing a dependence.

Graphics: 2 (lame graphics, seriously) Gameplay: 2 (very boring and repetitive, no skill) Installation: 1 (download updates? 800mb?) Storyline: 1 (there basically isnt one) Variation: 2 (a few types of missions, for 70 levels) Detail: 10 (so many weapons,armour,vendors,places to go etc.) Overall: 4 (Worth seeing, but its a game for those with little talent who like to play mindlessly with the ability to look really good. Good depth but little gameplay value) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably one of the worst MMO's I have ever played. The whole boring journey to get to 70 is the same thing over and over with overused models and skinned items (usually just a difference in color). The quests are dull even at 70 with going out and killing a certain amount of monsters then coming back. Although some of the last quests are quite fun but there are only 2-3 of them that actually are. The only time I had excitement was when I hit 70, which only lasted about 5 minutes. To level you must grind, do horrible quests that will want to make you kill yourself, or instances with either 10 year olds (Alliance) or people that need to get jobs and move out of their parent's houses (Horde). Upon getting to 70 you waste your life doing either raiding or PvP. Raiding first of all is fun the first time but then gets repetitive by the 10th time you do it. PvP requires you to wait 10 minutes to get in a battle ground and just end up losing or Arena which is fun but can be very frustrating and annoying. Getting one piece of gear usually takes a whole 1-2 days of sitting in front of a computer. The point of doing these is to get better gear to do better in PvP or raiding. But the only point to PvP or Raid is to get better gear... Didn't make much sense to me. This gear is fun at first but then you realize you wasted your time when you find out the next expansion is coming out and it will be worthless. If that isn't bad enough you must get 10 more levels with the same quests and poorly skinned models as before. People say omg it's the best game ever!11! but that's just because they don't want to admit they wasted their life and lost everything they had before. Don't waste your time or money, which you must give up a lot of for this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ya the game looks good but really you pay about 50.00$ for the game then get all exited and find out you still have to pay 15.00$ a month what crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WoW is a game lacking in innovation.  The only real reason it has survived is because it originates from a great RTS series, whose story line it killed.  It's graphics are also a tragedy of modern gaming.  The only value of the game is if you are playing on a private server, at least then you don't have to pay the subscription fees.  Not to mention the fact that the only way to really get far is to become over absorbed, make it your life, and grind like crazy.  If your looking for a good entry level RPG look at Guild Wars.  Its cheaper, skill based, and there are no subscription fees.  The least they could have done was at least preserve the good story line that made the real Warcraft games such classics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is is great , adventerous fun game ,.....when u can play.i would rate this game at a much higher level, if i could actually get on the game and play for any period of time without the world sever going down. i work no less than 10 hours and up to 15 hours a day. i pay a fee to play this game . there are many other sources of entertainment that i could spend money on . i would love to spend my free time on this game ,....as i enjoy it . however ,i will not pay my hard earned money on gametime that i have to sit through half of my login time to wait for a world server to open . as this continues ,it reminds me , my time is money my entertainment is your money . my superiors in my career field inform my associates and i ,on a daily basis , that our lack of preperation, is not their problem .they can withdraw their payroll at anytime by releasing the individual or individuals ,who cannot correct the problem. As a customer i feel that i have the same right . I also feel that restitution for the pactience that i have endured up this point is in order. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not bad, but not the best. This game is incredibly stale and for some reason a subscription based MMO. I understand it is difficult to keep up servers for millions of people (back in 2004) , however that does not mean the price should be the same. As hosting the game does not require extremely high end servers compared to EVE online, where every core counts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A highly overrated, super expensive game. Also sadly addicting. I have seen people get divorced over this game. Luckily, I have not fallen victim of this game. I have quit playing and regret every second spent playing. If you want to be a normal gamer who is not an addict to some stupid online fad, by all means do NOT break the piggy bank and buy this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game gets a 2 from me. Graphics: 5 (Lame but yet stylistic). Gameplay: 1 Same old crap that got boring in Ultima Online. Detail 9 The game is very detailed and vast i give it that. -8 For not being immersive at all though you don't feel included in the storyline what so ever - Not like there is one really anyway. Community: 2 Some good people in there but mostly full of hunched teenagers that spend countless hours doing the same chores. It's all gear based. TBC imo ruined it, lots of classes were dumbed down and then buffed needlessly. Addiction, even though i found this game utter sh*te i have many friends who are addicted to this. Beware! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WoW has been many things over the years. Its highest measure of success--its popularity--is ultimately its downfall. The community, which was barely tolerable to begin with, is absolute garbage now, 5 years post-launch. Once the crown jewel of the MMO world, a brilliant synthesis of the best ideas of previous MMOs, WoW is now the red-headed stepchild that everyone loves to bash, even while they admit to being addicted to it. To reiterate: worst community ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played it for almost 2 years now, and just quit. I've done it all: PVP, Arena, raiding, grinding, achievements, topping DPS charts... and I'm quitting because I just can't stand the community anymore. If you're a normal, balanced adult, you'll find that, no matter how hard you try to shield yourself from it, the sheer amount of HORRIBLE PEOPLE who play this game will drive you away. I like WoW. But it's just not feasible to play a game made for dishonest sociopaths. You can't truly enjoy PVP battlegrounds because almost everyone on your side is busy AFK'ing and complaining about people wanting to actually win the damn thing. Can't enjoy Arena either, because you either lose to drooling sociopaths, or team up with them and have to do as you're told. Can't enjoy raiding either, because, in a PuG, you're either going to be cheated out of loot, or are going to spend 6 hours racking up repair bills, and never finish the damn thing. In a guild run, you're going to face the same thing, plus being harassed by the RL's pals, GF or family members, who think they deserve more than anyone for half the effort, and who usually get away with it. If you decide to make your own guild, everyone in it will fight amongst themselves, making your life miserable. All that nastiness is fed by Blizzard with a silver spoon: Blizzard knows that the best addicts are the mean ones, the ones who'll kill people for drug money, so they'll bend what little "story" the game has to feed into that mentality (Trial of the Crusader is a fine example), along with jerk-rewarding loot rules that make ninja'ing not only accepted, but expected. Blizzard has already announced Cataclysm to invest even MORE in that hate factor, with heightened competitiveness inside guilds. Now you won't just have to grind for repair gold, buff foods, reputation, mounts, flasks, gear, get all the addons you can and scan Elitist Jerks every week for the latest changes to DPS rotations in your class to get a raiding spot, you'll ALSO have to grind guild rep by doing quests and PVP so your Guild Leader can grab some nice stuff and give it to his brown nosing pals. No thanks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok admins time to wake up and smell the roses this game is not worth it. The admins have to be the most inconsiderate, impolite people I have ever met. They ignore almost all user import. I wanted to write a letter to Blizzard telling them how impolite they are. Ive been told twice to f--k off and to shut the f--k up. Oh and uberness, whats the point of playing when the rogues and shamans were unbeatable?!? Lag is terrible..... no fixes. And just to inform you I DONT CARE ABOUT BATTLEGROUNDS!!!! Id rather enjoy a lag free game. I tried to return it but they wouldnt take it so i did what i thought was best, I snapped the cd in half and threw it out, cancelled my subscription and vowed never to play it again. I gave it a two because it had some good features that i will not get into. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While the game is the MMO with the largest player base, does it really deserve it? I mean seriously Blizzard,  we already bought the game, why would we have to pay every month to play it. You can't put a price on entertainment. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this game is entertaining, let's be honest, it isn't. I mean it's fun for a while, then it gets super repetitive. Boring fetch quests, mindless grinding, repetitive quests (talk to that person, bring me the letter he will give you, go back to him and give him this, then come back to me...). It all gets super boring in the end at least for me. Let's not even talk about the subscription. I've already talked about it a bit in the beginning of this review, but I feel like it's not enough.
Let me bring up that the subscription you have to pay per month, is pretty big. I mean 15 euros for a month of grinding and repetitive quests? Doesn't seem like that good of a deal to me.
Seriously Blizzard, why don't you actually work on making the game fun, rather than inventing new methods to squeeze the most money out of your players. World of Warcraft should look up to
Guild Wars 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although it does have some replay value, this game just sucks. MMORPGS aren't at all that great in my opinion, and WoW is quite an overated game situated in this category. If the harsh graphics, ear piercing sound, and mindless gameplay don't turn you off of this game, the community should. My advise, don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Massive disappointment.  I loved LIMBO and this has the same look and feel overall but I was left wondering why I wasted my time.  It starts off well enough but as each of the 4 short hours pass it the enjoyment dwindles until you just want it to be over.  The turning point for me was when something that has been an 'enemy' suddenly 'helps' you and whatever the heck the final minutes of the game was, my wife walked in while playing and was like WTF!?!?!... I echo her sentiment.  I purchased it on editorial reviews as I did Gone Home a few years back and it isn't often I think the consensus is so far off base but like Gone Home, for the record a WORSE game, I do not get the scores at all.  Pretty, cool animations, easy 'puzzles' and what story... not a good one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Does anyone notice how terrible the ending is?
The entire game was beautiful and was building up to something. An excellent story was brewing up.
During the time I experienced the game, there was an exciting build up with tons of emotions going through me. It was glorious. Then the ending came. You get sucked into this glowing hole and the tension was real until you come into this chamber in a very, very anti-climactic and unsatisfying way and then you absorb yourself into this ball of people and escape the complex. Ultimate retard ending.

I was absolutely livid. I felt played and trolled by Play Dead for ruining something that could have been ground-breaking. They had to make it disappointing on purpose or I really don't know what to think. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mass Effect 3 suffers from two major mistakes made by Bioware's game directors and I'm starting to notice an unfortunate trend in their sequels. The first problem is that ME3 plays like Dragon Age 2. Both games were rushed to market and seem to ignore what the fans loved most about the first title. The second issue is the addition of a multiplayer component to the game. It obviously detracted from time spent on the overall quality of the game. Todd Howard, game director for Skyrim put it beautifully when asked why Bethesda didn't include a cooperative feature in their latest Elder Scrolls game: "We always look into multiplayer, put lots of ideas on the whiteboard, and it always loses. It's not that we don't like it. I can think of ways it would be a lot of fun, but at the end of the day, that dev[eloper] time is going to take away from doing the best single-player game we can, and that's where our hearts are." Enough said. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a big ME1/2 fan. ME3 was a terrible disappointment, a complete retread of stories from the first two games, plus a bad storyline, cliched characters (including a psycho killer right out of a bad Hollywood action movie), contrived plot elements, and a HUGE Deus Ex Machina plot hole.  Linear gameplay.  Forced choices. Deeply resembles a bad Hollywood sequel. Where are the cool ideas and great dialog from the 1st two games? Not here. I played as a no-romance paragon, so the romance controversy did not factor in my judgment of the game. I was not even aware of the controversy until a few minutes ago.  One warning, the emotional balance of the first two games, with humor and other factors lifting the player's emotions, is missing here.  There are unremitting scenes of personal loss, death of loved ones, failure, and wholesale destruction that will leave the player drained and depressed.  It is possible to witness the deaths of multiple team mates, all in a row, plus attend a funeral, and a bit later witness the suicide of another character.  ME3 is a uniquely negative event in gaming. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game started great, the story, the characters, the scope. There were a few mechanical quirks and bugs but by far and away nothing noteworthy or that diminished my enjoyment in any way. The issue is the ending, the grand promises of vastly different endings turned into 3 separate endings that are differentiated by a slight recoloring. Red vs Blue vs Green ambient lighting. Really? It not only made little to no sense, but it spoiled the entire franchise for myself. Going into the game I expected to play and beat it at least 5 times closer to 10 for all the different Shepard's I had created. Instead, I put it down and will probably never pick up Mass Effect, any of the three, again. It ruined the series that much for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ultimately no matter what path was chosen, what actions where taken, who lived and who died, at the end of this journey, all that remains is your ship and your crew abandon you.The first 95% of the game is amazing, its everything I hoped for and more.  The last 5% is the biggest slap in the face imaginable.  If you have invested 100's of hours from the first game until this one, you will be left stunned and appalled that none of the choices you made, none of the battles you fought, nothing you did in those 100's of hours ultimately pays off in any of the three endings you can pick from.  With the three endings and the DLC on day 1, EA/Bioware show that fan support means nothing more than a dollar symbol to them.  While most of the joy lays in the journey to the end of the game, there is no replay value at all in this game, because no matter what journey you take, the ends are all ultimately the same except for color variations and if synthetics live or die. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I did NOT play the single player yet, because I will play it on my xbox - as if you have no savegame, your previous standard choices are as sh*tty as possible. But I played a LOT of the multiplayer, and despite the amazing gameplay, it is plagued by so many bugs, sometimes you just give up. You will fall from the map, become immortal, enemies will turn invisible, be teleported into the scenario, the server will crash midgame, you get an error when trying to buy things.... For an AAA game that costs 70 Bucks (with the "optional" DLC), this is unforgivable. So disappointed with Bioware.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game featured a promising start. It was exciting to finally see everything you did in the last 2 games make a difference in Mass Effect 3... Only that it didn't. Nothing you did in the game has a result or consequence in this game, not even the stuff you do in Mass Effect 3. You can't do any major choices during the game. The combat feels like a bad version of Gears of War. The ending is horrible and makes the whole story of Shepard from the first game to the third feel irrelevant. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel like I just ate the perfect sub, except the ends were made out of the worst thing you can imagine.First the From Ashes DLC (which isn't DLC it's ULC as in Unlockable Content, since it's already on the disk) which just botched it from the start, then I get into the game and it's awesome, I was engaged so many things I had done in the previous games affected my War Assets which would help me in the end to get a truly fitting ending for Commander John Shepard, we reach earth, the crucible is done, our chances are low but measurable, We already destroyed a Reaper and are ready to launch the final attack to take back the citadel and use it as the catalyst for the crucible to defeat the reapers. And then the Harbinger lands! Finally I get to face down my enemy that haunted me throughout the second third of the epic adventure that is Mass Effect, but we say **** it!" and charge for the catalyst in a suicide run, I felt like I had actually gotten the assets to defeat the harbinger, I had Jack and her bionic artillery, I had that Volar Bombing Fleet and some other assets I can't remember off the top of my head. I accept it, the Crucible is inbound for earth and we really don't have the time to fight the Harbinger as epic as that fight would have been.It's a suicide run, people dying left and right, I can't even see the rest of my 3-man cell of my lovable girlfriend Tali'Zorah nar Rayya vas Normandy and long time friend in arms Garrus Vakarian, I fear that they might have been killed already, but I press on having already lost too many friends to let the reapers win. I'm almost there and I get hit, I can't see. I wake up, body aches, bleeding, my armor is a mess, so is my already scar-riddled face, I get up, with my last strength I destroy the resistance along the last stretch and I board the Citadel. There's dead bodies everywhere, none of them slaves of the reapers, I feel weird, I had helped C-sec setting up defensive turrets, I had organised a Citadel Militia, resistance should have been made, I push on and this is where it all goes to hell, The Ilusive Man, Anderson that somehow made it on board after me but is ahead of me in a linear walkway, the white light as the crucible won't fire. I meet the Catalyst that gives me 2 **** options out of 3 **** options there are, I fullfill my mission, I destroy the reapers dying in the process, and as Commander John Shepard dies and I see the results unfold a bit of myself dies as everything, the preliminary creation of my characters personality (not paragon/renegade but actual character personality creation) saving Garrus as Archangel, Mordin's sacrifice, the technology recovered from the collector base, saving the rachni queen,  getting a fleet, forming an inter-species galaxy-spanning alliance, the largest fleet ever seen, the most unified defence, helping all those people, all those diplomatic relations, sacrificing the geth and killing Legion so the Quarian counter-attack won't get decimated, all those things, and what can i get for it? a little more effort and I would get to see Shepard twitch as he is probably dying of blood loss. Nothing I did meant anything in the end, the entire ending is a hollow gesture, all my time meant nothing in the end. This ending is so horrible that it actually affects my experience of the earlier games... I had so much about gameplay I could think about, there's goods and bad but the only thing that pops up when I think about Mass Effect is that ending. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, I finished ME3 last week and then spent a week in my spare time reading all about the travesty that was the ME3 ending.  Yup, it was beyond awful.  It really killed the entire ME experience for me; yes, all three games; five years; all dead. Here are my thoughtsâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can sum this entire review in three words: f*#k this game. anyway read below for the TLDR

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away. There was a game series known as Mass Effect. This game series was unique in the sense that it told a compelling sci fi story and it let you influence the course of the story through your very own character. You made the decisions, and it was essentially YOUR story. Mass Effect 1 was a smash hit back in 2007, gameplay like this was never done on this level before. Mass Effect 2 was released in 2010 (I think), and it was even better than it's predecessor. Granted the story in Mass Effect 2 was a waste of  time.. however it did develop the characters and that was great and all, but I digress.

In steps the highly anticipated Mass Effect 3, I can't tell you how much freaking HYPE there was for this game it was nuts. It gets released, and at first it's everything ME3 was meant to be, it was the freakin' third installment of the mass effect series. Then you start noticing little things... little shortcuts the devs took that progressively stack up as you play your way through the game. Why are the civilians 2D sprites? Why did they use a poorly photoshopped googled stock photo to reveal a major character? Why did they nullify many important choices that you made throughout the series? Why did they restrict dialogue to only 2 choices 90% of the game? who.. what.. why.. then it hits you, this game was rushed. Good old fashioned EA nonsense if you will. What kind of  is this?? Why it's EA of course, these guys are the MASTERS of  let me tell you. but wait it gets worse. specifically towards the end of the game, during the last 2 or 3 hours or so, the story begins.. well frankly.. to fall apart. Many important plot elements just go completely unexplained, many characters appear in places they shouldn't be with zero explanation at all, large space stations are moved across the galaxy all of a sudden, no explanation at all. but wait, it gets worse! during the final part of the game, the plot starts to look like swiss cheese no joke, disappearing characters, reappearing characters, characters get magic powers all of a sudden. all with zero explanation.

and the cherry on top of this  sunday, and I think you know it... the ending. It honestly can't get much worse than this ending. It makes no god damned sense, it retcons the entire trilogy essentially, it makes you pick your favorite color, and your characters dies in almost all of them. and NONE of your choices mattered. the end. That's seriously the ending, some big red green or blue explosion happens, you either become god of the universe for no reason, turn the galaxy into robots and everyone's happy.. cuz robots are awesome I guess, or shoot a tube and land in a pile of bricks somehow, depends on what your favorite color is. there's also a 4th ending but in this ending, everyone dies the end that's it. Bioware put that ending in JUST TO SPITE ppl that didn't like this trash heap of an ending. Oh don't even get me started on biowarEA's condescending attitude towards this whole situation. They would rather sit back and call everybody a bunch of entitled whiners rather than fix their broke ass game. yeah, that's good customer relations ISN'T IT. They lead people on to believe that something more than meets the eye was going on with this ending, but nope, fooled them again, the ending is just as bad as it looks, nothing more nothing less. If you like it, buy my dlc, if not then EVERYBODY DIES GTFO.. artistic integrity indeed.

anyway, it also comes with multiplayer for some fuc#$%ing reason. Remember what made Mass Effect 1 and 2 great? the multiplayer right? NO THERE WAS NO MULTIPLAYER wtf are these people thinking. this game was never about multiplayer it was about an awesome singleplayer experience, which they effectively destroyed in the last 10 minutes so scratch that. EA strikes back, avoid them at all costs. They'll take your cash.

This game gets a 1/10 because as much as a pile of  it is, there are some genuinely good parts of it, that's the other writers, you know.. the talented people.. doing their thing. I feel really bad for them, having all their work overshadowed by lazy and retarded executive producers and lead writers. The music is really good so I'll give it a 2/10.

Don't buy this game. Don't play this game. Don't let your friends play this game. it will leave a very sour taste in your mouth afterwards, particularly if you're a mass effect fan. nearly destroyed my interest in gaming entirely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioware/EA. Just look at there last few releases and everything that's wrong with them, now add all that onto the fact the series was actually kind of ok, and you have what is akin to.. Say.. A young attractive women who had a wonderful career/life ahead of her, who in one fell swoop, was beaten and raped repeatedly over and over and over until even the dregs of society wouldn't want to touch her with a ten foot poll in case of catching herpes or aids.That's what Mass Effect 3 is like, basically. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Though a great game, the last few moment ruin the entire experience of the entire ME series. Like so many other players, I really enjoyed Mass Effect 3. If not for the last 15 minutes, I would give this game a 9 or more. However, the ending is so abysmal (plot holes, inconsistencies, unsatisfying explanations, not to mention exactly the same whatever you do throughout all three games...) that I can't give this game any more than a 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first 95% of this game is incredible and worth playing. It introduces new characters and themes while (for the most part) successfully wrapping up story lines from the previous two games. Unfortunately the last 10-15 minutes of the game undermine everything that has happened up to that point. All your decisions are rendered meaningless and random plot hole after random plot hole end what up to that point had been one of the greatest games I have ever played. What is most insulting is that the ending feels cheap and tacked on, almost as if the developer ran out of time and resources and just threw some random stuff together hoping no one would notice. This game is not worth buying until the developer removes the glaring plot holes and fixes the ending to reflect the character's choices throughout this game and the previous two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

mass effect was epic.mass effect 2 was powerful.mass effect 3 just kill the trilogy.put 2 point because they are good things in this game but you lose so much with your multi-player who is necessary to the solo and this horrible end! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll admit that the graphics in this game are nice and pretty fluent with the animation, but there's just something that...I don't know; it just...doesn't enthrall me like I thought it would. I've had so many people, along with my boyfriend, tell me "Oh my God, this game is amazing! You need to play it." So, I did. I went over to my boyfriends, fought with his PS4, aaaand gave up not even half way through the game because I was bored. If a game doesn't hold my attention it's not fun. I'm not saying I hate the game, the only game I've ever truly hated was Bioshock Infinite, but I don't really care for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I installed Knights of the Old Republic to find a game that honored Star Wars. I guess I have to keep looking. The combat system is the worst thing I've ever seen in a long, long time. Characters are lame. It's a shame because the plot is great.

By far, one of the worst videogames I've played 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So many faults this game has. Let's look at a few: (1) Two of the three playable character classes are useless. The game really wants you to be a fighter, and helps you along this path by making all the other "skills" (like Demolition, Repair) utterly useless. Too bad it doesn't tell you up front at character creation. (2) The offensive Jedi powers have a 25% chance of success, approx. That is absolutely pathetic. In the time you waste "casting" a spell (ahem, Force Power), you could have done several devastating melee attacks with your lightsabre instead. Tactics? I'm afraid not, this is strictly hack'n'slash. (3) The gameplay is one long clickfest. You use the same attacks in the same sequence on every single foe. Most of the time you just sit back and let the computer play the game itself. (4) Bosses. Completely immune to all Force Powers and status attacks. The final nail in the coffin for me. Just an example of how games haven't progressed from the 1980s. Need a challenging encounter? Make an enemy immune to everything! And that's not all (but enough). If you want a decent Star Wars game, play Jedi Knight - Jedi Outcast, or its sequel Jedi Academy. You'll probably enjoy either of those much more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with all of the points Cainan B made. Also, this game is such an unbelievable drag to play. I tried really hard to like it, but the combat is so unbearably slow, simple and repetitive and the main quest is padded to such a ridiculous extent that it makes you feel as if you're going to go crazy if it doesn't finish soon. I can hardly believe this is a bioware game, and it's annoying to no end that such a patently bad game is getting such good reviews; this kind of sloppy work should not be encouraged under any circumstances. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes, only 3. After all it is star wars... but it is not a good rpg game, it is not a game at all. Flawless graphics... great story... one GREAT problem though... what's the fun in clicking on a target and have the computer do all the fighting? This is a game for children.. I returned it the very next day, in horrid dissapointment. Despicable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a gamer and Star Wars fan... but I hate this game.  The graphics are terrible even for 2003.  No widescreen for example.  The gameplay is boring.  The story is boring and long drawn out.  I couldn't play it more than 3 hours.  I want to like this game, but it just sucks.  Now I can't submit my score with Chrome OR IE.  These are rigged votes 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although unique in it's visual style, this overrated title is a clunker to play. Some reviews have said this game is humourous, but I don't get it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mario Kart Super Circuit feels like a buggy mess and it goes on for 10 cups making it by far the longest and (at least in my opinion) worst Mario Kart game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Am I playing the same game as everyone else? I am? Why's this so overrated?
It feels clunky, the sounds are weird, handling is awkward, what's so amazing about this???
Easily the worst game in the series. People are giving this trash TENS.
I gave this game extra points because it's a Mario Kart game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Motion controlls lag, camera seems to go off into its own little world so you cant even see whats infront of you. Story is average. Gameplay is fun though. The motion controlls are scripted, and they tend to do something completely different then what you wanted it to do. Theres no voice acting, like wtf Nintendo? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off, I wonder how much money Nintendo dished out to sites like IGN and the like to rate this zelda higher than a six? This game is honestly atrocious, and the worst zelda I have ever played. And trust me I've played through about "85% through, master." Yeah, Fi... 85%... whatever you say.... of all the zelda games. Majora's Mask, which any zelda fan can argue, has the craziest, insane, most twisted story in the franchise. Now compare that to Skyward Sword. You have a bland "hero, knight, chivalry, etc." character that hacks n slashes first and asks questions later. You know that mummified dad you had to save in MM with the song of healing? Ya, non-o-dat here.
Speaking of music, what the flip Nintendo?! After Mario galaxy's soundtrack (which i still listen too), you give us uninspired, orchestra (orchestra, has to be good?! Right?!) music which is about as moving as a clogged toilet. The harp? Dear God, just take it away, compared to the beautiful ocarina compositions from OoT and MM, the harp playing sections include a bunch of random phrases composed by pulling notes out of a hat. On top of that, there are no specific songs you learn with the harp, just generic strumming... I still have the Song of Time button input memorized Nintendo, Holy CRAP, gamers have memory spans longer than 1 min!!!
Now Shigeru Miyamoto himself said people stopped playing the game half way through. Well, its not rocket science, how about an actual, interesting story? From what i could gather, by the 30th hour of gameplay, I was merely a lab rat chasing after cheese on an exercise wheel. Zelda is 1 step away! Maybe next time you'll catch her! Oh, can't catch her? How about you do numerous, cloned fetch quests to upgrade your sword and shield in the meantime so you can become god? It was all so predictably written, that it could have been fan fiction. And why is every character so cookie cutter? You have jocks (all of which have a soft side deep down, awww), you have haughty chicks, you have slightly normal people (but always the same), and you have over the top weird. None of them feel tangible or interesting after you learn their 2 paragraphs of background.
The gameplay as everyone says, fails. Sure, some boss battles inspire awe, but only because the baddies are big and interesting. When you're facing moblin after moblin that requires no more skill to defeat than whipping your left hand then whipping your right hand, the gameplay gets stale and that's not mentioning frustrating calibration and aiming issues which happen ALL THE TIME. The overworld,  Skyhaven, Skyhop, i really dont care anymore, has almost nothing to do in it once you have all the money you need, and your wrist will cramp up after flying in Skyhop for more than 5 min. I would rather stroll through my generic neighberhood Walmart.
If you know what Rune Factory Tides of Destiny is... good! You'll get my next reference. Ahem... I finished that game. I didn't finish Skyward Sword. That should make the point loud and clear that SS is the worst excuse for a zelda game ever. Nintendo abused my trust, i used to buy every zelda gaming assured it would appease my adventurous appetite. No more! This was supposed to be the first in the series timeline, well... it comes dead last in my book. Honestly, the younger generation, which apparently has half the brain (according to Nintendo) that I had at the same age, will be the only ones who truly like this game. Many longtime zelda fans and Nintendo fanboys will defend it for the sake of pride, but at the same time, inadvertently cast a shaky look over their shoulders at the shell of what used to be the quality zelda franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun Portrayal of the main characters and passable story, but for something in the action adventure category there us a surprising lack of adventure in the 3 areas you go to which get recycled and rehashed throughout the game. For Pete's sake they flood the forest for the water segment? Did anyone honestly enjoy those design choices? How about the unresponsive controls that most of the people had, and slight lag or these control issues may not seem like an issue but if every basic enemy has a direction based blocking mechanic it makes the fight against them an exercise in futility. So far from the zelda formula it isn't even funny. Beating bosses with the item found in dungeon, only 3 bosses follow that of the listed 16 in the game (on zelda dungeon). Of those 16, 7 of them are slow and clunky sword fights, 3 are fighting imprisoned, 3 are fighting Ghirahim, and 1 of them is Tentalus (boss at the end of the dungeon has nothing to do with the mechanics at all in said dungeon). The combat itself is far from fun, it has you jumping through a hoop for nearly each enemy because most of the time you are left waiting for the hoop to be at the right height to jump through it. Random flailing of the wiimote as you walk into enemies was more effective at taking out the enemies than engaging in combat was. To me that doesn't sound like an effective system, when having no strategy is preferred over actually using the new mechanics, but the things such as motion delay made that impossible so the best method was to literally make your sword unpredictable by flailing to confuse the computer without lock-on to greatly reduce the chance of them blocking it.  Link may be a sword fighter but that isn't what defines his character, his use of a variety of weapons is what makes link such a liking character, becoming a swiss army knife of a character, but this game takes that away. Few item have multiple uses let alone any use given a combat situation and given the new rpg elements introduced are interesting such as crafting or scavenging, but they fall short when the items crafted have such a limited window of use. Don't forget that there is a always dowsing mechanic that tells you where to go, testing your ability to point at the screen instead of actually making you think. Now it was fun seeing more of a relationship between link and zelda, but unfortunately the game did the exact same as tetra from wind waker, upon finding out that they of importance to the plot they immediately lose all sense of character. I did not enjoy my play through of this game nor do I recommend it to people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Easily one of the worst Zeldas I've played, and I've played most of them.

Controls are atrocious, the motion sensing doesn't add anything except frustration. As with the latest DS Zeldas, they are recycling the same gameplay over and over again. I suppose I could say that for most recent Nintendo games  Mario, Zelda, Mario Kart  nothing new or improved in any of them.

Hopefully the new Zelda 3DS game will be better, it really couldn't be worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Kojima decided to go the RE6-Route with this game and threw everything people liked about the series away in order to attract more casuals. The result is pretty much the same here: the absolute down point of the series, congratulations, it can't get worse than this.
After the very hectic intro (which is already the "best" part of the game) you're dropped into a dessert and you soon realize something: MGS 5 doesn't feel one single second like a Metal Gear game. Snakes voice was replaced by some random Hollywood-dude, there are no codec conversations, items need to be selected with an awkward combination of d-pad and the right stick, Snake apparently turned into a vampire, because his injuries magically disappear after a few seconds instead of needing medical treatment etc. All those little details. Boss battles, story and even Snakes personality are practically non-existent. The worst thing, however, is the terrible game design: select a mission, land in the mission area, go from A to B, leave the mission area, rinse and repeat, get bored to death.  Yeah, that's the whole game, open world obviously doesn't work for MGS...
If you actually liked MGS 1-3 or even 2008s Metal Gear Soap Opera (which now seems great in comparison) then MGS5 isn't your game of the year, it's the disappointment of the decade. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will say that the open world concept was novel and was impressively done, but it lent a hand to ruining the game as a whole. Because you are forced into your helicopter between each mission, the game feels entirely disjointed. There is little linear progress through the otherwise impressive world that fans of the series have come to expect. Just as things begin to get interesting, you are presented with a "to be continued" message during a cutscene, then find yourself riding in the helicopter once more, completely pulling the viewer out of whatever immersion they were experiencing. In addition, I found myself wondering what I should be doing next at certain points because there was no story mission available. I then relegated myself to doing side missions until Ocelot tells me I had better get back to base for whatever comes next.

By the time I had completed the game, I simply didn't care about the characters, the story, or to continue with the repetitive nature of the missions. NO spoilers, but the ending of the game was entirely disappointing. It took me a short while to realize that there was in fact no additional content. The story line simply does not resolve itself.

For the enjoyable open world concept, I give 2 points.

For the lack of a compelling story, depth of character, progression in the MG world, broken-up gameplay, non-linearity, and complete lack of an ending, I award it zero (additional) points, and may God have mercy upon it's soul. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

most boring metal gear solid game i ever played.

just because the character moves nicely, doesn't make this a great game.

I want a story that pulls me in a direction just like the first hour!!!

Instead I got a "mission" based game that felt like an mmorpg grind fest.
They did nothing but bore me to death and I felt like I was doing household chores....

This would have been ok as a DLC or something (call it Metal Gear VR). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who has never played an MGS game before, I didn't really know what to expect.  The story line is ridiculous at best.  Why is there such a disconnect with reality and a focal plot in this game?  The invincible supernatural enemies, for instance:  A red head girl in a gas mask wearing a sweater that's 5 sizes too large for her torso, green eyed zombies in gas masks (again the damn gas masks...), or a hulking man made of lava.  This entire subplot makes zero sense, and even after reading up on previous MGS lore, it seems their writing has always been absolutely bonkers and juvenile to begin with.  The gameplay is poorly executed, the world is bland and stale, missions are repetitive and boring.  Each point of interest on the map is loaded with identical assets and enemies.  Stun this guy, kill this guy, click this objective, rinse and repeat.  I seriously do not understand the reasoning behind this game's score.  I'm all about open world games (The Witcher 3, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, etc.), but this is a joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought The Phantom Pain expecting a rich and engaging single player experience with a cohesive and cinematic level of storytelling. Instead MGS V feels like a disjointed and lost effort at some sort of open world RPG. The two environments are forgettable like the developers bought a whole bunch of prefabricated objects and terrain elements from the Unity engine store and tried to build a game around it. The 'missions' feel completely repetitive, especially because each one starts with the opening credits again like the game is reminding you that the last mission seemed to have nothing to do with the next mission. It's a grind to get anywhere rewarding in the game and I gave up on it pretty quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so overrated. Its not even close to being a masterpiece.
- Little to no story
- Mediocre graphics
- Very repetitve gameplay
-Bad ending
This game is overhyped garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First and foremost I will award the game 2 points for the great performance(for the most part) of the game on consoles. However, there are still stuttering issues at times during the game, which require a hard reboot of the console to correct. This game's story has to be one of the worst I've heard in years and there's not even a satisfying conclusion to it all liked you'd expect from the final Kojima Metal Gear Solid game. And this is a huge problem because it makes the game feel unfinished when you combine that with the fact that Chapter 2 is just you replaying the same missions you already played on a higher difficulty. The games gives you a decent amount of options, but the actual level design doesn't encourage you to stray from the norm and try new things unless you just spam headshots over and over because then soldiers will start wearing helmets. The open world is barebones, lifeless and dull as well as a chore to travel with mountains that exist for no other reason, but pure padding and to impede your way. On top of there is no variety in the environments that you encounter in the game apart from the prologue, which strips all control from the user and is overlong anyway. This would be okay if the environments in the game were actually interesting like with previous Metal Gear games, however MGSV's depictions of Africa and Afghanistan are as uninteresting as can be, which is absurd(especially in Africa) considering the amount of landmarks and variations it has. MGSV reminds me of a 3rd person Far Cry 4, but with better mechanics, an even worse world and even more repetitive side missions. Both games can be "fun" for a time, but you'll end  up with a very bad taste in your month after a while and especially once you're done and reflect on what you've done in the game. The side ops are a joke, have no context and recycle the same areas and objectives from the main game. My advice if you must play this nonsense is to wait for a sale so you're not as disappointed in your purchase as I was. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game controls and mechanics are terrible. Physics engine goes haywire. Half of missions and nearly all side ops are replays. Upgrading takes too long. Seeing credits every beginnings and endings of all missions is boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Apparently, after DA2 and TORtanic, BioWare have now pinched-out another classic game, enhanced with Day-1 DLC, linear gameplay, ORIGIN for the PC, and a tripartite ending choice that makes many gamers, after having invested dozens upon dozens of hours of gameplay with the franchise, want to commit hari kiri. . . .   Apparently, eschewing much player-choice in this latest sequel to the MASS EFFECT series, BioWare have included their "awesome-button" with this dreck, which might be better named MASS APPEAL 3, due to limited exploration, near-complete disregard for historical player-choice and odd design implementation.  Aside from some XBOX technical guffaws, such as my femShep falling through the world during the Tuchanka Eve series with the Hammer activations, extensive plot-changing cutscenes with minimal player-input have derailed a MASS EFFECT series that was originally a player-driven RPG and not a combat-heavy, awesome-button homage to stilted dialogue choices with nearly-identical outcomes.  How BioWare's continuity department envisioned MASS EFFECT 3's wrangling with philosophical, social and moral issues such as implied xenophobia, homosexuality, interspecies coupling and the biological-species-rule, while omitting or ignoring coherent closure with a myriad of player-driven endings is mind-numbing.  Simply put, it is apparent that more design and interplay have been woven into the story arc regarding Shepard's "top or bottom" status than the ending of the entire trilogy.  In other words, BioWare had the will, the time and energy to craft homosexual plot threads and allude to interspecies sexual trysts throughout the subtext of MASS EFFECT but could NOT be bothered to make any ending that had consistency with lore, player-choice, the intrinsic MASS EFFECT experience?   This following observation might be simplistic; BUT, what kind of DLC should I buy for a universe that no LONGER EXISTS?   -In other words, shall I play the game AGAIN and see if it turns out any differently?    /facepalm. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If it were a stand alone, this game would be pretty good. If you've played through from the beginning at least once (about 60 hours just to get to ME3) this game will be a massive disappointment. Until the last ten minutes it is one of the greatest games I have ever paid. From then on it robs you of any significant choice, throws out years of great writing for over-done cliches piled upon each other and less of a playback of an investment than when Fallout 3 first came out. I have spared three of my friends the let down of this game, and would do so for you the reader. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The ending is so bad that it almost ruins the previous games. Thank you Bioware for all your empty promises. The choices you make through out the series, really don't matter at all you'll get the same ending. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you like Lost TV show you will love this game. If you hate Lost or Alias for its contrived ambiguous ending and if you think J. J. Abrams or Hollywood as a whole plays the viewers for a fool you will dislike this game. ME3 is a low quality game if you care about story and think your choices in all 3 ME games will matter and determine the game's ending. They won't. Your choices will not change the adventure. You will not meet your love interest, Shepard will die except one ending, galactic civilization will always collapse, Normandy will crash on an unknown planet, no FTL travel will be available, Shepard won't meet the squad or Normandy crew. Aside from that cinematic cutscenes and voice acting are top notch. But dialogs are cliche and full of Hollywood crap. The game is juvenile, not mature. It is also over dramatic and melodramatic. Gameplay is good, action is good but combat mechanics are clumsy because you use the same button nearly for everything. There is no happy ending, but actually there is no ending. You do not know anything about the fate of the galaxy when you hit the end. Crew members and squad's fate are also unknown. Bioware had promised that our choices made in this game and prequels would matter but they don't. You don't get any resolution. Game suddenly ends. Bioware wanted to appeal Call of Duty FPS fans. They don't care about RPG genre or older fans. They think that old people go but there are always teenagers to fool with shocking content. They thought that FPS fans won't care about story so making a bad ending and destroying Mass Effect campaign setting is good because it will allow them to create a dumbed down brainwashed ME MMORPG like the SWTOR. Ambiguous endings will allow an open ended MMORPG where developers and writers don't commit anything. Endings are ambiguous because 1 they want to please everybody so they cannot make a definite choice or ending and 2 shocking endings will appeal to script/plot poor people. Beta leak had better endings like ME2. There you could save your team if you did everything right. But here you die even if you do everything right. ME3 lead writer Mac Walters says journey is everything and destination is nothing. This is the typical volunteered mass consumption slave brainwash and whitewash behavior and an ill attempt of damage control. The contrived endings are probably dictated by Bioware or EA executives at the last moment. Because Lost TV show like endings are very cost effective and since they are not conclusive the producer company can create a totally different sequel which has nothing to do with the original Mass Effect premise but having the same name for branding purposes. So to summarize if you like Lost TV show you will love this game, if you hated Lost for playing the audience for a fool you will probably not like Mass Effect 3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is pretty poor with massive plot holes and bioware completely raping the lore of mass effect im pretty pissed at  this game. forced relationships horrible bloody ending to a series that really had potential. bioware are a shell of there former selves most of the talent left years ago. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioware has made a terrible game. Choices from previous games don't matter. Lets see the endings go from bad to absolutely terrible, so much for being an open ended game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioware's shot for a wider audience backfired tremendously. They focused to much about making a story-centric game, only to have the story, the dialogue and especially the ending be absolutely terrible, derivative and at times, off-the-wall nonsensical, from a writer's standpoint. Graphics are barely above the 2nd installment, gameplay is a mix between the first and the second, cutscenes absolutely everywhere and absolutely no sense of accomplishment by finishing the game. Couple that with day 1 DLCs and Origin's requirements and you've got the blunder of the year right here. Would not recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Repetition, repetition, repetition, talking, talking, talking, cut scene, wonky gun fight, cut scene, rinse and repeat. Save your money and buy Mass Effect 2 for a third the price! ME3 is practically the exact same game as ME2, besides the new online multiplayer "horde mode", but even this new multiplayer mode loses it's appeal quick, and i mean QUICK. Wait for ME3 to drop in price, or run out and buy ME2 used. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Subpar all the way, the boys and girls at Bioware went out to the back shed and slapped this garbage together in their spare time. Instead of investing time and effort into making it a great RPG they tried to make it a shooter, an RPG and a movie to widen its appeal and give them more money. In places ME3 has its moments, but they are few are far between, the graphics are nothing to get excited about, the plot detached and the choices you can make have little or no overall impact regardless of play mode. They have forgotten thier roots and the established lore of thier own game. I would rather pay for and be forced to read all of the twilight novels than play this dreadful game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mass Effect has been an amazing series with great storytelling and excellent characters. So I'm dumbfounded with the way Bioware decided to end it all with absolutely no closure and plot holes galore. We didn't need a happy "rainbows and bunnies" ending - just one that makes sense and provides closure. Maybe we the fans don't deserve better - but Mass Effect sure did. For me, the horrible ending ruined the series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All forms of narrative storytelling (whether it be books, movies, or video games) are judged on the beginning of the narrative and the conclusion of it. With that being said, Mass Effect 3 is a great game until you reach the lackluster ending. When a company such as Bioware creates a game that takes pride in its extraordinary writing, issues with the story are huge because we, the consumers, expect the best from Bioware. This awful set of ending scenarios is probably another money milking tactic of EA's in order to squeeze more money out of the Mass Effect IP, whether it be in the form of DLC or future sequels (Bioware has already stated that even though Shepard's story is over, the Mass Effect IP may continue in the future).It's entirely possible that this series of ending scenarios was made in order to make the writing process for the next trilogy of ME easier, which I hope was the case because apparently they downgraded in that regard. Mass Effect 3 is rather enjoyable except for the last 30 minutes, with that being said, if you prefer to play video games with strong narratives, this game isn't for you. The ending has many plot holes which are not explained and any questions that were to be answered from previous installments were just replaced with new ones (most likely to garner interest in future titles).One last note; there are a lot of reviewers here who believe that those who are giving low scores are ignorant or that it's merely a bunch of "trolls". The truth is that this franchise was harmed in the worst way when these terrible endings were implemented. The truth is that for most of the negative reviews (not all of them, but most) there is a player who was expecting an epic conclusion to an epic saga, but was left with a deep feeling of betrayal and disappointment due to a tragic ending of a great trilogy (I do not mind sad endings, by tragic ending I mean an ending of poor taste). I'm not sure if I'm going to buy ME4 (I definitely will not buy it on its day of release, so I can wait to see the reviews before purchasing it) but if they do plan to continue the franchise, I hope they carry it out in a careful manner and return to the roots that made Mass Effect 1 such a great video game. I'm sure those who are loyal to the franchise will agree with me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great series and concluding story up until the last 10 minutes, disappointing enough to tarnish the rest of the series as well. What does the game do different than the previous titles? The action has even more fit and finish and is an absolute blast, some customization to weapons is given but a better variety of mods would have been welcomed. Voice acting is great (except for some odd journalist person out of nowhere with a nightmarish outfit) and the story will pluck your heartstrings. Quest tracking is awful, embarrassingly awful when you are unable to view your inventory for a quest item and the quest tracker provides no clue as to whether you've picked it up or not. This might no be an issue if you play this parts in large block of time but if you are taking frequent breaks between these side missions it is hard to keep track of that else you need to do before you return tot he hub. Also there is no announcement of time limited windows for completing side quests, I found out when I saw  them disappear and forced me to load a previous save. To sum this up, the game is great, I would have appreciated more dialog conversations but it wasn't a deal breaking....until the end. I don't think this ending is sad, or depressing. It's just bad, cheapens the rest of the story and the universe the game is set in. If this is your first Mass Effect game I don't think the reaction will be as terrible, but if you've fallen in the love with the characters and story, beware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the ending really kills the series as a whole. i wanted a better ending to my shepard. too many plot holes. they dont even tell you what happens with yur squadmates, and all the characters you came to love. we played 3 games 100 hours plus on each shep story and this is how you end it for us? sad sad sad :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game featured a promising start. It was exciting to finally see everything you did in the last 2 games make a difference in Mass Effect 3... Only that it didn't. Nothing you did in the game has a result or consequence in this game, not even the stuff you do in Mass Effect 3. You can't do any major choices during the game. The combat feels like a bad version of Gears of War. The ending is horrible and makes the whole story of Shepard from the first game to the third feel irrelevant. The games has lots of glitches and feels rushed and unpolished. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked the first installment pretty well; and the second STILL stands as one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I've had; it showed remarkable improvements from the first in terms of character (richer back-stories, more dialogue), better pacing (no endless roams on the dune-buggy, the mining was maybe tedious but brief), and streamlined game-play (shooting, squad orders; no wonky upgrades/menus).  This installment started out ... amiss. By the time I reached Rannoch and attempted FAR TOO MANY TIMES to dispatch the Reaper on even the easiest setting (only doing so as a last and final resort, and dying my first two and final attempts barely getting a shot off). So I've quit. I don't know what else to say about it that hasn't already been said. I DO HOPE that EA/Bioware etc. take the time to carefully look into the feedback they've gotten from the fans regarding this franchise and take it to heart... somehow that seems a bit futile too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is Mass Effect 2 but with a less interesting story and atmosphere. The dialogue is less intense in this "brighter" conclusion and the character development is simply chaotic. Gatherings forces ultimately doesn't effect the outcome, and your previous game choices that you have saved from two games now end up not mattering at all. The multiplayer is just a horde/zombie type grind with no real interesting mechanics. When I heard co-op where you played a new squad I figured there would be a short side story where your play parallel to the campaign story, but nope. The only good thing was that they added more rpg features when it comes to character skills and customization. All in all, it is a boring conclusion for a nearly perfect series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A huge disappointment. The game was clearly put together in a rush and EA made it blatantly obvious, if you have been following the Mass Effect series since the first game then you will know that it is a very well written space drama that got you immersed within the first hour of playing the first 2 games yet whilst playing Mass Effect 3 the immersion was destroyed on numerous occasions by various mistakes e.g. sprites that have been placed that have no reason for being there and on one occasion a sprite that just walked around in circles.

I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone as I know it is a poorly made third-person and its bad enough to make fans of the previous games cry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not sure how Mass Effect 3 received as much acclaim as it did. It looked liked this game was created by a bunch of Gears of War developers working a second job. The writing was even worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not going to be like alot of people and sugar coat anything.  I rated this game fairly low compared to the first two in the series for multiple reasons which will be described here.  The game plays just like Mass Effect 2 with an upgraded melee system which isn't a bad thing.  Second thing, which is why I didn't rate the game entirely horrid, is the level system changes.  Instead of straight skills you no have more choices in how your skills level, if they inflict higher damage or last longer or even have a larger radius.  Now on to the part I'm sure most have heard by now but if like me was still hopeful was wrong.  Apparently there are multiple endings to the game, but from what I've seen NOTHING you've done in the game or previous others makes a difference, aside from finishing the crucible.  At the end of the game no matter how big of a galactic fleet you've acquired, who you have on your side, the side quests you've finished, who lived in part 1 and 2, you're put with 2 choices(from what I've heard pre update was 3) the choices are destroy ALL mechancal life including yourself, or kill yourself and take control of the reapers.   Yes in the previous two games the choices are kind of an illusion, that don't have a direct impact, but in this game the choices have no impact.  I don't mind them killing off you're character, ending the series, just so they can't pull a Halo, but it would have been nice to have a game where you can win with a third choice of killing the reapers using your own fleet, since apparently all the reapers moved to earth.  The second choice for the ending of taking over the reapers is a mind rape to me because apparently you become the Catalyst which was you're objective to find the entire game, and in doing so remain sentient on The Citadel, yet no one can speak to you or know you're there after that.  The issue here is that the original Catalyst, the creator of the reapers, is speaking to you, giving you your two choices.  So it telling me that I become it yet can't communicate like it does was a huge let down.  Aside from this there are several other major things that could have been an ending to the game that would have worked, part 2 and 3 never happened I'll list them here...  The first is part 2 and 3 never happened, at the end of part 3 you awaken after being saved from dying in space from the Collector attack on the normandy in part 2.  Second is similar but instead of part 2 also being a dream only part 3 is and you awake in a reaper controlled facility and part 3 is an attempt to Indoctrinate Shephard.  Third is this game is a dream that you're having while the Alliance tries to figure out how Cerebus rebuilt you in part two.

All this being said, Bioware really dropped the ball with this game, which honestly seems to have become a forte of the company with their games,  see Dragon Age origins, and dragon age 2.

Gay ass game I regret buying it. Will pirate it 30 times to damage EA.This is my last EA Game, Battlefield 3 sucked so hard man I can't believe they can get money with this even CoD was better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a waste of a good series. This game is just simply terrible. Sprites and stock photos in a AAA game? Thats unforgivable. however the nail in the coffin for me was the fact that none of your choices matter at all. Massive disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game was perfect... until the last 10 minutes. The combat was awesome, the set pieces were great, war was burning the galaxy. Shepard's decisions were supposed to doom or save the galaxy. Fast forward to the end: you only get 3 endings, the endings have huge plot holes, and turn off the game with immense rage. This game's ending is an abomination compared to the rest of the series (including the rest of ME3). The ending is so bad that I still have to give a score of 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this game probably had the worst ending ever.  I am not going to give any specifics, but it will be the same no matter what you have done throughout the last two games.  The choices you make in this game are also pointless. The futility of choices is somewhat apparent during the game because you only have two options the whole time (paragon is always on top and renegade is always on bottom).  However, this does not even come close to the nut punch that is the end.   I am in no way joking when I say I almost laughed at how bad the ending was.   It is apparent that they had no idea how to deal with all the possible choices so they create a deus ex machina that makes it easy for them.  Given my disappointment with this game, I am unlikely to ever purchase one of BioWare's games again.    This is truly sad because I loved the first two games.I will admit that I thought the gameplay was good and the ride was pretty damn fun, but that is essentially negated by the cop-out ending.   The game also had several surprising bugs and there were lots of skips during the cinematics (which the game is full of).   Aside from the atrociously bad ending, the game suffers from many other instances of terrible writing.  This really makes me think the game must have been rushed b/c I loved the story in previous entries.  It could be because much of the story is borrowed from science fiction books I like and the writers didn't know what to do when they had to figure out something for themselves, but I am just going to assume they were rushed.   If you played the previous mass effects this will likely be one of the biggest disappointments imaginable.  If you did not, you will probably not be bothered that much 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's behind the puzzling endings for such a great game series. Were they artificially trying to make people feel from their game? Were they trying to keep any new games from being made with the same characters? I am not a bot. I am not a EA hater. I am not part of some vast conspiracy. I just hate the endings. If they would fix the endings. I would change my score. But they wont and i wont. It deserves a 8 it gets a 2 for such really stupid endings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm reviewing this right after finishing so this may be overly influenced by the ending. Nonetheless, 3 games worth of choices and storytelling were tossed out the window in the final minutes leaving me with a severely bad impression. I don't mind the tone or the darkness. I do mind that it felt like, for the ending, a different group of writers were brought in, given a two-sentence plot summary and told that resources were limited so they should cut as many corners as possible.Up until then, I was planning on going back on playing through all three again to see the results of different paths. After I played through the 3 alternate endings thinking I must have just picked the wrong one the first time, I was so annoyed that I just uninstalled it.For a game in which the consequences of choices have had real in-game (and emotional) impacts up to that point, to have the ending completely disconnected from any choices you made is ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

just wtf were they thinking? where are shepherd's emotions for his dying "friends," and why are previous decisions just glazed over and ignored? even putting those big issues aside, the ending was one of the most disappointing pieces of garbage I have ever witnessed. you go through 3 games, 5 years total playing this trilogy and you are given 3 choices? what was the point of all those other choices that were posed as "big deals," when they don't even come into play at the end? never mind how screwed everyone is at the end, the ending choices themselves end up screwing everyone or taking away from their autonomy as sapient beings one way or another! How did a game series so good just down right destroy their reputation in one fell swoop? Then there are the plot holes. I won't spoil anything too badly here, but if you have played the game then you know that there are irreconcilable problems with many aspects of the ending. these writers need to go through some kind of common sense seminar or something because this is unacceptable. My recommendation to anyone who has not bought the game is to wait and see if there are any worthwhile dlc's that come out in the future, otherwise you will be angry as a guy who was just sold a turd in the guise of a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While I did enjoy most of Mass Effect 3, there are several issues that I found quite disappointing and has left a severely bad after taste in my mouth. First of all, the move from even further away from its RPG roots. For example, the dumbing down of dialogue. The middle ground options seem to have just been completely removed, only providing you a top or bottom choice most of the time. Next, is the lack of exploration. The only place to go to talk to people, a RPG "city" as you will, is the Citadel. Other than that, its pretty much run and gun.The other issue I had with it is the day 1 DLC. It is obvious this character was never meant to leave the game. He provides key story information about the previous cycle, why the markers exist, the reapers, and the fate of the Protheans.My by far most unforgiving issue and biggest disappointment with the game are the endings. The last 10 minutes of the game introduce a brand new character, creates massive plot holes, provide zero closure to anything you've done, have no way to challenge the new end game character's ridiculously insane logic, and have each ending 98% the same as the others. In addition, no matter what choice you make throughout the entire saga, it will have no effect on the end sequence. You will not get any cut-scenes or any form of text explaining how your choices effected the galaxy or what happens to any of your squad mates. Every Shepard will receive the exact same set of endings regardless of what you do. The only factor that plays any roll on the ending is the "effective military strength". Overall, I found the endings to be so empty, depressingly unsatisfying, and poorly written that they have ruined the entire series. Being a long time Mass Effect fan since the first, I wanted to play from the beginning again, but after seeing and knowing what awaits me at the end of 3, I can't even look at it.As I said in the beginning, I did still enjoy most of Mass Effect 3 and could look past its step back from its RPG roots still. Excluding the endings, rating it based soley off the journey up to the end point, i would give the game a 9/10. However, the endings are simply story telling suicide that are so bad they tarnish the entire series greatness. Due to that factor, I give the game overall a 2/10 for the amount of damage the endings do to the franchise along with the depressingly bad after taste it leaves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your choices don't matter as the game pretty much only has one ending. This is terrible for the concluding game in a trilogy. How is it that the developers can market a game as being based in a world that responds to your decisions then pull this stuff! Rent before you buy or just plain rent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ultimately no matter what path was chosen, what actions were taken, who lived and who died, at the end of this journey, all that remains is your ship and your crew abandon you. The first 95% of the game is amazing, its everything I hoped for and more. The last 5% is the biggest slap in the face imaginable. If you have invested 100's of hours from the first game until this one, you will be left stunned and appalled that none of the choices you made, none of the battles you fought, nothing you did in those 100's of hours ultimately pays off in any of the three endings you can pick from. With the three endings and the DLC on day 1, EA/Bioware show that fan support means nothing more than a dollar symbol to them. While most of the joy lays in the journey to the end of the game, there is no replay value at all in this game, because no matter what journey you take, the ends are all ultimately the same except for color variations and if synthetics live or die. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The last 20 minutes of the game appear as brought over from another game; without any logic or closure. A typical deus ex machina with 3 arbitrary choices, and missing is the logical expected one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ME3 is the sad end of a great series.  And I don't mean the now-infamous ending of the final Mass Effect game.  I mean a series of games from Baldur's Gate, to KotOR, to the first two installments of the Mass Effect trilogy..  I mean the end of BioWare's run as the pre-eminent storyteller in electronic gaming.  Many Metacritic users have written fantastic ME3 negative reviews, so I'm not going to elaborate on those.  I recommend traveler's review dated March 29, 2012; it's one of the best examples I've seen.  My bottom line: ME3 was destroyed by a Reaper--not Harbinger, but Whoremonger.  Whoremonger, who has no passion for story or character.  I mean Whoremonger the Money Whore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to review a game in my 28 years of gaming. I have played Mass Effect 1 and enjoyed it so much that I refused to trade it. I played Mass Effect 2, multiple times and I kept that one as well. I spent a lot of time working on my character, making the choices, really defining my experience, so I happily purchase my Mass Effect 3. I love the game until the last ten or fifteen minutes. When the ending comes, it is not the disappointment of this series that is over, or joy that my characters journey is complete. It is of course the  emptiness that every choice i made in the other games did not matter. I played all the side quests offered, even tried the day one dlc to see if that would make a difference. No... This ending is bad, the three choices offered are horrible. If I had known it would have ended like this, I would never have purchased it or wasted my time in such a manner. I tried changing several variables in the story...to no avail. I don't think I have ever been so let down by an entertainment medium since probably the  Star Wars prequels or the Matrix in film. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Waiting for the finale to the epic trilogy that is mass effect was agonizing. All the choices and hours invested over the past two games (and 5 years) were promised to carry over to the final game in a summation of our actions, good and bad, leading up to this point. This promise was completely broken as the ending played out and the obvious disregard for said promise was thrown out the window. Instead, you are presented with three choices that are all entirely too similar, rife with plot holes and inconsistencies that would make the Bush administration blush. Major decisions throughout the series were ignored, leaving the player to have no real reason to agonize over the decisions in the first place. We are not entitled, whiny gamers, but simply gamers disappointed with a promise that was not kept. Bioware, make it right. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The last 15 minutes negates the previous +90 hours worth of gameplay.  It's worse than a mediocre game, it invalidates all of the franchise.  Proceed with caution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had purchased Mass Effect 1 and 2 in addition to all the DLCs because the games were very good. The first one focused on the ME universe while the second focused more on your squad. They each had teething problems, but they were well done.ME3 had some great scenes such as the Genophage issue between the Krogan and the Salarians as well as the Geth and Qurian conflict, however, after that it seemed to fall apart. It was if two different writing teams were involved. Bioware was pushing this whole idea about take back Earth, instead it was just a straight run with waves of enemies. If you felt you were going to make the tough decisions such as the ME2 sUicide mission, it doesnt even come close. You would think that all the decisions made previously, the major conflict resolution such as the Geth and krogans and the war assets would make an impact at the end. Nope, nothing they are counted as war assets which remain at 50% unless you play the coop multiplayer. They are counted as points and you don't see anything of them, except for the Krogan at the end for a brief cameo. Of course, don't get me started about the ending which Bioware lied about, essentially saying the end will be different and we won't give you a choice A,b or C, when in fact they do, instead they are red, green and blue.I could go on, but I am sure by now, you will see the gist of it. I canal understand people who say they played the entire game including the ending, they cannot say that it was rushed or just a complete mess.

Mass Effect Trilogy

Explained with the help of a bunch of apples.

Imagine if i had one apple, this represnts mass effect 1, its all gravy but its clear it could get better.
Imagine if i had two apples, this represents mass effect 2, its made some great improvements and despite some unvaried level design its a great game.
Now imagine if i gave you no apples and TOOK A **** ON YOUR FACE.

This represents mass effect 3, it actually manages to destroy what made it successfull ala modern warfare 3.
How a team of people actually **** up so MONUMENTALLY, is beyond me.

In fact its simple there target market has become wider than a hookers oriface and also as ****ING FILTHY AS ONE. DAY ONE DLC, NO CHOICES, EVERYTHINGS ****ING IRRELIVENT, CANNON PLOT,CANNON ROMANCES, SPACE BROKEBACK ****ING MOUNTAIN, AUTO **** IN MY FACE DIALOGUE, THE CAST FROM JERSEY ****ING SHORE, GEARS OF WARS HORD MODE.

IF YOU ACTUALLY SQUINT ALL THE WAY THROUGH ITS KIND OF LIKE A SPACE BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN GEARS OF WHORES.

YOU FOOL ME ONCE SHAME ON YOU.
YOU FOOL ME TWICE SHAME ON ME.

THIS YEAR HAS MADE ME REALISE THAT COD FRANCHISE AND BIOWARE IN GENERALLY AFTER ****ING UP TO MAJOR FRANCHISES, ITLL BE THREE SOON WHEN THEY PUT PINK ****ING ARMY MEN IN COMMAND AND **** YOURSELF. THEY CAN ALL SUCK MY RINGO STAR. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish that the company had been as loyal to the fans as I have been to the series. After all of the gameplay and all of the care I took playing and replaying the first two games, all I get are three crappy choises that all amount to basically the same thing? I won't be wasting any more money or time with Bioware games if they think this is acceptable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!As a prelude, let me just say that I'm a writer, and I make my living writing. I've been a writer since long before Mass Effect came out, and that's a huge part of what drew me to these games. What I loved about the ME series was how masterfully the story was woven in such a way that the authors (Bioware) crafted a tale that actually permitted input from the readers (gamers) to determine how the story progressed. No matter what path you chose, the story was interesting and engaging, but your decisions always had clear consequences in the end, as the decisions of any protagonist should.Coming into ME3, I was a little nervous. After all, with the bar being set so high with the other two, could Bioware really deliver a fitting conclusion? I mentally prepared myself for the worst. But then, as I played through the game, my fears were gradually alleviated. Frankly, the experience was Epic with a capital E. I saw how the decisions my character had made in the previous games impacted the galaxy around him. The characters came to life and drew pure emotional responses from me as the plot continued to weave itself together. But the arc of the story was clear: Shepard was not going to survive. I was okay with that, and I was ready for that. And playing through the final mission on Earth, having final conversations with all of Shep's squadmates, the writer in me was satisfied. All the loose ends seemed to be tied up. The ending was in sight, it was just a matter of seeing what exactly would happen.I'll spare you the details, but in the last 5 minutes of what had essentially been a hundred hours (or more) of story, that story was destroyed. The sad thing is that the story all made sense, it all fit, except for that last 5 minutes. From the perspective of a player, I failed to accomplish my mission. To quote Ecclesiastes, it was all vanity and grasping after the wind. From a writer's perspective, it's like I crafted a beautifully written and engaging trilogy of novels, but made someone else who didn't know the story or care about the characters write the last paragraph of the last book.As I played through the game, I kept thinking: "This is how video games should be." Now, seeing the end, all I can ponder is what could have been. It was so close to being perfect! But it all unraveled in 5 minutes, FIVE minutes! I didn't want a "happy" ending where Shep lives and has kids and blah-blah-blah (although the option would have been nice, admittedly), I just wanted an ending that kept in step with the series and made sense to a reasonable person. But none of the "endings" meet those criteria. It's just that simple, and just that disappointing.The endings as they are, if accepted in a straightforward manner, are so nonsensical that anything, even a hallucination or even the Reapers winning, would be more fitting. At the very least I hope Bioware will own up to how mercileslly they butchered the end of such a great story. The optimist in me dares to hope that they actually do something about it; it would not be the first time a game was significantly changed with a patch, or that a game's ending was changed with a DLC pack. No one is going to forget the feeling of being betrayed by the end of ME3, but it would go a long way towards healing those wounds if Bioware would try to make things right somehow.As a writer, I understand the argument that the creator of a story has the right to determine the ending as they see fit. And I think it's valid. But even in the realm of printed fiction, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle "changed his story" and brought back Sherlock Holmes after the public outcry at the character's death. Even in the realm of literature, there's room for an author here and there to admit they were wrong and change their tune. I earnestly hope Bioware decides to do the same. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the most depressed I have ever felt after playing a video game.  I must say I am seriously disappointed with the ending; it's as bad as Deus Ex: Human revolution.I was still playing through the game when news of the metacritic review bomb came out. At the time I thought that people were being unreasonable. But now I understand the anger and disappointment being expressed.The ending soured the entire experience, to the point where it's the only thing I can think about when asked to give my opinion of the game.This will be the first bioware game I don't immediately replay in order to see what happens with different choices. It's an enjoyable game, but not one I will play to the end again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game was absolutely perfect, until the ending. With that ending, they essentially negated every decision you've ever made on any of the three games. Your choices became ultimately pointless. The ending not only didn't make any logical sense, it also contradicted that Bioware promised they'd deliver on the game. There is NOT 16 endings. There are 3 endings. Even that is a generous approximation, more like there is one ending with three different versions. If Mass Effect 3 was a standalone game, then this wouldn't be an issue. Sadly, it isn't. This is a colossal disappointment of an ending to a trilogy that garnered critical acclaim from fans and critics alike. The current ending ruins the entire trilogy. No, I'm not being melodramatic. Mass Effect is about choices, and Casey Hudson has even personally claimed that Shepard (aka, the player) decides the story, thus, there is no canon. However, this is entirely contradicted by the end of Mass Effect 3, there is no choice, no closure and no real 'ending' in the full sense of the term. More questions are raised than answers, there's innumerable plotholes and definite pilfering from other games. The game itself is absolutely incredible, let there be no doubt. UNTIL the ending which essentially brushes the entire series that predicates it aside. Disappointing from Bioware. I, for one, expected better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ugh, where to begin.day 1 dlc with its 2012 and it looks like a launch title for the 360characters are extremely one dimensional, and never show any sign of developmentall choice in the game was between red or blue text in a convowell at least the series is over, and they can't hype it up more.  although I'm sure they will find a way to milk this IP for years to come. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mass Effect 3 was a wild ride but the ending was like punch my (Krogan) quads.   I feel utterly betrayed there was no player choice taken into account with the ending.  All 16 endings were just a variation on a theme anyhow.  The ending boils down to a red/blue/green selection.  Don't believe me, check Youtube. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Been a fan since the first article I read about mass effect 7 years ago. What a disappointment. ME3 has been dumbed down from the great rpg it was. I will agree that the combat is tight and smooth, but thats not the main reason why I chose to play it, even after I started to hear the ugly rumors. Had to find out for myself. "Official" reviews sing praise after praise, even while the fan base has spoken very loudly of their displeasure.  I couldn't agree more, after playing through myself. I don't even want to go into what I thought about the ending. I honestly feel ripped off. Now I see bioware tap-dancing and trying to put a positive spin on a turd, while condemning people's criticisms. Chalk one up for EA. You got my 50 bucks and could care less. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

wow EA just wow ever since you bought bioware they havent made anything great the mass effect games were ok but the ending..... is "special" nothing changes in the ending except Colors WOW! Also jennifer hepler I would like to blame YOU for this travesty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, let me say: this is not about the ending...  ... ...oh who the hell am I trying to fool? This is ALL about the ending :) But I will put it in a way that most of the web seems to avoid: like it being something to feel shameful. There is no happy ending. Even picking the "right choices". Even playing for the best. Even spending hours and hours to complete any possible aspect of the game, it is going to end badly. For lots of people (for me of course, I think for many others, and I suspect for a lot of those lamenting for so many rational reasons) it is important to have a chance to make the story "go right". The good wins, the bad sucks, now let's kiss the girl in the sunset and YAY! I can understand all the babbling about "artistic choice" "moral dilemma" "heroic sacrifice" and I can understand that many like them, but I think that after five years, three games and hundreds of hours spent playing, It is hard to chew up, for any of those scorned by the writers choices. This game could have been something epic, making all of the players happy (weel, most of them, let's say); something like the ending of the first Knights of the old republic with a wide variety of possible storylines, After all this is meant as a saga ending: no need for a common point from where to make the story go on. This could have been the "own" ending of every player for how he chose to play the game. Nothing against an indication of that which the authors considered the "true" ending for artistic purposes (or even for a sequel) but respect for any way of playing or feeling the storyline.Unfortunately, it has proven to be quite the opposite: they unbelievably matched the (harder I think) result  to make any kind of player unhappy about what was going on. Nice shot, nothing to say 'bout it ;)The romantic happy ending lovers like me are angry for seeing all we "fought" for collapsed.Those interested in gameplay are angry for an anticlimax final fight, with a tedious dramatic walk (which could have been interesting, wouldn't it be so boring...) and... well... no final fight at all...Those interested in the story are angry for a turnaround of events almost senseless... (uh? the point of the story was the relation between biological being and machines? WAIT, you never mentioned it before... AND We already solved it a minute ago making peace between Geth and Quarians AND... this is Battlestar Galactica's ending too, isn't it a bit redundant?)I could go on fa a while but it is better to stop here: I enjoied playing the saga, but how it turned out made me feel so  that the memory I have when I think of the trilogy is no more "ehy it was fun-tastic"... it is "meh, the poor Shepard, so saaaad".  I think my point of view is pretty clear right now:.GIMME BACK MY DAMN HAPPY ENDING AND QUIT THIS CRAP ABOUT EVERYTHING, FOR BEING APPEALED "ARTISTIC" NEEDING TO BE AN OCEAN OF TEARS. There is already the real world for that: at least in videogames let me dream that a lone hero who tries hard enough can make things go right :) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Third Person Shooter: this is what Mass Effect 3 is. Do you remember Dragon Age 2? DÃ©jÃ  vu.Do whatever you want (rent, buy) but donÂ´t expect a good game like ME2 or a masterpiece like ME. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been a huge fan of the entire Mass Effect trilogy. Most of ME3 carries on the trend, allowing the player to continue identifying with Commander Shepard...until the ending. Unfortunately, all decisions, choices, actions, and events leading up to the finale have no impact on the ultimate end. In addition, though Bioware specifically stated there would be "wildly different endings" and that the multiplayer would be completely non-obligatory, those statements are false. The multiplayer is essential to gain significant war assets required for the "best" (same ending, slightly different final scene), and the "wildly different endings" is one ending with three different colored explosions that all do the same exact thing with the same exact result.

#RetakeMassEffect

Hold the Line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A complete departure from the spirit of the series in that there's no impact from your prior decisions on the ending. There are a few great scenes; but overall, it's a travesty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4H_A7SeawU4No, the ending is so not perfect at all. For those who say it is perfect, you are clearly biased and didn't even finish the game yet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played Mass Effect since it first came out. I eagerly awaited Mass Effect 2, ordered books, the collector's edition, even the Prima guide. I've replayed it more times than I can count When Mass Effect 3 was announced, I was ecstatic. I rushed to secure a collector's edition, and by the time March 6th came around I was ready to hole myself in my basement and play til I finished. And I do love BioWare. Because of Mass Effect, I bought Dragon Age and KOTOR. I applaud them for all their brilliance in the past, but I strongly believe they stumbled at the finish line for Mass Effect.99% of the game was perfection. I had chills down my spine during the Fall of Thessia, I shed a tear when Mordin and Thane sacrificed themselves. It was such an emotionally gripping game. However, the final 5 minutes is what ruined everything. Casey Hudson promised us that our choices would matter.  How do they matter in a simple choice:  red, green, or blue explosion? He promised us 16 DIFFERENT endings. The entire series was about choice and consequence. It was about weighing options and making moral decisions. All of this was completely nullified by the introduction of a God Child and the whole Stargazer debacle. The ending is so full of plot holes - why is Joker running away from a fight? Why did my squadmates mysteriously disappear then reappear on the Normandy? How did Anderson get ahead of Shepard when he said he got into the beam after him? How did Hackett know it was Shepard when the chatter says that no one made it to the beam? I personally believe the indoctrination theory, but it becomes difficult to believe when BioWare remains silent. If tanking the metacritic scores, making noise, and banding together is what it takes for BioWare to notice and make a change, then I'm all in. Hold the line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all i like to say that "Mass Effect 3" is one of the best games ever made in my opinion, even the whole series is awesome. As the reaction of many gamers shows, i am not alone who expected a marvelous finale at the end of this Sci-Fi Triology! And what have i became? A crappy nonsense telling end, that is it. That was the great announced final? I do not think so, i do not get it! So i have rated the game with 2/10 not in case of the gameplay or atmosphere, i did it, because the ending really pissed me off like most of you and EA/Bioware's Statement handled us, the Fans/Gamers like idiots and ignored our support over the last 5 years. I mean, look at all the feature's they have promised. At the end, none of the decisions i have made during the first two parts is considered. What happened at all? You can choose like in "Deus Ex 3" between 3 endings. Do not tell me that i have to level my readiness til 5000 pts.+ or my renegade/paragon bar to the max. Treat gamers like that is perky and unforgettable! Check out "Angry Joe's" Review or 10 Reasons why the ending really sucks for Example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M0Cf864P7E At least Bioware was sold out by Electronic Arts and get's in a row with Companies like Bullfrog, Maxis, Origin, Westwood and some more. It is all about cash and income shares for the Shareholders, nothing else matters. So, i have decided for my own that i will not support such ignorant policy again and i have canceled my SWToR-Account too. I do not buy a game of EA and Bioware again, til that Day "Mass Effect 3" will become some real endings, belongs to the choices i have made! My suggestion for you, do the same! Otherwise EA/Bioware do it again and again... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Amazing game.  Nuff said.Yo I'm MC Mass Effect  1, 2 & 3I really like those games but the trolls disappoint meMartin Sheen, Mark Meer, and Seth GreenWhy all the bad reviews?They have a perfect trilogy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a button masher highly over-rated game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game together with Bulletstorm from a used game store a few days ago, paid £4 for it and i think that is was too much. I played it after Bulletstorm so maybe because i had that fresh in my mind (but i had highly doubt it) i didn't enjoy playing this at all. Bulletstorm was fun and entertaining, i laughed and shot stuff and i had a good time, but with Gears of War 2 i hadn't done any of that. I am about 2 hours into the single player campaign and i really don't think i will even play it again. I got cutscenes every 5 minutes, i barely shot anything (can you even get headshots in this game?) because for some reason the enemies were moving everywhere for no reason, mainly towards my and my squads position so my dumb squad mates jumped in front of my bullets. How dumb can you get? I got lost every time i started a mission because i didn't know in what direction i should go. Story ... i am not sure there is one. They are at war with some monsters but nobody actually explained to me what the goal of the game was. Defeat the monsters forever? Give the humans an upper hand in the war? I don't think the point is to kill as many monsters as you can because there is a pretty small number of enemies in a shootout which i couldn't even kill properly because they kept moving in every direction possible at crazy speeds walking in some angles that i don't are even possible if you actually have bones in your body. So ... what is the point? What is my main mission? You go underground and ...? Graphics and sound are ok, as good as you can expect from the Unreal Engine but the feel and the story i should be getting from an action game are not there. I am not an action game fan, this is about the third or fourth action game i played, including the first Gears of War, which i enjoyed, even if it was too short, so i am not looking at some masterpiece of a game, i play action games to shoot some stuff, have fun and shut my brain down for a while i am sorry to say Gears of War 2 doesn't deliver at all. Everything just falls flat!

Let's face it, the big appeal of the original Gears was the massive multiplayer carnage. Irrespective of the notable 'host advantage', I think it was (and remains) a success.

After nailing the new campaign on the 'normal' level within 8 to 10 hours (it was too easy  and that's coming from someone who is rubbish at shooter games) I was looking forward to some new arenas and new features in the Gears 2 multiplayer environment.

Whatever the thinking was behind the new party format, IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. After 3 weeks of owning Gears 2 I have played just 1 public match. And the only reason I got into that match was because some USA based guys I met in the original Gears had a party lobby already set up.

For me, this is the letdown of 2008. The multiplayer potential is vast but being able to access it is a near impossibility unless you can easily gather a group of 5 friends in your lobby.

Whether EPIC or Microsoft are able to offer a patch to improve the multiplayer environment is a big question. Fingers crossed that something can be done.

Were it up to scratch then Gears 2 would be worthy of 4 stars or more. Since the multiplayer is such a mess and the campaign is so short, 2 is all I can give. Shame.

Was this review helpful to you?
Yes No

The new enemies in this game are same ol' same ol'. The game play is dead similar throughout. Doesn't matter if you're in a cave or a hotel, it's the same formula of sticking to the wall and popping off shots. Plus the story and the characters are booooring. Playing through the first 4 levels was like being in a coma. In one part, you and your men move through a tunnel ... and you don't have any torches. It seemed like such a cheap way to make the same gameplay "more interesting" except it didn't. Did I mention the enemies were boring. Urgh, how on earth this did game get such good scores? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Easily one of the most overrated games of all time, right up there with Halo 3 and Mass Effect. Story and dialogue is as ridiculous as the voice acting, Horde mode is a terrible excuse for a game mode. I really get upset when people argue that Gears created the "Horde" mode! Does anyone remember TimeSplitters?!?! I just cringed thinking about the voice acting again. Multiplayer is a total laggy, inconsistent joke. Thank god this is not out for multiple consoles so only the Xbox users can suffer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, I loved the first game and thought this would be pretty good too. I was seriously mistaken. Frame rate issues, texture glitches, same old same old gameplay, horrible story, extremely short single player mode, horrible voice acting. Most importantly, my 360 keeps freezing and restarting itself whenever I play this game for more than an hour. It's really weird. Anyway, go out and buy Fable II instead - it is a FAR greater game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Duck and Cover, Duck and Cover. And more Duck and cover with Bugs. Lag Online only with 5vs5. Hmm, hmm, poor game. Have good graphics, but are not the best. Crysis have better Graphics than that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the worst game I have played this year. This was a total turn around from the first GOW. I dont know why they had to add so much unnecessary plot... No one wants to fight a giant worm, they want to fight the locust. In my opinion the developers stole every idea from Halo and tried to incorporate it with the previous GOW... I was not even close the the caliber of Halo now. Do not buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

while gears of war 2's campaign is entertaining all be it short the multiplayer is what the original such a successful game and epic have done there utmost to destroy the best part of there game. i can't imagine gears 3 getting any better. if you were a fan of the first stay well away 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics is better on this reiteration but the gameplay is still very much the same. Basically hide,shoot,hide,next part. The story is nonexistent and unrealistic and the character models are still very steroidtypical exaggearated. Multiplayer is great but for singel player it is quite short and people buy it for single player not neccessariyl multiplayer 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the co-op campaign is entertaining, briefly.  but the ending is a huge let down, and it is very easy to beat.  the plot is poorly developed, and there really aren't any big changes from the first game in terms of play or weapons.

the multiplayer is awful as usual. very awkward shooter online.  COD and Left 4 Dead are 100 times better online 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Love midnight openings. Anyway, its heeeerrre...the sequel to one of if not THE most popular shooters on the Xbox 360. Gears of War 1 was fun, good looking, and easy to play...sporting a gameplay that was both challenging and easy in its execution. OF COURSE hype has been mounting for this game...and with good reason, we are told we are getting something bigger, more story-driven, and better in every way...and for the most part it delivers. First, anyone expecting a big graphics upgrade will be dissapointed and while it does look a bit better than Gears 1 (which already looks incredible), the quality and scale / size feels the same even though they do a good job of tricking you into believing its a MUCH BIGGER, MUCH BETTER LOOKING game. Sound and Music are top-notch...the soundtrack is calm / tense depending on the situation and that creates a certain atmoshperic element to the game but the voice acting is a bit weaker this time around...its a little over-dramatic and eye-rolling at times (mostly the from Dom...Marcus's friend). The gameplay is basically the same with a few added moves and animations to make things appear more "fresh", but fans of Gears 1 will have no problems adapting its still a great "pick up and play" type game. Overall, Gears 2 is a step in the right direction...it is BIGGER, BETTER, and MORE BADASS than the original even if the "BIGGER" aspect feels more like an illusion...it still feels the same "size" as Gears 1 just busier things going on in the background. Anyway, the expanded story alone is what makes this game irresistable....as it was the ONLY thing missing from the first game...this Gears of War feels SO much more COMPLETE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just like the first GoW this game is very lacking in gamplay, but has good graphics and sound. The levels are extremely linear, you can not jump (a way to restrict you from taking alternative paths). The game feels more like a movie because of how linear it is and the gameplay is never challenging. The whole concept fails to entertain me; hordes of enemies, cover/shot - reapat. It gets boring in the first 10 minutes, after 2 hours it's unbearable, even if you take breaks. None of the weapons impressed me either, never felt very fun to use which is a strange achievment. Avoid! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a great game offline but after that wtf?!? how can anyone standby that bs and give the game a 10 unless you plan on playing the campaign and returning the game, you will be dissapointed in online play. Matchmaking sucks completely. thats the truth people. it will take forever to find matches and then on top of that your chances of getting host are slim so you will be lagging pretty bad in some instances.. ive had games where the lag was 7 seconds for the shotgun. other times will have you lagging around the screen doing completely nothing and have you vulnerable to mass chainsaws... yeahh.. chainsaws rule multiplayer now... unless youre the host your shotgun wont stop a revving chainsaw before it cuts you to bits. so if you plan on playing online i highly recommend you think hard about buying this game... but if you want to play campaign only this game wont dissapoint. Horde just gets boring after youve gotten to level 50... so be wary 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so sslllllllllooooooowwwwww. If anything, this is an average game with a huge budget and a stupid guy in control, like Terminator 3. Only T3 is so much better than this, because it doesn't take 3 hours for the characters to move. Cliffy B (The producer or something), in recent interviews, seems like the sort of person who ruins online gaming. "yeah, i am t3h l33t cos I camp and kill everyone with m4h l4z0r." Whilst that is not a quote from him, it seems like something he would say. Also 5 on 5 online? Is that the best the 360 can do, seriously? Resistance (a PS3 exclusive and launch title) had 20 vs 20 online, and Resistance 2 wll have 40 vs 40. even Team Fortress 2 has 8 vs 8 (I think, I don't have it in front of me). On thje whole, GoW2 is nothing more than a big dumb action game, with a dump truck of hype, but nothing to back it up with, just like Halo 3, and Call Of Duty 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really excited for this game before it came out.   Was I ever wrong.   This game is flawed in MANY crucial ways that will leave you incredibly frustrated and generally bored.   Campaign is ok.   Seemed much more repetitive than the first.  This game is a testament to what happens when you rush a game.   This game could have used another few months of polish before release, but it wouldn't surprise me if pressure from M$ forced them to get it our the door for Christmas.   Common guys, you KNOW the multiplayer is brutal.   I've never truly known lag until I've played this game, and the overall gameplay feels very disconnected.   I've tried numerous times to "get into this game" like I did with the first, but I'll play a few rounds of multiplayer, get incredibly frustrated, and turn off the xbox.   Oh yeah, they tried to stop quitting out of matches by making it so you have to shut off your console.   Good thing, makes it easier to put in another game.   Much MUCH less polish than the original.   Z-fighting on polygons everywhere, framerate feels a bit slow most of the time, and the lighting looks oversaturated.   Remember how the first GoW was dark and set a mood?   Not anymore.   To sum it up, this is a game that had unbelievable amount of potential that was ruined by 3 or 4 crippling design mistakes.   And seriously, you want me to pay for your ******** multiplayer maps now?   How about you fix the game first. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game has major MAJOR lag, the server sucks, kicks gamers out from the lag. It also takes forever to find a game, this is with the update that was supposed to fix all this too. Overall the game was pretty fun but the online is one of the worst ive ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Expands on the original in graphics, gameplay and storyline in significant ways. Graphics are most obviously a very strong point as the vistas are emmense the added color is pleasure to behold in the older maps and gives them added dimension and realism. Gameplay has been tweeked to put more weapons on a more equal playing field. Not to mention the new weapons! Storyline as with almost all games could have been deeper but still is engrossing! AND did I mention HORDE! Great game and looking forward to DL content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the most overrated of all time. This game is awful. It is an empty mess with no direction. The first 20 minutes of the game are playable, but the rest is just a bore and a mess.
The game is empty. There is nothing in it. Like Skyrim, the story is boring and driven by doing mindless story tasks for some random NPC that you talk to.
Press A a bunch of times, scroll through the boring text, find out you have to talk to some other dude, walk halfway across a completely empty, completely thoughtless, completely boring map to find some other random NPC so you can unlock a silly story mission so you can talk to some more boring people.
It is a very dull game. It gets huge praise because of its silly illusion that you are a survivor in this giant open world. But the open world is empty! There is nothing to do in it. Boring task, that's all that's in it. Boring tasks that detract from the game feel, detract from the characters and even the story!
And the gameplay is nothing short of a insult to what the game is. Take a terrible game, make it  a first person shooter and that's how you complete the turd trifecta.
I can see why people would find this game "interesting" but a First Person Shooter with no charm and no innovative features that make it feel worth playing, in an empty world, boring NPCs and even dull graphics doesn't sound like a good time to me.
Game of the Decade? Please. Sit down turn on this that you love so much and run around with a gun in a that empty world and accept that one boring task from that ugly NPC that you skipped because you thought it was boring and then tell me its a good game.
This is not what a good game is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Blah.  Slow movement.  Clunky interface.  Feels like a game out of the past.  I couldn't handle how slow it moved - the story, the action, the movement.  It's simply a plodding hulk of a game, like most Bethesda games.  Could not recommend, even if you have hundreds of hours on your hand, they would be better spent playing several different video games than this single bloated fat man of a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Eric, the main quest is linear. You've obviously never played Fallout or Fallout 2. *compared to Fallout 1/2* the combat IS less tactical. You really _cannot_ reasonably rationalize the nuclear cars, eithe. First of all, putting a bullet in a reactor wouldn't initiate a fission chain reaction. It doesn't make sense. If it did then a simple car accident would cause large-scale nuclear devastation. To say this makes sense indicates that you really are a blind fanboy. Furthermore people would not *choose* to build a town around a live nuke. Nuclear winter has worn off after 200 years? Why are there still wooden houses standing after all this time. Hell, they weren't even in Fallout 1/2. Your point about World of Warcraft would make a little sense if World of Warcraft had been marketed as "Warcraft 4". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know this is an old game but boy was it terrible. Go here do this... go here get that... I hate fetch quests and this game seems like one big fetch quest... I bet the story is horrible... I gave up... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rented this game and I'm glad I didn't buy it. Really, I grew up on RPGs and have enjoyed them for their fun factor, story line, techniques, and battle scenes. This game never engaged me enough to play it past the dungeons. The graphics sucked in comparison to ...say GTA4. It looks like it has the graphics of a regular PS2 game (I own an HDTV and it enhances the poor graphics. Try playing a PS2 game on a 1080p TV and you'll see what I mean). Next, the characters and monsters are not perfectly drawn and have edges on them. Heck, I spent over 30 minutes trying to make my character look half decent. A lot of ways to make your character have a face of a deformed rat. The rooms and walls are flat and poorly detailed. What bothered me a ton was that the sword attacks are slow and did not give an indication if my slashes made contact or made any damage at all. I mean, what RPG doesn't show hit points when they're hit? The character menu screen doesn't tell you if a new weapon/armor is better than the one you have equipped. You only see how it looks like in your hand. Also when you're walking around (first-person), you don't know there are coins and items in front of you. The only way to know is if you move the focus point on the screen directly onto the items and only then will it tell you what it is. When I saw coins on the floor, I gave up after 3 because I had to individually pick each one up. There would've been more to complain about but I got bored and stopped playing after I ate rat meat and hacked at the king and his two soldiers. Lame game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are so many problems with this game.. The graphics are ugly and cluttered, the physics engine is way off modern standard, the character, regardless of first person or third person view feels like its hovering above ground (what a surprise that this problem occurs in Fallout 3 also). It really just doesn't work, on any console. It seems to have a severe refresh rate problem, along with lag.. in an OFFLINE game. Most melee attacks will hit at random and you spend a lot of your time looting worthless junk that only clutters your inventory, making you walk like a turtle. The complexity of making your class is beyond me, it shouldn't be so hard to just pick up and play the game, that said, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, be prepared to be bored out of your life customizing your ugly character. Given it is open world, there are no incentives. Theres no point the world being so big if you can click on your map to get 3 million miles away in a second. Most enemies are impossible to hit because of the lack of a targeting system, you spend more time spinning the camera around, waving your worthless melee weapon around until for the love of God you finally kill the enemy. Finally, when you talk to people, the camera zooms in on that person, freezing all background animation (coincidentally, Fallout 3 does this too), WHY DOES THE GAME HAVE TO DO THIS? Whats wrong with talking to them as they are? It sucks all the realism out of the scene, making you remember you're playing a [terrible] game. It's just really bad I mean I know its been reduced to what.. $30 on shelves now? Still not even worth that.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utter ****  I'll stick the with Final Fantasy games on the ps1, they piss all over this rubbish.  Wandering around with nothing really happening is not my idea of a good time.  Awful 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In 2009, I played it for the first time. At the time, it was a great experience for a small town for a ride, but after I discovered that the game includes missions, the gameplay has become boring. I saw 1-2 fun mission, but could not really tie the game. In fact, there was no patience to play through GTA III, but was 1-2 on the experience side missions.
- Let me also add that the PS2 console to control three times better than the PC 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To sum up, P4G is 90% book and 10% gameplay. The writing and characterization is really good, I won't argue that, but as a GAME it is pretty bad. The gameplay consists are very generic and shallow turn based battles with no unique features. That is literally all the gameplay this game contains. Like I said, if all you want is a 100 hour visual novel to simulate the popular high school experience and go out on dates with virtual girls, go ahead and get this game, but if you want an actual GAME, stay far away. Everything is there to serve the (EXTREMELY predictable plot, I guessed the ending after 10 hours), and honestly, the game is boring. I like books as much as the next guy, but this game is literally a book with some bad combat thrown in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so bad and overrated, it's basically a JRPG Scooby-Doo. Bunch of teenagers solving murders. It's so repetitive like Pokémon, killing 10 levels of shadows and then rinse and repeat. The story is also really weird and disturbing. It gets 2 because of the voice acting and Rise 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sadly another dated, turn based JRPG game with mechanics that grow tired and stale within a short amount of time grinding, recycling the same mechanics, look and gameplay from 3 generations ago. While critics are working PR overtime to sell people on this exclusive title, it wears out its welcome extremely quickly in the modern era.
In an era where jrpgs are free on mobile/tablets, you have to do more then the bare minimum and sadly this game does not cut it in this day and age, similar to Tokyo Mirage Sessions.
Dated gameplay aspects,  excessive filler and padding and the very questionable cultural setting/choices for regular gaming audiences in the West, make the game a complete drag.  Music is also extremely grating.

Learning more from modernized jrpgs would have been a smarter move.

Do not let blind devotion to anime and anything "Japanese" otaku culture fool you with this one.

Save your money for Yakuza maybe, one of the few worthwhile japanese exclusives. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this game a 2, a point for the creativity, other point because AT LEAST it's not broken. Despite that, it's a game that get's old too quickly, it has no objectives, no story and a poor gameplay. It's just a sandbox game for littly kids to play building with blocks that it's taken too seriously by the gamer comunity. The fact that this is one of the most sold videogames and being considered one of the best games all time is a shame for all these years of game industry. It's a really overrated game that does not deserve ANY attention. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A game in which you play as a generic block guy and run around a randomly generated world full of blocks. Your aim is a collect blocks and stack them. If you're an imaginative person you can quite possibly pretend that the game is an amazing adventure. Reality suggests otherwise. Buggy, horrible graphics, horrible AI, rushed final release. Meanwhile, the creator is a multimillionaire who passive-aggressively abuses people on twitter, takes more vacations then he actually works and abandons the game upon release. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not delivering seems to be mantra of Mojang, as Minecraft, now in final release, delivers nothing from the better priced (and less expensive) beta-release but at a higher price.

The game, if you can call it that, relies on the user to make their own fun that, while interesting for the first few hours, will quickly become boring and tedious. This can be sometimes overcome with new content supplied by it's large user-base and their custom mods (many of which were designed to fix problems within the game or with it's lack of actual content).

However, if you don't feel like taking your time and finding new mods to try and extend the game's playtime, many of these mods will find their way into actual Mojang official updates.

This product, for better or worse, is more of a "LEGOS on computers" than a sandbox-style RPG but you might have more fun with the limitations of the LEGOS than then the "here is the world, you figure out what to do" style of Minecraft. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game seems like a great idea and building is fun but...  The AI is really bad and the NPCs merely exist (they don't talk, interact with you or even run when attacked).  The game has been in beta development for years and is still bug ridden after the "official release" this year.  It's sold well but once you play, you'll see how much the developer has dropped the ball with giving meaningful updates and listening to the community.  It takes me 15 minutes to log into MY OWN server due to Minecrafts central server having issues with validation.  Anyone else trying to log in has the same problems.  The game gets very boring to play by yourself (but once again, good luck getting other players on your server).  The end dimension is very pointless and you can tell that there wasn't much effort put into coming up with it, as with most of their other updates...just read the update history and you'll see:  Mooshroom cows for example.Don't buy this and get Terraria instead.  You can usually get it for under $3 on Steam (it goes on sale all the time) and it's a much better made (and less buggy) game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It started good. The alpha was great. Everyone's arch enemy was a creeper. Notch was awesome. But then... BAM! When the Full Version came out there was more bugs than the alpha and beta COMBINED. Notch got really famous and rich that he just left us behind. And when the Adventure update came, I thought it was pretty good. That was, until I found out the NPC to nothing at all but let you trade with them. Then : Minecraft 1.0... WHAT THE **** This is nothing like minecraft! Hardcore? **** that! If you die by even FALLING off a cliff you have to start over THE WHOLE ****ING WAY.... I don't reccomend this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Minecraft is game for those, who don't have good PC to play games that have nice graphics, interesting gameplay. What can you say me about Minecraft?Gameplay?That stupid cubes are interesting for first 2-3 hours, next time they are annoying, craft recipes isn't interesting too, world is always same, same mobs, same dungeons, only location changes.I think, if this game would be developed in 2000 year it would be a super game for all people, but for today it doesn't work.So, if you don't have powerful PC or you like indie games, Minecraft is game for you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Minecraft. I voxel based block building game that shot to popularity thanks to many gaming sites. When I first found it, it was still in alpha and very few people were playing it. I had fun building it an I eventually bought it for the singleplayer. When I first bought it I became very addicted to the singleplayer but after I week, I had a huge mine, tons of supplies...and for what? I was the only person I this land with some monsters that attack you every so often. After this I just stopped playing SP because I grew so tired of just building without a purpose. Then Minecrafts popularity shot up. All my friends bought it and I created a multiplayer server. After about two weeks of building a huge town with my friends I grew bored once again. By this time Minecraft was huge, Notch was rich, and everyone was playing this game. Notch created his own company and started hiring people. This is where it goes downhill. Mojang became very lazy and started releasing updates every blue moon. These updates generally did not add that much, and most of the major content they released through updates were already stuff done a lot better by modders. They rarely fixed major bugs that have been in the game for a while and every update added more bugs. They fixed some but still some major bugs have not been addressed. Still Minecraft has gained massive amounts of popularity through all this. So Mojang is sitting around raking the money in, and people are still playing. This doesn't mean Minecraft is a bad game, it is just that there is hardly enough content to make it a real game. It has potential to be very fun. If it had better MP, where AI was actually difficult, combat was actually fun, and building bases was mean't for survival I would still be playing this game. But Mojang is just selling us a simple block builder game, and I don't see them adding any major content that will make the game fun for me for a while. One day it may be there, but for now it is just a dull block building game. And the people who whine about the graphics are idiots. Games are about gameplay not graphics...and Minecraft lacks gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I personally think this game could have been way better.

First I will talk about the pros of the game.
Yes, Minecraft encourages creativity and gets us to use our imagination, and this is appreciated. However, if you do singleplayer creative, it gets boring after a while, and if you do creative on a server, you will run into endless encounters of being griefed, trolled, etc. However with thg future updates being released, Creativity is probably Minecrafts true aspect to play this Game. Creative mode is greatly appreciated.

Well, to be honest, that's all I can really think of when talking about the pros of Minecraft. I don't believe Minecraft is good enough to be a Survival, or PVP game. What am I talking about? Well if you play survival, you build a house and survive the night. Maybe do some other things. It just feels like the updated don't really do anything to benefit Survial mode, the updates are just added for the sake of being added. It's like you play for a while, get bored, then play when new update comes out, get bored play when new update comes out etc. I really find it a pain in the @ss when playing Survial mode (and no I am not a noob at Survival).

I also believe that PVP is by far the WORST aspect of Minecraft. Firstly Diamond Armour (Enchanted and Non enchanted) really ruins the whole purpose of PVP as it is FAR better than the other armors. Minecraft PVP is not dynamic at all. It's literally people whacking each other repeatedly non stop. I dare to say that Call of Duty has a better PVP experience than Minecraft. (And Call of Duty is a piece of **** There is absolutely no dynamics to Minecraft PVP is literally people whacking each other repeatedly.

Enderpearls really ruin the aspect of PVP as well. Why? Well you can fight someone and almost kill them, then they just teleport away and you can't do anything. Enderpearls really defeat the **** purpose of Skywars (A game type on multiplayer).Enchantments add to the unbalance of PVP because they are way too overpowered, and give the user a massive advantage.The last reason why PVP sucks in Minecraft is well....LAG

Lag is one of Minecrafts biggest issues, and it's unfortunate that Mojang made Minecraft in Java. Java is probably the worst thing to code a game in, because it causes Lag as explained, and it's also easy for hackers to edit the coding to their liking and cheat. So when you get killed by a hacker in Minecraft PVP, remember that hacker probably wouldn't be a hacker if Minecraft hadn't written the game in Java.

The Next issue I want to point out is the Graphics of Minecraft. Many people say, "Oh the graphics of a game don't really matter". REALLY??? would you Play games like Skyrim if they had the same graphics as Daggerfall? Would you play GTA V if it had the same graphics as GTA San Andreas? I don't think so...

Another big factor deteriorating the game is the Community. Hackers, Greifers, Trolls, 12 year old homophobics, 6 year olds who whine and complain, people who think that they're all that, and Stupid and Biased server owners and admins really makes up Minecraft servers and the Minecraft community in a nutshell. In other words, 95% of the people who play minecrap are pieces of ****!!!

Ok so maybe you stopped reading my review after I said that, but YOU KNOW it's the ugly truth. Minecraft could have been such a better game if Mojang actually knew what the **** they were doing. But it's ok, I forgive them for being Nooby developers.

***

Well on A positive note, Minecraft is unique from any other game that's out there (both in good and bad ways), and If you are Lucky, can find a server where these issues are at a minimal. Speaking of servers, there is pretty much a server for just about every feature of Minecraft which is greatly appreciated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I must say, I gave up on the game after the wolf patch came out. And looking through the version history, the updates are freaking USELESS. So few bug fixes, mods still break the game half the time, STILL no good new content. All I see now is new textures and a few new mobs. The modders have made minecraft into a great game and yet Mojang don't take advantage of that. As it is now, the game itself is 4 hour, mediocre, half broken game, not worth your money. With mods, it would be a 75, but without, it's a 2. Mojang and Notch need to wake the **** up. The game is apparently released, yet it still is, in all honesty, a beta, if not an alpha version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

30 for this? Seriously?This game still reeks of "beta," not a finished product. There simply is nothing to do. The gameplay has no point and gets old after five minutes. Performance is terrible, even on decently-powerful computers--it simply isn't optimized. So then I decided to try some mods, but even the mods themselves are fragmented. Single-player mods don't necessarily function in multiplayer (even though core Minecraft gameplay is unchanged between single and multi), and heaven forbid you want to mod a dedicated server--that has a whole separate set of dependencies and issues to contend with. And even when they do work, they're nothing different from questing and crafting in games that you've already heard about.Maybe it's one of those games that takes time to grow on you, so I'll give it another week. I just fear that there may not be a week's worth of stuff to actually do. Other than mine, build, and kill stuff. Which I did on day one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Personally I tend to the negative side of the game. Not because of the game itself, the gameplay is fine, but the childish community of the game can be very annoying. Since the game is made by straight out java (as I know), it does not allow advanced managing method of the game though Minecraft allows some simple mods. Players can destroy other's creations easily and thus you can see how grieving is so common in this game. I understand that freedom is the main aspect of sandbox games but I think the situation may become a bit too far for multiplayer in Minecraft. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** graphicsi honestly do not get the point of this gameyou run around and create a world but honestly who is willing to waste their precious time trying to create a fake virtual worldonly good thing is you can go online and show off but even still who is that bored and lonely that they have to make a world of their own and cannot live in the real world.there are also too many creepers at night time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Minecraft, I'm not quite sure what to say about this. Before minecraft started to get popular Notch listened to the community, updated the game periodically, fixed the reported bugs within a week or two all was good. But then it became beta There were a lot of bugs of course for it being a beta. But it started to get worse. The new updates were not all great and the amount of Unfixed bugs started to pile up. Then the FULL release came out and the updates are kinda cool but it was a major letdown it contained half assed simplistic RPG elements witch could have been better if he just bothered to work on it some more. It contained several bugs and to make it even worse the multiplayer doesn't work half of the time now. This game is still incomplete because notch refuses to listen to the community anymore. At the ending result this game is half assed compared to the games that are currently available but still not that bad of a game because the gameplay is dull, if you were to get this game you better know how to install mods and to be honest even then its not worth it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is hugely overrated, grows boring after a quick play, and I know the graphics are intended to look bad, but its just ugly to play. The mechanics are boring and overly repetitive, and is not worth the 20 dollars it costs. Do not buy this game, go with Terraria or Garry's Mod, which are both excellent sandbox games. Minecraft however, isn't, so don't buy it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While I found the game fun and intriguing at first, I was playing the game for about 10 dollars and even then it was in a beta state. The game was told to fix several problems and add several new features to keep it fun. While like any sandbox game, it gets boring after time, it gets even more boring when you notice how unpolished the final game is. Several unfinished qualities that were supposed to be finished, terrible coding, and an 'end game' that makes no sense in minecraft. I would suggest playing this game on the site for free, spending 30 dollars on a game that is unfinished is unacceptable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The hype was astounding, I had to try it. Minecraft was supposedly the creative mining game that allowed you to do whatever you want. It was intended to be fun, despite the horrendous graphics. From what i gathered, you dig holes. Then dig some more holes. If you're feeling edgy you could build things and if you get lucky you'll come across some materials to make stuff. Even so, you'd have to mix and match blindly or open up the Wikipedia page on the side in order to create something useful. I admit, digging into caverns and building a fortress is kind of fun. Sadly, this game's lack for user friendly elements leaves me wondering what is the point of harvesting flowers? Personally, i believe this game is just filled with people with outdated computers trying to have fun with their friends with equally outdated computers. Somehow this ended up with them convinced that this was a good game and so a cult following was born. I decided to give this a better rating than zero only because some people may enjoy learning all the different combinations of crafting within this game. I certainly would not waste my time in this silly and boring universe called Minecraft. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unlike many other's, I'm guessing, I actually went from Terraria to Minecraft.I had so many hopes and dreams for this game, and saw so much potential as I began my new character.  Amazingly complex auto-generated worlds to explore that look fantastically different each time; What exciting adventure to be had!It was to my dismay after "raiding" my first dungeon that I realized this game has about 3% of the content that Terraria did, and I was practically already done with the game... unless I felt like making a giant Sonic character out of mud.  Minecraft has so much potential to not only be an adult version of child's "Blocks", but also an epic adventure game.  Alas, the Adventure update was a pathetic joke... which would be fine, but the devs didn't really add any other content to offset the disappointment. It's my belief the devs are happily sitting on their hands laughing as they swim in the money that people are pouring into this under-developed and under-supported game that has somehow become so popular without actually offering much of anything.Add some legitimate content, devs, and I'll be the happiest man alive.  Until then: Skyrim modding and Terraria 1.1! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

minecraft is a little bit fun but the graphics are terrible, its just blocks and bits of rubbish , cheap and not good also very unrealistic because i could just put a random block in the middle of the sky 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is SO REPETITIVE IS KILLS MY BRAIN. you start a survival game get wood build a house, get stone, get iron and get diamonds. then it just gets really boring. also its for 9 year olds 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible. The gameplay is decently entertaining with friends (but only for 2 days every 6 months or so.) The graphics are complete crap and the developers try to pass this off as attempting to be "retro" while if you look at actual retro games, they look much better than this. Even with these terrible graphics, Minecraft fails to run well on lower-end PCs because the developers are terrible at optimizing the  game. The AI in general is terrible and you can hardly consider it AI at all. Zombies run at you and attack you with no pattern. Skeletons shoot you and do nothing else. They have no death animations. You can hardly interact with villagers. Infact, villagers were pointless from the beginning, as when they were added they just came with some randomly spawned village that you couldn't do anything to but destroy or modify. They don't talk. All they do is move around a little and stare at you.   The fact that this game got a rating almost as good as Bioshock Infinite makes me sad. The fact that this game got more than a mixed rating makes me sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you happen to have a time machine handy, go back to 2010. Minecraft was at its best then. Now, in 2014, the game is flooded with content. So much so, that it's as thinly spread out as a jar of peanut butter over the Atlantic Ocean. It has too much going for it, which kills the game as a whole. It only stands up for the complete stupidity of the "vanilla" or original mode with its absolutely MASSIVE modding community. But, if your game relies on mods to attract a crowd, you might as well head on over and sign up for Roblox, you illiterate ****
TL;DR: A depressingly **** game that killed itself over time by saturating its content to the point of complete boredom. I can't go longer than 10 minutes playing this before I realize just how interesting my ceiling looks, a sign of true boredom. Consider this a platform to hold up mods, rather than a game and you can give it a solid 6/10. But, since this is a game, 2/10, you **** RIP Minecraft, an excellent game killed by oversaturation of content and a community that somehow beats out Call of Duty in the category of ****ty **** for ****s.
Good if you need your spoiled ****face 10 year olds to shut up, otherwise, don't recommend. Want a real sandbox? Go play DayZ or something. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun at first, fun for youtubers, overrated as hell, eventually only mods and plugins will make it fun. Servers if you're lucky. But guess who DOESN'T get paid? Mod, plugin and server devs. Actual game devs are lazy idiots who ride off of the success of the community and sell it to microsoft, before walking out claiming they can't handle it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overrated game, I actually don't get why those "critics" have acclaimed this game, it's monotonous, boring as hell, graphics suck, time consuming, not rewarding as you get little input after lots of effort and time for building something, it has no gameplay whatsoever and you're just there in the middle of nowhere and have to waste time building something that will look terrible anyway. The graphics are so horrible that give me headache, I'd rather play the originals Doom or Hexen instead of this sh*t with crappy design. Overrated at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The reason that this game is so popular is because it seems incredibly fun in the first few hours, first few days, weeks, etc., but the fun doesn't last. You run out of things to do almost immediately, as there is hardly any content besides playing with blocks. A novelty idea, but not a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry dont see whats the hypes about. tried it for a few days but could not get passed the dos graphics. Play Skyrim instead. you can also explore, mine, etc etc.....what is that i hear - it wont run on your pc oh shame.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not enjoying this game. It's nothing against the plot of it (Mining/building) It's just that I don't like the graphics. Large pixels and 3D games aren't my thing. I also don't like the lag that the game gives me. I lag, and I've got a really nice computer.

I don't like it, personally, but I can really see how it appeals to a lot of people! If you are a fan of 3D games, get this! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this gaem iz praty fin. it maiks me madd slumteims becuase piople break my hosues. its fun too kuill animals tho. i like makyng houses 4 powple cuaz i maek them owt uv drit 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Despite what people say, don't get this game. It's fun for about an hour or two than you wonder: "Why did I buy this game?" And if you don't believe me, try it WITHOUT mods. It's so boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are used to the likes of basically any other fighter such as DoA or VF then stay away. and for that matter everyone else should stay away. the combos may be fluid but they are not nearly as freeform as othergames. there is also a complete lack of moves. one button does one thing regardless of how or when you press it. well except the almost impossible unique moves. but aside from some chrachters having overpowered moves and other doing less damage than a really nasty fart well.... also it is not a £30 or 60$ game its closer to £100. the game simplky cant be played properly without a stick. the normal pad is to sensitive and unresponsive, to the extent it feels like it's been done purposfully so capcom can sell more stupidly overpriced arecade sticks. overall its a real disappointment, even the old streetfighter turbo on the PS1 one was a better game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A disappointment. The campaign might be good - I didn't try it. However, multiplayer is flat out boring. Limited builds, little actual strategy, unless you're really good it comes down to memorising a good build and clicking very quickly. And why would you invest time getting good if the game is boring? It feels old all around. Realism and common sense go out the window. And despite having the same number of races and units as SC1, it's highly imbalanced - try and use a mothership for a serious purpose.This is not Company of Heroes, a much superior RTS that failed because it wasn't by Blizzard so it wasn't supported or advertised well.And you can't play with people in other continents. Why not?The promised map editor/game creator fails to deliver due to the terribad custom game system. Basically maps are sorted by popularity and the interface makes it nearly impossible to play 'less popular' maps. New maps, with popularity 0, are doomed to languish on page 54 where nobody plays them; search and filter options are nonexistent. You can't publish maps across the pond. Also, you can't differentiate game types (like Dota's -ap) in the list, the hyped keyboard and mouse controls are either extremely laggy or simply nonexistent; and there is an irritating design flaw where if you are the last player to join a lobby the game will auto start and you can no longer quit even if you're on the wrong team or clicked the wrong map.Warcraft 3 survives to this date by virtue of DotA. But custom games in SC2 - an important reason to buy War3 or SC1 for many people - are completely useless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game from Amazon about a week ago for the price it usually is for a brand new PC game.
Installed it, etc...
Cutting to the main part of the review, I didn't really like this game, it didn't have the look and feel of the original game. Sure, the original Starcraft was made in 1992 and 10 years or so later it made an epic come back with this game. But, I don't see what the big fuss is about. It's trying too hard to be like C&C which it shouldn't be. The original Starcraft was in it's own league from C&C but now it's a dissapointment that this game is similar to the newest C&C game. Sorry, but I have uninstalled this game and don't want to touch it again. I played a few missions and gave it a fair few chances. It resembles C&C so much is unbelievable. I prefer SC and SC2. I'll stick to what I know. All in all, bad job from Blizzard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is shit totally not worth the 60 usd hate the music the ui the gameplay is so bad controls are crap campaign is really bad (havent finished it and not planning to do so) bottom line is ill sell it on ebay and hope i get a good price on this shitty game my advice is dont buy it if u want something a littel new than the old game cuz this is almost the old one in 3d. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A crude, blasphemous, xenograhic mockery of the real thing. The "Zerg" look nothing like actual Tyranids and the "Protoss" look ..... ridiculous. This game is nothing more than an expensive and ultimately, futile, attempt by agents of the Ruinous Powers to corrupt the minds of Imperial Youth drawn to absurd, sentimental portrayls of Witchery, Heresy and Mutation. The ending *actually* portrays a NAKED MUTANT in the arms of a Terrorist Rebel walking off together into the sunset. Utterly disgusting. Report all those who play this game to your local Imperial Youth Brigade leaders. Those who denounce their peers and siblings before the local Peoples Imperial Commisariat in writing shall be shown leniency and understanding in the form of extra bread rations. The first 300 registered Imperial Youths informing on a parent shall receive a Meat Ration. Remain true to the EMPEROR of MANr and the everlasting Revolution! Resist this foul, bland game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great game. But horrible-and I do mean HORRIBLE-online features. The new Battle.net 2.0 is so restrictive, so backwards, so lacking in even the most basic features like chat and a coherent map publishing system that it truly dampens the whole experience. What a disappointment. A wonderfully fun and fast-paced game ruined by online features that could have so easily been remedied. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utter disappointment. Felt more like Starcraft 1.5 than a true sequel. Twelve years of waiting for the exact same game, just with shinier graphics and a few new units, definitely not worth it. The writing was almost offensively bad, as well (though Blizzard hasn't had any good storytelling in its games since Diablo II). If I had bought a physical copy of this game, I'd have already returned it. Definitely not going to waste my time on the next two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The RTS aspect has been handled as expected almost flawlessly, extremely polished and already fairly balanced. However, after 12 years to think up a story and to go with this idiocy as the best they could think of was shameful. A 12 year old after smoking a pound of skunk would've done better. Shame on you blizz. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No LAN play, only 1 campaign for the price of 3, already out-dated graphics, not much new from Brood War. Sadly, Blizzards army of mindless drones will think this is the greatest thing ever. This is what we get because of WoW... the dumbest game ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well lets start off by saying yes.. i did have high expectations. and for me they were dashed. if i was 10-15 years younger and just wanted to build a bunch of units and throw everything i got at someone then yes id like the game. but when i see every good player throw up barracks and supply depots at the top of there ramp into there base to defend there base instead of there.. "Defences" which would be the point of a "Defence" because they have more hitpoints and cost ratio is better, then yes someone screwed up. as far as balancing... well its not. the old starcraft the old war horses of blizzard knew. protoss; high power low output on units. terran medium power, medium output on units, zerg; low power high output of units.... pretty simple. the game is not balanced when a good protoss player can take a probe into the enemys base and set up photon cannons and win the game in 5 mins before a half decent player can get any units up. sry blizzard but i think your failing. and this aside, no LAN? not only that but there were SOOO many more options in the old starcraft in multiplay that allowed for cooperative play on the same team why cant the A.I. have an option to build defences and turtle the game. and the campaign story line that was.. ehh.... Two words for me sums this all up, extreme disappointment. as a hardcore gamer i loved the long played out matches i played 12 years ago. well this makes no difference to blizzard im sure. but this long time SC2 fan will not be buying those expansions 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No direct B-Chat.... When you enter this game you feel alone... It has northing to do with Online Gaming. You got not real direct contact to your enemies or friends 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I heard that the new Starcraft II was coming I was so happy, but when I bought the game I realized that this game is just a copy of a Starcraft I. I was very disappointed because the only new things are some abilities and a few new units. For me this is the Disappointment of the decade. I used to love games coming from Blizzard games factory but now I get the real picture... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To me it feels like a kids game. I'm not seeing the depth that everyone else seems to notice. Also not seeing what is so great about it. I definitely wasted $60. I'll go back to playing SupCom and Company of Heroes (which are both much better). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Corporate Greed 101.  Take a beloved franchise and table it for a decade.  Then, spread the sequel across 4 years (2010 - 2013) and charge full price for each "episode."  This game should be titled Starcrap II:  Part 1.  This is part multi-player fiasco, part 3 episode single-player campaign that for some reason will take 4 years to release in full NOT counting any expansion packs.  I call shenanigans on Activision.  And there's no way I'm buying parts 2 or 3 simply out of principal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you already own Super Mario 3D Land, and play videogames alone, don't bother buying this. The only upgrade is the multiplayer and the shiny graphics. Definitely not worth $60 for yet another one of Nintendo's rehashed Mario titles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't get it. I could only play this game for 15 minutes before I determined it was a total boring waste of time. I wouldn't call it innovative. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Puzzles on a vertical difficulty slope and gimmicks that are not explained nor fleshed out in any detail make this game a pile of over-hyped, over-priced, over-flogged nonsense. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was excited for Infinite because we were back with Irrational Games and Levine. I expected an experience something like the original Bioshock. I really liked Bioshock. But Bioshock Infinite felt much more like Bioshock 2, which was a cynical money grab with no merit.

Gameplay? It's Ratchet and Clank without the fun. But that's not what we're here for.

We're here for the story. And the story is DUMB. Just plain dumb. Offensively so. I don't think I was supposed to laugh at the ending, but I did. The same way I laughed at plan 9 from outer space. This was not the experience I was hoping for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If the original Bioshock was an artistic and profoundly engaging story with decisions, atmosphere, and detailed design in a house-of-horrors-meets-jules-verne kind of way, Bioshock Infinite is a head-scratching, convoluted affair in the theme-park-design-meets-castle-wolfenstein-gameplay kind of way. It's quite clear that everything about Bioshock Infinite was "designed by committee". A roundtable of ego-centrics wanting to have their pet idea implanted in the game. Writers that practically vomit bucketloads of inane and lifted ideas on you from the beginning. Gone are the subtle undertones of ideology and dystopia. Replaced with in-your-face-eat-it dogma designed more for an audience of short-attention-span-can't-read-between-the-lines teenagers than mature audiences the title is labeled for. Much like the skylines that you simply sit-and-watch yourself zoom along like Sonic the Hedgehog (a good game), the entire game is mostly a watching event separated by periods of "find the fruit in the desk" and "dodge the angry citizen" minigames. The setting for this game is not well framed or introduced making it even more unbelievable than when you see it for the first time. Audacious and inconceivable in any alternate reality. The writers couldn't devise an acceptable set of premises to build their environment out of, so it was simply glossed over  to be assumed by the player. Sorry, this is insufficient for me. One example is using your hook to jump around. No real reason how that should be physically possible. It could easily have been designed as a grappling hook or tether to root it in the realm of "possibility", but instead things just happen magically as there are no real laws of physics here. Whatever needs to happen, just does! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whack!! Got this game for my birthday brand-new 65$ I was so disappointed!! I'm next BioShock one achievements, And BioShock two was pretty good!! The problem I found with this one personally, Is the fact that it's nothing new to me it's the same old same old running around looking for things and shooting that's all you do,,, Is the same old same old.

XBOXKLR 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes game were fun at first but the people laugh at me when I crash make me crazy I want them stop laugh. I find secret tape but no secret on it and when I grind on the rail I fall off. Game should be made less easy for people like me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game rips ass! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Same old Gta with stupid gimmicks. LAME 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As I stated in my Company of Heroes 2 this eschews good RTS for gratifying the Idiocracy wave of gamers. Getting rid of real resource management makes the game more similar to Men of War; except CoH (both of them) suck compared to MoW at the tactical level. The complete lack of realism in the game also is a buzzkiller for any WW2 fan. Had they done something similar to their Dawn of War RTS games (not that DoW RPG wannabe RTS crap=DoW2) then this might have been a decent series. This game is best left to the insta-gratification console generation. More and more games have been getting dumbed down and require little brains, this series is an example of that. There are far better games out there that require much more intelligence and provide real gameplay. I'm afraid with this game all hope is lost for real RTS games made for adults instead of teenagers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am completely bewildered by all the high ratings given this game. Obviously all these people have never played a real quality RTS before. This game was sold in parts. This game doesn't hold a candle to the C+C series. Generals Zero Hour pure gutstomps this game into the dirt. Limited unit types, limited buildings, no research poor AI and one could go blind from trying to play it everything is so small. If you want a real RTS you would do better to go get yourself a copy of C+C Generals Zero Hour and skip this dog. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The commercial and critical success of this game is proof that you could slap Mario's face on the cover of "DESTROY YOUR WII IN ONE EASY STEP" and it'd sell like gangbusters. This game is a slap in the face to truly fantastic multiplayer action titles without half the name recognition. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hated it. Button mashing at its worst. Mortal Kombat 1 on the SNES was more fun. A to hit, C to Jump and nothing else. Characters were too small to see and the pace was too fast. I finished it on my first try and half the time couldn't understand how i was winning. I'm so glad i only rented it from the video store. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You've played this game before, back when it was called "Super Smash Bros. Melee" - consider Brawl as something of an "expansion pack" and you'll enjoy it. But don't expect anything spectacular. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know if I can describe how bad this game seems to me. I've played it both solo and in groups, and it just bores me to death. I liked multiplayer brawling games like this in the likes of Powerstone back in the day, but the entire feel, control-scheme, environments, and mechanics of the wntire Smash Bros. series feels like a terrible joke. It's like Monty Python invaded Nintendo and came out with the most ridiculous fighting game parody ever conceived. Is that what people like about it? I don't know, but it's charm is definitely lost on me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Brawl is all fluff. While it's great to see lots of new characters, stages, and options, what truly makes a Smash Bros game is, let's face it, the gameplay. The Wii is a family oriented platform, and Brawl follows suit. It is easy to pick up and play, and even a new player can keep up with someone who has put lots of time into the game. Now that's great if you're a new player, but for fans who put time in it would be nice to be able to perfect a fighting style similar to what was possible in Melee. Overall, Brawl is just a soft game. Controls lag, hits don't feel satisfying, gameplay is slow - it is the non-gamer version of Melee, with loads of gratification for the newbies, enough new features to trick real gamers into buying it, and plenty of disappointment when those same gamers realize they spent $50 on what amounts to an amorphous blob  of dumbed down game design. I'll stick with Melee and the original SSB. I recommend the same to anyone who considers themselves a gamer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is suck game for knuckleheads . bad graphics for 2004 , suck phisics . This is baddest criterion games game . Good soundtracks , but Burnout Legends soundtracks better than Burnout 3 Takedown . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To enjoy Battlefield 2, you have to find a game to join. The interface that lets you find a game is so crude and full of bugs that finding a decent game to play in becomes a painful and drawn-out task. The game itself could be the greatest game in the world (its not, not even close), but the game finding/joining interface is so bad that the overall combination is unplayably bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very nice game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fact that 'trusted' game reviewers like Game Spot and IGN rate a game like BF2 so highly makes me cringe. The game isn't bad. Aside from some crazy damage modeling issues - playing the game is fine (though the lack of a bot option to fill servers so we don't spent twenty minutes waiting for enough players to join the server should be REQUIRED). The problem is all the endless bugs that plague this game. I 'played' this game for four hours last night with four friends who purchased the game, and over 2.5 hours were spent trying to get all of us onto a ranked server, then trying to find one with decent lag levels, and once we were all on and playing - the random crashes that would hit each of us every so often pretty much required us to start the entire process over again. Getting more than one person onto a ranked server is, as has already been mentioned by other people here, nearly *impossible*! Game reviewer are either in the pockets of big game companies like EA, or have no business reviewing video games when they rate a game so incredibly bug-prone as a 8 or 9 out of 10, or an 80 or 90 out of 100. It's misleading, and dishonest. A word of warning to all potential players/purchasers of this game - wait at least two to three months before you consider buying this game. By then, it may be out of beta testing (we who purchased this game when it was released are essentially the real BF2 beta testers) and only purhcase it at that time if the patch notes for this game are sufficiently long, and detailed. As for the five of us, we're going to try returing our copies of the game this weekend. I'll pick it up when it's in the $10.00 bargain bin next summer - if they've patched it enough to make it worth spending the $10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whats this game???? Its awful!!!. bugs all the time. bah! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dont buy it. It a great game sure .. IF you can play it. You gone wast time and get super Pissed off with all the punkbuster failing, connection problems, cd key gone missing. Maybe you get lucky and every thing works fine at first but there will be a moment is gone fail on you, its just a mater of when. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Battlefield 2 is a good game,very fun with mods,is a awesome war game,but there it's just unplayable,the gun spread goes everywhere,units in the game could survive about 15+ G36C (or what gun is it) without getting a single hitmarker. Unplayable,do not buy 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. All of the side-quest environments are just diffusion maps with almost no variation, there are only like five non-main quest interiors, most of the environments seem like rehashes from Knights of the Old Republic, the vehicle segments are frustrating due to poor design (jump jets do nothing but throw you off of mountains), enemies will glitch and respawn at inopportune times, character animation is just silly, graphics are jerky with lots of texture pop-up even in small rooms, loading times are atrocious, all elevators are too slow, death sequence is too long, game won't let you save right after dialog sequences (so you have to sit through them and select your choices all over again), the menu system controls so that you will accidentally exit when you don't mean to (it WILL happen), storyline is repetitive, main character can't be customized as much as you would think, stores sell inferior weapons for way too much, there are two buttons for drawing and replacing your weapon but no jump button, computer A.I. is stupid (for both friendlies and enemies), and the list just goes on and on. I don't see how this game gets such a free ride on reviews with all of its problems. On a positive note, it has Seth Green as the ship's pilot and it looks very nice in still pictures. That's all that I can think of. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buggy as hell with a disappointing storyline and weak gameplay mechanics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why does everyone like this game? It is so completely boring. The interface stinks. The art stinks. The creators forgot that Space Is Not Flat. It's cool that you can customize your ships, but the feature is merely annoying because by the time you build them, they're obsolete! The research system is just a handful of linear tracks with techs numbered 1,2,3,4. If you want to play the good version of this game, play Civilization 4. Homeworld was better if you like realtime. I have no idea why GalCiv continues to get good critic reviews, I almost always agree with the critics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This games campaign is nothing special. First of all loading anything takes forever. You don't always get achievement when a level is beaten on normal or harder. Waste of time to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very Disappointed. I was really looking forward to this, but now that I have it, I still feel like playing the other halo's. Don't like the direction they took it. That direction would be nowhere. It is basically the same game. Not enough upgrades to justify a whole new game. I feel like this would have been better served as an add on to ODST. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly so disappointing that I couldn't believe it. I loved all the other halos so much. I would play them for hours at a time. Well halo reach is a different game. I really gave the game a chance but I NEVER could have any fun. Reasons why? so many I wouldn't even be able to fit them in with the 5000 characters limit so let me end by saying this game feels nothing like the other halos. It is the product of what happens to a good game when the creators want to make more money by widening the audience but the end result is a far different, far worse game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I get this game, based on hype and because I thought Halo 3 was a decent game and that this would be better, but it wasn't. The campaign is to the point of nearing impossibility with the difficulty of some enemies. I rammed an elite with a wraith on legendary, and guess what happened? I blew up. He didn't even armor lock or anything. That brings me to my next point. They completely screwed up when it got to armor abilities. You don't need an armor ability to sprint or evade, plus armor lock is on all spartan armor. They should've had sprint, evade, and armor lock default for the character. They also have crappy online play. I mean, if you get in a game, it's pretty good, but it's a bit dull and pointless. The ranks take forever to get through. It took me weeks just to get to colonel. I expected so much more from this game, but it was just such a disappointment. They should have improved much much much more than they did. Plus, they used a lot of low quality textures. Try standing in front of someone and zooming in on them with a sniper rifle. You'll see that the textures have a lot to be desired. I play through a dull, meaningless campaign that's ruined by how they removed duel wielding, yet allowed elites to duel wield. They also let all the elites have all the abilities they want. If your a super soldier, your called that because your better, tougher, stronger, etc. than your enemy, not because you have a crappy shield that barely protects from anything and less health than a marine. Overall it wasn't very good. We give Bungie the hype and support they need to create epic games, and they just slam the door in our face with each game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has so much hype its not even a funny thing anymore. This franchise hasnt ever come close to topping Halo 1. Halo 2 added multiplayer so that was fun for a while, but this is just a money pit scheme where they use the same redundant graphics and mechanics to get people to buy it... i mean if you want proof just look at halo ost. dont tell me that game wasnt a fail. Overall halo reach wants money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Haters gonna hate, but this game didn't feel worth the hype. Only the Halo and Call of Duty series can get away with re releasing games time and time again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Basically think of everything good about halo2 / halo3 in your head.  Now remove it and think of a game made by 10 year olds with a multiplayer that now turned me into a call of duty fan because I cant stand it and its borring.Halo reach ended halo to me.  Together, removing the BR and the Jetpacks, armor lock and the other joke perks make this feel like a cheap shooter by a no name company 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Halo: Reach Around! Bored yet?I gave 2 but really it at least 4. I played one Halo before on PC and it quite good but I prefer Riven. Whats up with Master Chef? He no cook anything anyway. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a joke. I cant agree more with all the other negative reviews. a 91 seriously? its a cheesy, non-engaging, hand-holding children's game. I never did really trust Metacritic's reviews. Im sure the producers fattened their wallets happily. POS game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played this game for about 3 hours and was having a blast but then, when I came back the next day to play some more, my save was corrupted... You see, a game has to **** work for it to be fun 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I knew this was going to be over rated before it was even released, but never THIS over rated! Last time I checked Batman is a hero therefore he can't kill people but oh no not in here, you CAN kill people if you want an imediat game over, HELLOOOOOOOOOO?! The voice acting is disgusting, did they even try for their part of character? Graphics are about three years behind and controls suck to the max. The A.I. is boarder line retarded and story is way too simple, as if no thought about a real story was put in. So gamers if you are looking for a game so you can spend your fifty dollars (which this doesn't even deserve) then look elsewhere and don't use this as a last resort because it's not worth it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just gotta say, the Batman games are a huge disappointment. I bought in to the hype, and I should have known better. They're generic buttom mash third person directional combat garbage. I've played this game so many times with different characters and settings it's ridiculous. To be completely honest, the Matrix games were exactly the same thing, but far far better. The Batman games get 2/10 from me. A complete waste of money, no matter the price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring, boring, boring! Endless, ongoing dialogues hold up the game too long, as well as the endless walks from one place to the other and back again. After chapter 4, I just couldn't stand it any more! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Didn't live up to expectations. Appeal wore off quickly. Arenas destroyed PvP.  Grindy as ever. Lore was crumbling fast. Some of the dungeons were good. Wasn't worth the $15 a month. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst expansion I've ever seen. Burning Crusade DESTROYED that epic atmosphere I saw at the first game. Now we play at Outland, an entire map with green gear better than epics from Azeroth dropped from Kelthuzad's own ass. Even Hellfire Peninsula looking great I think the second game should be at Northrend. everybody wanted undeads, plague everywhere, Arthas and his minions, etc! And more: we like 40 man, we hate 25 man. We also hate to grind hundred hours to get gear that we have already spent on 60. Where is the lore? Sieges? New classes? Pandarens? Why blizzard destroyed Warcraft? And fuck the Lich King and its new Hero Classes! I can see the same shit done before and worst. Still have a dream called Diablo 3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has been going too long...people are losing their lives with this game and I'm now no longer one of them.  This add-on isn't worth the $40.  I went to a friends house to check it out and realized it's not worth the money.  I also realized it's just a game and not worth the time.  I've given it a "2" because if it was only $20 or less it would get a "8" but because it's $40 I will give it a very poor rating...just another way to give us not much for our money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dear Tecmo, I was just writing to let you know that in order to win a fight, you have to be able to actually see your opponent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've only played the demo on the XBox mag DVD, but already I don't like the game. 1. Camera control. Bleh! You have to totally stop moving to change point of view. Hello? How long have we had dynamic POV cameras. 2. World does not remember state. Clear a room, come back later, clear room again, and again, and again. On the same DVD is the new Tenchu. Appears to be a much better game. Dynamic camera control, interesting finishing move cinematics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay is very bad, just overrated because of the graphics, and thats the only reason why i bought it. The game is bad, the graphic is good. If it had normal graphics it wouldnt have been in top 100 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game starts out ok but the later levels are horrible. It goes from a nice wide open non linear game to complete linearity. I lost all interest after the Core level because from there on its nothing but alien crap. The end boss was extremely cheesy and seemed like it was added at the last minute just to have a boss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story didn't seem too bad but the game dragged on and on, it was more or less a "Go here kill this, go there plant that bomb" and it got really boring, I played it for 2 hours and un-installed right after. It may have set a graphics milestone at it's time, but that doesn't compensate for the boring gameplay. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of bullets needed to kill an un-armored enemy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hated it. The only thing that's good about it is the graphics.  the beginning was all good but then it all turned to be garbage. The flight controls in this game were just dumb.  Last boss was a joke. terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stunning, absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, the story is banal, the actual shooting within this shooter isn't that much fun, its short and it ends pitifully. The most enjoyable thing to do is to use strength to bounce around, jumping on enemies and punching them through houses, then picking up the bits of building and throwing them at other baddies.. Additionally, the suit stats are very easy to tweak in a config file - otherwise running and cloak only last a few seconds. Surely strength should make for faster running?.. Stunning, but a dull premise. Presumably this game will suffer as Doom 3 did, when it was released before mainstream PC's could handle it properly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totally overrated. Period. The story is cheesy (the voice-over alone is terrible !) and combat just isn't fun. The landscape looks kinda nice, but only on - at least - a "medium" detail setting. Anything below - and 99% of you won't even be able to run the game smoothly with even "medium" settings - looks just really, really cheap and ugly. I have a brand new high-end PC, so it's not the hardware that makes me rate this game so low. It's just that you can buy other FPS games that use your system's ressources to much better effect, like BF2 or COD4. Make sure you download the demo before buying the game and see for yourself if your system can run the game decently and to find out if the cheesy sci-fi theme is really your cup of tea. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, Like WOW! Graphics were amazing, And the use of directx 10 makes things so super sexy.
The weapons were amazing, the suits not only looked fucking sexy as hell! But also included amazing abilities, that suited not only certain conditions, but also certain play styles, like stealthy (as I'm more of a Metal Gear Solid fan), or "Rambo" style... etc.

But now we come to the bad part of my review.
I'm going to start with, what I am calling the, "fists of fury" inaccuracy.
In the game, your suit allows you to temporarily, Very temporarily, increase body functions, armour or become invisible.
So during the later parts of the game, In one of the alien missions, you encounter these VERY Matrix's "Sentinel" looking creatures, they even spread their tentacles to walk along the ground and attack you. I was being swarmed by about 3 of them, firing my weapon madly at them, throwing grenades and everything, Sparks were flying off them, but they still wouldn't die. But as one crawled closer to me, the "grab enemy" icon come up, So I grabbed this squirming robotic alien creature, And began punching it (because your weapon will automatically switch to fists when grabbing something large) and found if you increase your strength, and continue punching it, you'll actually deal A LOT more damage, than with your bolt action, precision sniper rifle, or your under-slung grenade launcher.

And the characters for the Game were such stereotypical action movie characters. Even though you're a Special forces squad, and I know for a fact you ALWAYS work in, or very close to your squad, in real life, for some reason, your higher ranking, and more experienced team leader, orders you to Leave the squad and attack a villiage of hostiles on YOUR OWN! It's stupid! I know the US army is dumb, But their Special forces aren't THAT dumb!
I'm about to talk about the story, so stop reading if you, strangely, want to play this game.
Towards the end of the game, you find yourself in the most obvious Hollywood scene ever. You've been saved by your best buddy, who you saw being dragged off and wounded by a large robot, but somehow lived; it never explained it.
You're then taken to a nearby aircraft carrier. where You're told to go to go to the bridge where you hear a general ordering a nuclear attack on the island, But an intelligent, and hot, researcher/scientist's daughter, is pleading him not to attack, because attacking them will only make them stronger. Anyway, the dumb American general talks about saving his "planet", Not his country, But his whole planet, and then disregarding ALL scientific evidence, research and suggestion, by nuking the whole island, and making them stronger and angrier... WOW! Big surprise, like that's not the over-used type of American character. That would never happen, it'd make too many other countries angry, including the Koreans who were also on the Island.
But then, after he admits he might have been wrong, nothing happens to him! You don't know if he lives or dies, because he orders you to go out on the deck, and fight the aliens that he just pissed off! When you come back, all the crew are gone! Some how they escaped while you were fighting the aliens.

And the Plot is just Stupidly and boringly close to Farcry's plot! It was exactly the same, except replace the mutated creatures with aliens... BAM! Same game, better graphics. That's it.

In Conclusion; The Graphics were amazing, and beautiful. The suit was modeled and animated beautifully, I often found myself stopping in combat, just to check out the suits. And the faces during the cinematics are so beautiful and realistic, You can actually see the emotions, It's an amazing feat.
And the special effects, were a great addition into helping to immerse me in the feel and atmosphere of the area.
The suits' abilities, the jungle areas and fooling the AI by running into a bush, cloaking then running out the other side were also very enjoyable.
So to the coders and the Artists, Well done! You guys deserve an award, or a medal. Especially the Artists, for all their amazing work. Well done.

But to the writers and game designers... Go write some low-budget horror films or action films in Hollywood, you'd fit right in with all the other senseless crappy plots. Don't write for games! The story is the same as Farcry's, the progression was WAY too fast, the change from Koreans to Aliens was dumb! Fighting the Koreans was the only fun part. Which is like the first level, so if you want to play the only good part of the game, get the demo... Seriously. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphic is awesome, but the performance is very slow. Its nearly impossible to play this game with an older system, the story is a bit boring, it is a standard story, nothing really new. The physic in this game is cool but unprecise, I often see corpses which rotating on their weapons and roofs standing on one balk and the corpses fall down like stones, its just unrealistic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is nothing but graphics. It was an alright game at first then the aliens came into the game and i was floating in zero gravity, wanting to commit suicide. This game is a terrible overrated game and isn't even an average fps it was a game that was reviewed on its graphics and nothing else showing the sad world of bad reviewers we live in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The engine may have potential, but this game reminds me of the poor quality WAD custom maps that people made for Doom and Doom 2. It's not good level design to fill up arenas with too much stuff. This game is thwarted at every turn by trying to be graphically impressive to the point where the gameplay is either ruined or forgotten. The shrubbery at the start of the island is a perfect example of this. The engine itself has an awful time dealing with this because you can't find a patch of uncovered ground that doesn't have a destructable tree, or some stupid bush. It gets old really quickly and there aren't any memorable aspects of level design that show the designers had any idea how to make the game immersive. The kicker with the abundance of items in the environment is that to keep a decent fps I need to play on all low settings, yet I have a quad processor at 3 GHz, 6 Gb of RAM and a 512 Mb video card. This game isn't a technological or graphical marvel, it's just a long series of lazy attempts at coding, and a long forgotten purpose. This just doesn't compare to what CoD4 has, or Half Life 2 - when Valve made a physics engine they incorporated it directly into the gameplay and it ran great on existing hardware or it could look great on a top of the line new rig. When the Crytek team made this they didn't factor in gameplay at all, and were so busy patting themselves on the back from overworking the hardware that they completely forgot about the experience for players. I really wanted to like this game - but it's just misdirected. It reminds me most of Quake 4 - a poor game made on a buggy engine. The reviews of this game listed above on Metacritic are very misleading. Some even give Crysis 4 out of 5 (or 80% as Metacritic shows it), yet the quotes chosen don't tally with this. You don't miss out on anything from not buying or playing this game, there are loads of other shooters that would be better purchases. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ah c'est le même problème qu'avec le premier Far Cry : une infiltration aussi limitée que maladroite, une IA qui a des yeux derrière la tête et des oreilles dans le dos. On passe alors au "plan B" sans grande conviction tout en essayant de gérer les capacités de la combi mais avec une interface aussi mal faite, ce n'est pas une sinécure, c'est juste un calvaire à manier.

Scénar digne d'une série Z, VF très correcte. La musique est insipide par contre. Mais que reste-t-il à Crysis ? un moteur graphique époustouflant, toujours magnifique malgré son âge... mais qui exige une config actuelle qui fait tourner sans souci le Crysis 2... 2 fois plus beau !

En bref, ce premier Crysis est un concept très intéressant mais mal développé et mal exploité et qui n'a fait parler de lui que parce qu'il mettait à genoux les PC les plus puissants à sa sortie. Coquille vide sans âme. Heureusement que Crytek a très largement corrigé le tir avec sa suite, prouvant qu'il n'est finalement pas un simple développeur de démo interactive mal branlée. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give Crysis a 2. Now I understand there's going to be some people all huffy about it, but let me explain somethings that people have been touting about the game ad-nausium that just aren't true. 1) The Nano suit - acclaimed to be a new and innovative, I guess people forgot that Deus Ex paved the way on that one which had all the features the Crysis one did and more. It could be said to be implemented better, but is by no means a first or the greatest about it. Sure you could toss people objects, run fast, be invisible, but the game play will still for the most part come to, put armor on shoot, kill, resuply, move on. 2) The graphics - Yes impressive, for the most part I like how it looks, however, it does not reflect how the game plays nor does it fully assist in the game play. Jungle combat is primarily one sided, ie you don't see but are seen and easily shot. I have problems with the A.I. not being impeded visually by objects between player and enemy. As well there are some major clipping / texture issues with it. 3) AI - is for the most part a step, backwards. Sure it tries squad tactics, runs to use turrets and cover at times, but all too often I found it would give up to the point where I could walk up to enemies and shoot them. In one instance a boat gave up shooting at me because I was hiding behind a rock too long, to which I then swam out to it, jumped up on to it and had no resitance as I killed the occupants. Another instance, the boat driver got stuck driving into a rock. 4) Physics engine - is great over all, still some bugs as an enemy soldier died with his hand in a latice fence where the soldier, fence and a door where unable to settle for a time. Another phyics glitch happened as I approched a demolished building which did not settle where upon standing too close to a stuttering roof part killed me. The game needs work. The sys requirements should be primary. It's nice of them to make an engine for the future, but we're living in present as well should have some substance in present games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a major disappointment. Especially after I had spent $300 revving up my computer to be able to run it. I was left extremely disappointed by the countless bugs, issues and problems that run amok in the vanilla, unpatched game. This is not to even comment on the horrible control scheme, that forces me to change my suits power preferences every 2 seconds (which is fun at first, but becomes a bore and a chore after a few minutes into combat). The gameplay is sub-par stuff you can find in ANY First-Person-Shooter, nothing new or revolutionary here. The graphics are all this game has going for it right now, so don't be surprised when you play it and realize upgrading your PC to handle it was a waste of money, like I did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It looks very nicely made with beautiful graphics and fun gameplay. However, I just bought a new 1800 dollar laptop with 4 gb ram and intense video card and Hard-drive, and Istill can't even run the game. Crytek simply asks too much of its consumers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game reminds me of windows vista. I don't have a great computer but I have a 2.4 ghz core2duo and a geforce 8800gtx but this game is still extremely slow running at about 15fps during fight scenes with the settings on medium and low which looks a lot like it belongs in the year 2001. THE ONLY REASON TO BUY THIS GAME IS IF YOU HAVE A COMPUTER THAT KICKS ASS AND HAS DX10. Other than that it sucks, its really hard, repetitive, and has many glitches. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crysis is a retarded tech demo, just like Far Cry. If seeing shiny realistic graphics and physics is your thing, go ahead and get it; if you're in for the gameplay, forget it. Another, easier way to see shiny realistic graphics and physics, by the way, is to look out the window. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not be fooled! This game is more Puddle than Puzzle, and shallower still. There really is NOTHING to do except aim and shoot; and once you've let the ball loose there is absolutely NOTHING to do except wait and watch. Hell I'd take pinball over this game anyday. Multiplayer is badly executed and boring, no real thought or strategy required to play. The only decent part is the presentation. If you really like puzzle games, stick with Critter Crunch, Shatter, or any other one. Don't waste 10 bucks on this crap... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game's lovely graphics are the only thing that kept me from giving it a zero. The story is extraordinarily dull, the controls are too difficult, and the world of SOTC is a lonely, depressing place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game. Nothing but big bosses as you would expect but you spend al your time finding weakspots and how to attack them. No real fun after the 1st monster, then everything becomes a boring, dumb, drawn out find Waldo. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

PLease. 9.1? I give this game a two because it still makes a fine coaster. Beyond keeping the dripping condensation from my frosty beverage from marring the coffee table, I have no further uses for this title. Can't move while shooting? No strafing? Four headshots to kill the baddies in the first level? Ridiculous. Back to Halo and CoD4, thanks. The Wii will continue being used to play kiddie games with the kids. Now where did I put Mario Sunshine... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The problem with the game lies within the equation: Content x Price (this math never gets old).
Had them put this game around $20, even with paid DLC; or released later (with more content on) they'd walk away with a free pass from users as well.
Also, you don't simply deny offline play to console gamers, it's sort of a cultural clash! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is simplistic. This game has only a few maps. This game has a few modes. This game is the same crap over and over apart from the huge number of heroes. I got bored after two hours and returned it to the store. It's a shooter for both noobs and pros, but mainly noobs.

It is crappy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

MGS 3 reste fidèle à lui-même et à l'esprit débilitant de la série : des cinématiques RAF (Rien A Foutre), un côté mièvre prononcé et une interface à revoir. Toujours la vue subjective qui se contrôle au stick gauche (je suis pas gaucher bordel !!), toujours les mêmes contrôles pourris pour sélectionner les objets, toujours ce problème de caméra trop haute même si on peut la faire pivoter légèrement, ce qui permet de voir un peu devant soi la plupart du temps.

Le maniement du personnage reste malheureusement bien pourri et les graphismes dans la jungle sont en net recul de ce que proposait MGS 2 : à la non-jouabilité générale s'ajoute donc la déception technique. MGS 2 était pénible... MGS 3 l'est tout autant et a eu très vite raison de la patience des joueurs les plus indulgents. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a movie not a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bloated and tedious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

God gfx and animations, but extremely poor gameplay. The Ai is basically non existent, the city feels like its full of mindless drones that dont care if a guy falls straight in the middle of the plaza. The crow blending mechanic is both unrealistic and lame. The whole future thing and animus contribute with absolutely nothing to the game experience, they bring the game no value. The story is completely childish and cheesy. The combat suggests that our hero is from sparta, and not an assassin, relying on stealth. You can easily take out more heavily armed guards in face to face combat, clearly not an assassin way. In conclusion: nothing new, no assassin feeling, dull world, same problems, boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I absolutely loved the gameplay (despite it being a bit clunky) I thought the characters were alright, but the missions still didn't really break from that repetition and some things just didn't make sense. I really liked the game economy and all the different things you can do. I loved the fact that I can drag a guy off a ledge and then jump onto his buddies with my knives in their faces. The already ridiculous story however became so convoluted and just so sickeningly weird. I was really liking the game by about the middle. Near the end it was getting weird, but still pretty good. The ending (which I won't spoil) Was just so terribly ridiculous that I got a headache. This game's terrible plot makes all the joy that came from stabbing your way through mobs of guards and corrupt officials turn sour. I wish that I had not wasted my time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has pretty good graphics and acrobatic for sure... but the same boring repetitive gameplay, horrible AI and standard storyline and poor missions remains. I can't believe this game is rated 91, rent this game, this was the last time I play any Ubisoft's game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it is so sad to think about how awesome this game could be with the nice graphics and optimization... After that amazing intro, i could never imagine how boring and repetitive it would get.

Boring because of the completely nonsensical plot and back story, lame villains and the disappointing boss battles, specially the first one with Sahelanthropus, they really took a dump on the game with this one:
-Snake is infiltrated in a high security military base filled with soldiers, war tanks and war helicopters.
-If you decide to escape the base without the walker machine, Snake is on feet, carrying a crippled prisoner plus all those weapons.
-"Skull face" somehow knows about it, he could command all the soldiers in the base to kill Snake easily, but instead, he decides to make Snake a surprise on his exit and show him Sahelanthropus for like no reason at all.
-From one second to another, all the soldiers in the military base just vanished, the high security military base is total empty and simply abandoned now, forget about them, it is only Snake and Sahelanthropus now. (the same happened when you are about to secure the remains of the man on fire)
-Sahelanthropus with all its power and greatness is unable of killing Snake, even if he is standing right in front of it at a open field and a clear shot vision.
-Snake escapes Sahelanthropus and the military base on feet, uncovered and carrying all those weapons plus a crippled prisoner on his back.
-Snake calls the helicopter to pick him up in a place where Sahelanthropus can see.
-Sahelanthropus is unable of taking down a chopper.
-Snake gets in the chopper and destroys Sahelanthropus with shots from a .50 machine gun.
Seriously? Even a old war tank could handle those shots or take down the chopper but the weapon supposed to bring to world to its knees could not?

About being repetitive, some people say that it is only if you play always the same time but that makes no sense at all.
It is nice that i could do all the exact same missions all over again in a different way if i wanted, not that i was bound to do it anyway so i can get to the end of the game, which by the way, was cut out from it. The game has no end at all, what doesn't matter because the story is so boring that you do not have desire to know what happens next.

MGS 5 begins a joke on Ground Zeroes (a game that is as short as their dicks) and "finished" on the Phantom Pain (japanese anime **** recycled so it looks bigger) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is mediocre as **** is just empty gameplay. The story is not there, it just isnt there. Game is very empty and after a couple of hours it becomes just forgetable. The FOB system is pure trash and the online is a call of duty stealth is dead. Pirate this game, dont buy. **** YOU KONAMI 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who has never played an MGS game before, I didn't really know what to expect. The story line is ridiculous at best. Why is there such a disconnect with reality and a focal plot in this game? The invincible supernatural enemies, for instance: A red head girl in a gas mask wearing a sweater that's 5 sizes too large for her torso, green eyed zombies in gas masks (again the damn gas masks...), or a hulking man made of lava. This entire subplot makes zero sense, and even after reading up on previous MGS lore, it seems their writing has always been absolutely bonkers and juvenile to begin with. The gameplay is poorly executed, the world is bland and stale, missions are repetitive and boring. Each point of interest on the map is loaded with identical assets and enemies. Stun this guy, kill this guy, click this objective, rinse and repeat. I seriously do not understand the reasoning behind this game's score. I'm all about open world games (The Witcher 3, Elder Scrolls, Fallout, etc.), but this is a joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While gameplay is finely polished for the most part there are some massive flaws: particularly the open world nature . The environment is essentially lifeless and bland between outposts and the details within the buildings are sparse and lacking. Despite being open world the map (Afghanistan in particular) is very linear and allows only a very restricted travel route along roads (often winding) from one place to the next which often takes forever even by horse.

The main missions are for the most part repetitive and stale and revisit the same areas over and over (the side missions are absolutely tedious because of this).

The story is unfinished (given kojima konami split earlier), uneven, jarring, filled with plot holes and can appear mind boggling and laughable at times. The characters are unappealing and poorly developed. You'll scratch your head many times trying to understand a plot twist or wacky unprovoked character behaviour...

You'd hope dlc would fix this but it wont given ongoing developer publisher relations and its too widespread and major a problem anyway. A great shame; certainly one of the wackiest and most non sensical games I've ever played (even compared to past mgs).

I've stopped midway through chapter 2 now and have done with the game, its that rubbish; try witcher 3 (100 x better than this) or mad max (unrecognised hit) instead or hold your breath till fallout 4 because this game will leave you frustrated....

I don't recommend this and I struggle to understand how this has been getting perfect scores (no game is perfect even at the best of times)

As a fan of the Metal Gear series, particularly 1, 2 and 3, this game has left me disappointed. Why is that? First, it's an open world game. Now mind you, I have nothing against open world games. Open world games can be a blast if done right. Since this is the first time Metal Gear has gone open world, I had high expectations that they'd not only meet but exceed their competitors when it came to creating a world that you actually want to explore. I mean, what is the point of making an open world game if it's not interesting to traverse? If you're not going to do that, just make it a linear game like prior games in the series and perfect each space by littering them full of interesting things to see and do. And here is my first complaint with Metal Gear Solid 5: the open world is uninteresting. You have Africa and Afghanistan - both overly brown, void of much life, and little to hold your interest while moving throughout the world. While there are side missions sprinkled throughout the world, the side missions are, sadly enough, entirely filler content that does little to add to the game. Actually, they sort of detract from the game overall. Instead of creating a linear, narrative-driven Metal Gear Solid, they've created an open world, one that doesn't have anything interesting going on in it, and then try to throw in some copy & paste side missions that are incredibly uninteresting and by-the-numbers in their design. But, then, the story must be good, especially if you're a Metal Gear fan, right? Wrong. For whatever reason, Konami replaced their old voice actors with new, more recognizable actors. For example, instead of David Hayter, we get Kiefer Sutherland. Not only does his performance fail in comparison to Hayter's, he rarely even talks throughout the game. And here's another issue: there's barely any cutscenes compared to the prior Metal Gear's. While I'll concede that prior Metal Gear's may have been overkill when it came to cutscenes, but they've swung the pendulum so far from that that there's not enough now. I do agree that the gameplay here is solid and enjoyable, but when the world it takes place in, the narrative that surrounds, and the extra content is so poor, I can't give it praise that it simply doesn't deserve. If you're a fan of open world games, this will disappoint you. If you're a fan of Metal Gear Solid's past, this will disappoint. As a fan of both, I'm floored that people are giving this game high marks. I can only surmise that it's because people were really hyped about it and now they're forgiving issues that they'll soon come to dislike. As is the case very often with people who play games and people who write about them, they sometimes overlook glaring issues when they release and then only come to grips with the fact that the game wasn't all that years down the road. Metal Gear Solid V is one such game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cant belive this game is praised as much as it is. I loved Metal gear Solid 2 on PS2 long time ago and with the amount of hype for this one I downloaded it and tried it. I allways try my games if possible with cracked versions before making a decision and thank god I was saved by a cracked download.

This game is absolutely trash when it comes to PC, the controls are **** beyond retardness, the gameplay itself is really boring and dull and it feels like you are playing a gamecube "open world" game.

The game starts out complete **** aswell. 30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay,30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay,30 sec sequence, 10 sec gameplay, etcetc.

I have no idea what the hype is all about but I would not advice ANYONE to pay for **** like this.
And I really tought this was gonna be something new. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is truly BBB game. Boring, repetitive with one of the worst plot ever done. I'm mean not even worst Uwe Boll movie, or worst comic book has so crappy shameful story. OMG I was so ashamed to play this game, I'm lucky my girl never seen those Quiet anus zoom Kojima loved so much. Or CodeTalker speaking about parasites turning man into woman. This is game gets "the worst most expensive game ever" award. This whole open world. I've seen better open world 20 years ago. It's empty, it's boring, it has no artistic value. This game looks like someone worked over it for 2 weeks and then did nothing but copy and paste his own work. This is the last MGS I ever played even if they do another instalments. Kojima has show as who he is. His like Venom Snake. Imposter pretending to be artist. He's Uwe Boll of video gaming but with worse skill to write story. Great hero Big Boss put to end. If you think MGS4 had stupid story, you will not believe how **** this one is. Game is most boring experience I ever had. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

-Terrible story which was also badly presented
-Boring missions (99.7% of them)
-Frightful hit detection (especially with a horse)
-Only one real boss fight

+a lot of gadgets
+good looking rain effects
+helicopter 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First and foremost I will award the game 2 points for the great performance(for the most part) of the game on consoles. However, there are still stuttering issues at times during the game, which require a hard reboot of the console to correct. This game's story has to be one of the worst I've heard in years and there's not even a satisfying conclusion to it all liked you'd expect from the final Kojima Metal Gear Solid game. And this is a huge problem because it makes the game feel unfinished when you combine that with the fact that Chapter 2 is just you replaying the same missions you already played on a higher difficulty. The games gives you a decent amount of options, but the actual level design doesn't encourage you to stray from the norm and try new things unless you just spam headshots over and over because then soldiers will start wearing helmets. The open world is barebones, lifeless and dull as well as a chore to travel with mountains that exist for no other reason, but pure padding and to impede your way. On top of there is no variety in the environments that you encounter in the game apart from the prologue, which strips all control from the user and is overlong anyway. This would be okay if the environments in the game were actually interesting like with previous Metal Gear games, however MGSV's depictions of Africa and Afghanistan are as uninteresting as can be, which is absurd(especially in Africa) considering the amount of landmarks and variations it has. MGSV reminds me of a 3rd person Far Cry 4, but with better mechanics, an even worse world and even more repetitive side missions. Both games can be "fun" for a time, but you'll end  up with a very bad taste in your month after a while and especially once you're done and reflect on what you've done in the game. The side ops are a joke, have no context and recycle the same areas and objectives from the main game. My advice if you must play this nonsense is to wait for a sale so you're not as disappointed in your purchase as I was. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this is not metal gear solid.
the introduction sets up some stuff that is pretty intriguing.
after that you are sent on bullcrap missions having to do menial tasks that have nothing to do with what was shown in the introduction.  I'm sent to take out bases on my own, even though I have a base of soldiers who could swamp the area in seconds.  I'm told to develop weapons that in past games were 'procure on site'. I am told to collect resources and plants.  an errand boy.  of course we could look at it another way. we kidnap these russian soldiers and it turns out they have no allegiance or national pride. no integrity. so I then have to question what they are doing here. I'm also questioning the point of building up this base, when it seems like they would have no chance against skull face or that floating red headed gas mask girl. it's clear from last games that snake is best as a solo operative, so building up this base is nothing but bullcrap busy work.

I've struggled with this game since I got it. struggled to try and push myself to get to the parts where the story picks up.  but having looked at other reviews it seems I have wasted my time. I am a mug. my only consolation is that i got a pre-order from a different site at a 25% off.

F*** Konami. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buenos gráficos y poco mas, muy repetitivo y se nota que el juego se ha hecho a empujones sin dar la sensación de estar acabado, han querido convertir esta saga en un Sandbox y lo han destrozado convirtiéndolo en otro juego,

No es un Metal Gear, me imagino que todos esos 100 de las revistas o web son porque lo han jugado 5min como hacen siempre. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'd consider Witcher 3 a great game were it not for a number of issues. The inventory system is a mess. For an action game, the controls are sometimes surprisingly unresponsive. Quest-scaling is all over the place. Loot scaling system is designed to almost consistently reward the player with garbage. The experience is also marred by the game being built around two contradictory design philosophies:
1) Geralt should be poor
2) Geralt has to constantly upgrade his equipment - which a poor Geralt should not be able to do.
This built-in contradiction in design forces the player to focus too much time on scouring the gameworld for the means to upgrade, which can become quite tedious.

That being said, with the way CDPR has been patching for XBox One, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. Every patch has introduced problems, but the latest one really takes the cake:
-all DLC's broken
-reduced functionality
-new graphics issues, some of which are migraine-inducing
-new AI bugs
-downgraded performance (again)
-missing items
-savegame issues 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the first time I have ever been annoyed enough with a game to post a review.  This game is HORRIBLE.  The entire user interface sucks (player controls, map, alchemy, crafting...All of it).  Visually it makes me seasick to even watch the screen.  The fonts are way too small to read anything unless I stand 3 feet away from a 56 inch 1080 TV.  Countless cut screens and countless trips to the internet to try an understand what I am supposed to do - generally to just start a mission. "Follow the ravens using your witcher senses" somehow really means "meditate until dark".  What a joke.

I have managed to play this POS for over 100 hours and never once smiled.  Don't waste $60 on it.  It'll be in the Wal-Mart $7 discount rack soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let's start with the good! The lighting was well done, excellent variety in enemies, and the lore and storyline are very well done. So yeah, that's basically all the good I can say. TL;DR rating at the end of each segment.

Now onto the bad...

The voice acting was AWFUL and it complete ruins any immersion despite how hard you try to like it (and believe me I tried very hard to like this game). 0/10

The graphics aren't as advertised and are not what you'd expect from a game at this point in the next gen console's life. AC Unity has far better graphics despite being nearly a year old. 5.5/10

Music is okay, but not nearly as good as Skyrim's. I still give it a 7/10 since they didn't cut corners here.

Combat is horrible and needlessly over complicated, considering you only have like two-three weapons and 5 spells. Even on the easy modes you die too quickly. The blocking mechanic is choppy and useless if you're against a group of enemies. The dodge/roll button does nothing since most enemies can attack you while you're rolling. 0/10

The crafting/alchemy thing is awful too. Remember how Far Cry 4 had an annoying number of plants for making potions? Well this game is even worse for that. It's not like you can forego this though, as you need potions/oils to fight certain enemies. 0/10

The gameplay and controls are awful. It is such a pain to try and use a ladder, mount your horse, swim, etc... GTA has generally bad swimming mechanics, but they seem godly compared to this game's swimming mechanics. I literally will do 4 underwater backflips and drown before I resurface. -5/10

This is an even bigger disappointment than Destiny. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

for me that was the 2015 disappointment
Extremily long load, no character customization, poor skill customization (is greaty if u r a warrior, bad if you are a "witch" LOL), bad AI, the game is terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite possibly on the list of the worst five role playing games I have ever played. Don't think that the fact that Black Isle, developers of Fallout and Fallout 2, is on the box means that it is up to that standard. Boring, cheesy storyline that is not even half up to par with any average Dungeons & Dragons group at your local card shop, slow, redundant gameplay, poor engine, and awful graphics combine to make one of the RPG genre's greatest settings into a disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its been a while and im going to make this as short as possible its a fun and polished game but its slow the updates are slow and i dont see them getting faster the team does not know who to nerf and not the matchmade system isint that great even tho  they anounce most of the stuff i have random disconects from the server that just closes my game and does not give me any xp and overal for a 40$ base game its just not enough and right now the biggest mistake ive made is made my friends quit other games for this game some of them dont even follow me around in games anymore since this turned out to be a huge dissapointment for them and slowly im starting to view it from their point of view on the good side the developers post every update and plans in videos on their youtube channel and they seem to listen to their fans but how long till they stop ? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it is a good game to play with friends bat ti sud be free to play because after a wild the player base it well be 0 and well by dead :(:(!!!!!!! the same like titanfall and Evolve and u bay a game and u have microtrans is stupid !!!!!﻿ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What may have started at a great concept on paper, ends up being a total disaster in game form. The game plays out much like a team-fortress mixed with some MOBA elements. The MOBA injection gives each character a personal set of "skills" to use in matches that mostly consist of domination matches with a few "payload" rounds thrown in to keep the gameplay from going stale ~too~ quickly.

It's fun with friends in short bursts. But, if you plan on playing by yourself or for a prolonged length, prepared to get frustrated and bored.

One of the few things that isn't pointed out much in other reviews is the horrid hitbox and tickrate that this games net-code utilizes. The game seems to favor the player with the higher ping (As sort of a 'benefit-of-the-doubt mechanic, I suppose), where... so long as they were on your screen at the time you attacked, they will be hit. So, there will be many times you'll scream in frustraition because you've backed around a corner, and still end up dead because the gunfire still manages to somehow make contact. It's very evident on Roadhogs chain-pull because in many situations, you'll find yourself glitch through the environment. But, you can also see it occur in many game-highlights where the game will snap the players view around to account for tick (making it appear as though your opponent is cheating via aimhacks, when-in-fact, they aren't... the netcode is just that terrible).

That, coupled with the community's current trend of hanging on to characters with broken or easily abusable skills ends up making this game extremely frustrating a large part of the time you're playing.

I really don't have a problem with cosmetic microtransactions since they hardly affect gameplay. However, the RNG system can be pretty crossing if you're looking for a specific character skin or animation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SO MANY BUGS BUGS BUGS... and Who call it as shooting? It's more like lol. But match making system is worse than lol. Character balance is BAD. Just like lol. If you pick `weak' character, you will listen a bunch of swears. After the game, you push a report button. But nothing is changed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Micro transactions after you pay for it?  How lame.

Blizzard should be ashamed.

I'm giving it a 2, though, because it's the first time in over a decade they've come up with something that isn't directly from their Starcraft/Warcraft/Diablo universes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was a fun casual game that you could play for a few hours a few solo or with a friend. But now that "competitive" is out, the community has gone to sh*t and the MMR (match making rank) is utterly horrible. How can a game that allows you to join as a single player not even reward you one bit even though almost carry the team and end up loosing? If you do not join as a premade as of now this game mode is not for you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overwatch is superficially pleasing but the depth is nowhere to be seen. There are no alternate weapons for characters and they can only be played in one or two ways. Their abilities are far from original, borrowing heavily from a variety of games. To top it off, some abilities don't even require aiming. In an FPS. Do you see the contradiction here? A genre that's supposed to reward skill. In addition, hitboxes are completely wack. Simple google this (and look at videos about it) to find out how silly they are. Oh, a word about "progression" too. There is literally nothing to unlock except cosmetics. That'll surely help its longevity!

To summarize; a game that looks good on the outside but has very, very low depth and doesn't require as much skill as any budding FPS fan would want it to. This is pretty much Baby's First FPS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Este juego esta muy incompleto!!!!!
Ahora demuestro como valoro el juego.

Historia:2.5
Comunidad:5.0
Contenido:3.5
Precio:(60$) 0 (tendria que ser free to play!!!!)
Historia de los personajes:4.0

Obviamente no se quien mas cree que la prensa de overwatch esta muy comprada , desde cuando overwatch es mejor que gta V , Uncharted 4 , The witcher 3 y sus expansiones.

Es obvio que Blizzard pago a la prensa para tener ese numero no?. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Плюсы:
- Много героев
- Отличный дизайн карт и персонажей
- Хорошая работа над звуком в игре
- Да почти вся игра сплошные плюсы, но есть один МИНУС, который перечеркивает все плюсы игры

Минус(ы):
Матчмейкинг - По личному опыту, и опыту друзей понял для себя следующее - если ваш уровень побед достигает значения близкого к 50% (винрейт), и вы относительно средний, хоть и скилловый игрок, но без 5 друзей в пати, можете как правило готовиться к унижению, игра будет жестко держать вас в рамках винрейта 50%, шаг влево, шаг вправо, наказывается "случайной" серией подбора матчей где противники на 100-200 уровней выше вас, а ваши комрады на пару десятков уровней ниже вас, либо почти сразу после захода в матч вы видите чудесную табличку "ПОРАЖЕНИЕ".

Итог:
Не вздумайте брать игру, при текущей системе матчмейкинга она прямо открыто будет вас наказывать за успехи если:

- Вы играете только соло, или с двумя-тремя друзьями
- Вам важен не только процесс, но и игра на результат (винрейт, росто скилла и т.д.)
- Вам не по душе игры с токсичными игроками (привет любая моба)

Берите игру если:
- О боже это ж близзард!
- "Ну... у меня все в классе купили, чо я как **х буду?"
- Я не замарачиваюсь, люблю пострелять под пивко.
- Автор криворукое рачье, а я в топчик за пару деньков. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am sorry but this team fortress 2 knockoff is so horrendously bad it makes me question if blizzard is still a triple A developer. There is a massive imbalance with the characters, the game modes are not unique at all and have been done to hell and back, the matchmaking is piss poor.

Blizzard has always had a balancing issue, but you cannot have that in a game like this. After 3 matches I would rather be playing tf2. I am sorry 2 out of 10 cause the art style is good but the game is sheer RUBBISH! Dont even bother, blizzard screwed up. Those giving this game a pure 10 should be met with a grain of salt as the game is just terrible. Its not worth 60, not even worth 0. Dont bother. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Korean hackers are ruining the game. If you play from the US West coast, Europe, or South East Asia, you will be paired up with Korean hackers. In Korea, Overwatch itself is free. Players use "PC Bangs", internet cafes, to play and pay the cafe, which pays a royalty to Blizzard. Blizzard is actively profiting from the PC Bangs allowing users to download cheats, and letting the PC Bang operates do whatever. Normally this wouldn't be such a problem if you have cheaters facing cheaters. But said cheaters are coming over to the non-Korean servers to climb competitive ranked games easier. If they start to lose the match, they'll turn on obvious auto-aiming cheats enough to reverse the game and win.

Blizzard is making a LOT of money off of the PC Bangs and has no plan to deal with the cheaters. Do NOT buy a game where cheaters get the game for (mostly) free and are not banned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overall disappointed in Blizzard. I really really wanted to give this game a chance.   I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft 1 on PC...owning and playing every game they have released religiously.

Overwatch has good character design, smooth game play, decent graphics on PC/PS4 but no innovative features or game modes that will pull me away from any of my top FPS/TPS games (old and new).   Overwatch is a simplified FPS compared to others and it's not necessarily a bad thing.  The maps are well designed for close quarter battles and the game doesn't drag long.
I think the simplicity of it will draw new players to the genre so they can pick it up easily.   To me,  it seems like they made this game for beginners to the FPS genre.  Sure vets can still play it and have fun with the characters abilities but if you look at it overall it's not as FUN as it can and should be.

It reminds me of the same thing they tried to do when they entered the MOBA genre with Heroes of the Storm.  They simplified it compared to other MOBA games but I got bored of it quickly.  Maybe I'm an old hardcore gamer and I want to get my money's worth.  But $60 is alot of money for a multiplayer only FPS game with only 2 modes  There's not even a campaign with all the story behind the characters.
Star Wars Battlefront basically multiplayer only but Battlefront is a much better FPS.  Like AMAZING compared to boring Overwatch!  Plus, the 2 game modes of hold the area and move the convoy aren't really exciting at all to play.  Couldn't they think of something more creative?   Heck! The game modes in Unreal Tournament especially 2004 still blow the Overwatch away.  Unreal 2004 (and on) still has the most enjoyable and creative progression objectives like Assault, Onslaught, etc.    Instead of a boring hold this spot then protect this new spot or convey.  It would've helped Overwatch tremendously if they learned from the game modes of Call of Duty, Castle Wolfenstein, Unreal Tournament and not just copying mainly Team Fortress.   I would've gladly pay $60 for this multiplayer-exclusive FPS game if it had better modes and features.  For example, maybe with some maps or modes they could have a train fight scenario to find the bomb, destroy big turret by progressively completing objectives.   So Overwatch is just a plain shooter.  Nothing special at all.  You could play any sci-fi shooter of the past and still get the same experience but just without the awesome character design.

Overwatch took some good ideas from some FPS but not enough to make it great.
It's just a "clone" FPS with a gorgeous reskin of characters with special moves.
I'm a big fan of Blizzard and have played all their games religiously and even own collector's edition of all the PC games (from Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft and I even bought the Overwatch one).  But I'm sorry I have to give this one a bad rating.  Not sure who took over creative directing at Blizzard but this one is a fail to me.  It might do well for teeny-boppers and millenials that jump on the hype.  And most likely Blizzard will front a bunch of $million dollar tournaments because they can.  But that still doesn't help make this a great FPS.  It's below average to me.  Even Team Fortress and Counterstrike are more fun than this.   They may only have a few maps or modes but they were the originators and still the BEST.  Blizzard tried to copy them and some other FPS but ended up being flat in the end. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could've been a good f2p game you can enjoy with your friends. Instead it became a mediocre FPS with little to no content, minimal playerbase and the worst micro-transactions and loot systems you can think of. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

* too simple
* too casual
* too slow
* graphics for little kids
* nothing new or innovative in this game

Yes this game can be funny... for short time, there are better and cheaper games to spend time with your friends. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a TF2 player with 2500+ hours, this game was supposed to be a refreshing new experience. Instead I got a frustratingly badly optimized game that wont be fixed for years and years.

Balancing 20 something characters isnt just hard, its probably impossible. Its such a mess of either combos of characters or single characters that literally kill anything if you happen to be unlucky.

A "shield guy" can be combod with a "turret guy" and literally destroy anything in its path. The shield is too strong to destroy right away, and before you even get a chance the turret guy will kill you. Rinse and repeat. Always works. Bad. Game.

Then theres the cowboy guy thats currently overpowered. Hes so good right now that if you accidentally come withing 10-15 feet of him - you die. No need for why and how. You just die. Thats just bad design.

Then theres a lack of stuff to do. Almost all games are identical, and for a game thats supposed to last for months and months, maybe even years (TF2 9 years soon), Im finding myself bored of the content after just 2 days.

The loot is all cosmetic and VERY limited. Youre looking at a couple of re-colors (lazy developers) and tops 2 actual changed cosmetics on every character. Not a lot.

No, this game needs to be given a few years more of developing and fine tuning. If it were up to me Id completely rehaul the damage system. Right now you can literally die before you have a chance to react. Its not COD. Its worse than COD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Маркетинговая пустышка от близов!
Мало Героев .
Мало карт.
нет прокачки .
однообразность.
надоест за пару дней. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With Blizzard being a billion dollar company and having their reputation as quality game developers there is no excuse for Overwatch to be running on 20 tick servers. 20 tick servers are what games in the 2000's era ran on, and basically makes the game feel like you're playing at 150 ping at all times regardless of your internet speed. In comparison every notable modern day shooter has 60-128 tick servers. Completely unacceptable and a disgusting display of greed from Blizzard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

absolute joke that this game is scoring as high as it is. made the mistake of playing the beta and then buying it not realizing i was getting nothing more with it. they essentially released an incomplete game with the lack of the competitive mode that they are releasing next month. the fact they put in micro-transactions for the loot boxes which are literally the only unlocks is a real slap in the face too.  it is a sad world we live in that we as consumers continue to buy trash allowing these companies to keep putting out more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It does have fun characters to play, but the game itself has absolutely no replay ability. There is no balance on maps and some characters are too powerful in the game that needs nerfs.  All the game modes are stolen from TF2, no clue why people are calling it a "fresh" FPS game. Pure waifu bait and amazing marketing strategy by masterminds at Blizzard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is one of the most overhyped piece of **** ever made, come on, I have more fun playing 90's fps.
This game is just a poor copy of Team Fortress 2, there's no strategy involved, just mindless shooting and shooting without any tactic whatsoever, call of duty style.

Bad Things:
- No good single player mode (poor AI bots only)
- Bad and REPETITIVE gameplay overall
- Microtransactions (pay to win)
- Very high pc requirements
- Very expensive launch price
- Uninspired characters
- Weak weapons
- Extrene overhype
- Lag

Good Things:
None

Veredict: This game is one of the main reasons that I lose faith in modern videogames, I rather play classic videogames instead this expensive garbage.
Blizzard tried so hard to make more money after the fall of wow, and they failed miserably.
2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A poorly balanced game with only one game mode, and no single player. I really don"t get what people think is good about this game. It's boring and repetitive, i don't know how people can play this for more than a week without getting tired of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sin duda lo mismo de siempre, claramente un TIMO, como es posible que cobre un juego a precio completo, SIN campaña, full multijugador y ademas incompleto, es divertido no lo niego pero es en EXTREMO repetitivo, pocos mapas, pocos personajes que ademas están des balanceados, sin modo competitivo.
En fin un poco divertido, NINGUNA innovación, precio abusivo y claramente es una copia descarada de un FREE TO PLAY (Team Fortress 2) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game gets boring really quickly, it has microtransactions and no trading system so we are forced to keep buying 'loot crates' to find whatever we need and there is no other way to get a free loot box besides gaining an account level which gets painfully slow after level 15 or so.

The game aldo needs way more heroes since they aren't that complex and switching them all the time gives the feeling that the gameplay is repetitive.The Game looks nice and all but for a few hours just aint worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just another generic team FPS that really brings nothing new to the genre. Add microtransactions over an already full priced game and you have a powerful cash machine. Since Blizzard fans are already in "farm status" for the company, they can keep releasing low effort software like card boards, MOBAs and team FPS and making a lot of money. Good for them, bad for the videogame market's overall creativity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good mechanics, good graphics. The balance of bad characters. The game for the money, you buy the game and then you offer to buy trunks for real money, accelerating the collection of skins, graffiti, etc. Personally, I believe that the right to introduce paid services - this is not respect for those who bought the game. With the introduction of such ulug this game is similar to the model F2P. It is not glad that he bought. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

-Lack content

-No motivation for play

-High Price

-Mechanical repetition

-On the face of it, it looks like different map different modes, but it's just all the same to me

Just a copy of TF2 but for 40€.

Only 2 Gamemode, all chara unlock, no progress except ugly tag ...

Please, stop be blind because Blizzard product ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The tag "Blizzard" and the extreme marketing campaign are tricking Gamer's of all types in to purchasing this unfinished potential. Overwatch, a game that should currently be F2P, is leveraging its Blizzard name to sell. The game features 21 unique Heroes, which is the only Pro to the game. Between poor level design, normal game modes with no team death match, no support for current PC hardware, and extremely low replay ability, this game falls flat. After playing for over 10 hours, it is inherent that this game is missing so many features, settings, options, modes that would be normally found in any other current release title in regards to FPS. It takes a whole 10 min to see everything this game has to offer, and begin questioning while you are still playing. The Gamer community has left feedback since the first day of the Beta, in which Blizzard has completely ignored and/or created excuses for. An example is 21:9 support. A widely popular request, as it can be found in almost all other titles from 2015 forward. Blizzard says they do not have the time to add it to the game due to artistic work needing to be completed. However, they do have time to run a real expensive marketing campaign that ranges between comics, full motion videos, banners, and all sorts of other items that take away from the artists time. Furthermore, this 21:9 feature can be forced in to the game via a very simple "hack", which is solid proof that this feature can be supported very easily as it works flawlessly. Yet, Blizzard fails to respond to the community with anything that can be considered proper response. Secondly, the tick rate at which this game runs. It runs at 1/3 of what the MINIMUM should be in an FPS. Long story short, this makes your aiming inaccurate and destroys the entire concept of an online FPS. Nothing like being shot as you run around corners. Cheaters? Yep, Blizzard has no answer to those guys yet. While there will be cheaters in every game, they are running rampant in the games where nothing is being done, aka Overwatch. Lastly, micro-transactions. Something Blizzard kept quite on until launch (shady). While micro-transactions don't ruin this game, still kinda lame how you must pay more to get what you need, otherwise it is random. Remind me again as to what that initial payment went to?

Tl:Dr - avoid this game like the plauge 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoy dying over and over again to other players who obviously aren't anymore skilled than you... Overwatch is for you. The abilities each character possesses is overpowered. You will be rained on with spam since there is no ammo to worry about, just reloading. There are currently 21 characters in Overwatch, and the most effective teams use at most 3 of these characters at a time. Public matches will be filled with teams full of 6 of the same character and specifically the heroes that edge out at the top of the overpowered list. Characters without self-healing fall behind those that do. Watch streams of the best players. They die constantly. Skill in Overwatch is 100% negligible. Prove it to yourself.

If you're a casual FPS player this game will entertain you for the time you have to play video games, granted you aren't put against people who live on this exaggerated MOBA FPS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Remember the times where you were practicing to get better at Counter-Strike, getting a sense of the differences between the classes in Team Fortress, learning to bunny-hop in Natural Selection, getting a handle on the recoil of the guns in Day of Defeat, perfecting your aim with the rail gun in Quake or mastering the flak cannon in Unreal Tournament? During those times, do you still remember joining random servers on and on and on, hoping to find some equally skilled players to play with and have some fun? Yeah, me too. Good times.

But... you also remember joining those servers where you got absolutely bulldozed by a seemingly "too" coordinated tight-knit group of players. What was their advantage, you were thinking back then? Were they using a program like Team Speak? Maybe they were a group of friends playing together in the same room? Or maybe they only played this one map for hundreds of hours, using the same general tactics and you just stumbled on their server. Or maybe all of the above.

I remember I had a choice back then, I remember being able to choose for myself that I didn't like playing with these players, because there was no fun to be had for me. I couldn't hone my skills or perfect my tactics by observing them make the same moves every round, with the same weapons, with the same classes, in the same order, every single time. There was nothing te be gained on these servers. At those moments, I didn't realise the luxury I had of simply exiting those games and joining another within 10 seconds.

This game takes away that basic luxury.

As mentioned before by other reviewers here, this game forces you into games where the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate. Sounds good on paper, right? Everyone has a 1 in 2 chance to win the game. Sounds logical. You win some and you lose some.

But read that sentence again:  "the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate".
What this game does, it will disregard your personal and in game skill level and forcefully match you against players who are overwhelmingly more skilled than you, or match you up against a a seemingly "too" coordinated tight-knit group of players (which is visually indicated in your game) when you're on a winning streak.

You feel that cold chill yet?

Yes, this game willfully puts you in a meat grinder against individual top-tier players with hundreds of playing hours or clans of 3, 4, 5 or 6 players, because the game deems it is now "time" for them to win their next game. You are the sacrifice in achieving that goal. There's no way out of this circle. If you make the choice to exit this game, you will get a "leaver penalty" if you repeatedly keep leaving these kinds of games. When you join a new game, you will (again) get matched up against similar overwhelming odds. Until it's your "time" again to win and get matched up against a random group of lower skilled players.

It's maddening to play this game where the odds of you winning or losing are calculated and manipulated beforehand. In the end, you feel like you don't have any control on the outcome of the match.

In closing, this game fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow. From afar, the production values of this game are sky high. Excellent art style, good sound design, interesting characters/class mechanics, stable engine, etc. Yet their choice to not let you choose your own servers and the inclusion of this fixed matchmaking will be the reason many gamers will leave behind this game.

When Overwatch someday decides to give players the freedom to play with similar skilled players, you can up the score of this game to a 7.5 out of 10. There are fun times to be had, on the very rare occasion 2 teams of equal skill do get matched up against each other.

P.S.: Oh, and "Quick Play" in this game means waiting up to 3 minutes to start/find a game with other players. Remember 2 weeks ago it was publicized there are 25 million registered players in this game. Even if you look at that number from an extremely pessimistic view and guess that about 1 in 250 registered players still plays this game, you still would have 100 000 active players. It should not take 3 minutes to find you a game with those numbers of people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

God I wish I'd checked the reviews before buying this. After having played the game for some time, desperately wanting to like it, the best thing I can liken it to is an abusive relationship.

Sure you'll have fun. The characters are all fun and cute- through no small part of the cinematic shorts (which are free btw). When the game's at its best you've got a quirky yet high intensity class based shooter with a role for pretty much everyone. The introduction of new heroes is tied nicely into the stories they create and everything generally works.

But when you actually spend time with it, good god can it be just an awful experience. As many people have said this is one of the worst gaming communities to date, and as you fall in rank people are only going to get worse. There are some awful examples of design, such as if your team has a leaver- all of your team will lose SR as a result, you can be matched against a 5-stack as a solo player, and some heroes are objectively better than others. There are very few matches that you'll win by a slim margin: 90% of games are going to be total wipes one way or another despite your best efforts. The worst part is that because the game is so intensely focused on the teamwork, one loose thread can throw the entire game off. While sometimes it won't be anybody's fault (often it will be though) something won't mesh in your team- whether nobody can play a hitscan to counter a flying character (of whom is massively unbalanced at lower levels) or whether nobody wants to switch despite being countered, or whether simply your chosen heroes just won't mesh together- this can end a game and all the way up to around mid-plat (over the threshold of half the playerbase)   people won't have the skill or experience to be able to play the amount of heroes necessary with the correct degree of teamwork. It's not fun, as often matches are simply decided by the roll of the matchmaker. The exception to this is anybody diamond rank or above as more people will willingly change and adapt to help the teamwork, but this only accounts for about 10-20% of the player base. A lot of these problems would be at least bearable if there was some sort of fix on the horizon, but Blizzard haven't even sought to address the blatant and easy fix of having a leaver ruin the entire team's fortunes- let alone anything that would require more thought.

There's also the gripe of the game not actually having that much content for a fully priced game. While you can easily make up the hours (trying to convince yourself it's worth it), it gets very stale, very quickly as there are currently a total of 4 main game modes, with 14 maps. With all the new game modes that've come out it might be considered worth it but these are removed at the end of each event, meaning that instead of keeping the events in the game for some players to enjoy, Blizzard removes it meaning no-one gets to enjoy them. The game is also an online shooter- so the only single-player mode to speak of is playing with offline bots which is not reflective of the game at all as the bots will just stand around with only their aim tweaked to suffice for difficulty. While the online-only part is a fairly obvious part of the game, it just goes to remember that full-price games used to include both single player and online content.

In short it's probably best if you don't buy Overwatch. I'll admit I was suckered in with the free weekend and the cutesy shorts, but at the end of the day the only thing you're getting is an online game that is constantly being fixed, which is at the mercy of its own community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Few points for performance which is really nice... but the game lacks so much when it comes to actual content.

Every map feels just identical. People run around shooting and other team wins. Objectives differ but the combat does not, so it's just people moving a bit differently on different maps but apart from locations it barely matters.

Compared to CS which also has pretty stale and simple maps, combined with similar "just go and shoot", in that game you can actually feel like you have a bigger impact when you're doing well.

In Overwatch (and HotS) even the biggest "carry" in a game cannot make huge impact. This is a design choice that sure can appeal to some people who are in there "just for fun", but after a week of gameplay you just can't help but to uninstall the game due it's feeling of meaninglessness.

I'm not big FPS fan anyway and Overwatch doesn't make the game any better. It actually makes it worse experience because you cannot really feel much improvement even if you manage to land every single shot on enemy. Healing / tanks / ultimates just are there to even up the skillgap in already watered down version of CS where individual shots barely count.

This game has such a huge potential but I feel it's getting wasted by the "optimism" of the supposed critics giving this game far too much credit for what it really does, and it's ruined by the casual feeling.

I tried playing the competitive mode and after the first 10 games or so I got placed too high because apparently I was supposed to have an impact on a game where 5 people are holding objective with Reignhart or whatever his name is blocking everyone from getting damaged while my teammates keep jumping forward into the huge enemy fire.

This could be good game with well played team, but without a good single player experience you're not getting any recognition of doing well if you even can, because apparently there's hard counters to everything, so even if you'd manage to do well 1v1, some counter pick jumps on your back and slams you down.

Compared to some modern shooters where you have 4-5 roles, they are basically all with their own good skillsets, but they are able to carry their own weight and not feel super underpowered in taking down enemy.

In example Battlefield you got anti-tank units who can still take couple enemies down with rifle, but are mostly effective to blast those nasty tanks. Then you got medic who still is very effective on other areas but is able to give some healing and even resurrect. This is what good game design looks like. You got roles that aren't exactly anyones counters, but they manage to carry important roles in combat.

In Overwatch this kind of team composition is thrown out completely and replaced with heroes who go counterpick whatever you may take: Snipers get owned by ninjas and shields, some assasins who are close range get owned by turrets and so on. It just feels like the game wasn't intended for any real fairness of 1v1 taken into mind, which caused this game to become a huge **** of people just blowing everyone down without any real coordination and team who ever manages to get versatile setup usually ends up winning due counterpick mechanics.

Newer patches just added more counter picks and basically none of the real issues of rock paper scissors ideology weren't touched, making the game even less fun and more frustrating.

Get a better design crew Blizzard! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're expecting something that is of the quality of The Beatles Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Rock Band Green Day, or even Lego Rock Band, then don't buy this game. Vocals are broken. Overdrive doesn't work if you have the volume above conversation level. Drums lag and the bass pedal is not synced properly. The menus stutter and lag very badly. The experience is NOTHING like what you would expect based on playing other games in the franchise. Very disappointing. Don't buy this game until the developer fixes these problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have played wow for 4 years so far and this game made me dispise wow, i hated every aspect of the game with this expansion, i came to hit lvl 80 within the 1st week of relase and soon realized the content was awful let alone challenging no wonder the top guilds in wow beat all the new content in by the sunday following the release. the new pvp system is rediculouse picure a battle feild full of over powered characters and the only way to win now is to be the 1st to deal damage, skill is not a factor in wotlk for pvp. the only part i enjoyed was returning back to naxx again wich was awsome and the only reason why i didnt give it a  0 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played WoW since pre-BC times and i have to say it was pretty good then. But seriously this expantion just put me off. Yet again another grind to a higher lvl and then what? Raiding? From what i've heard the raiding isn't that great. At all. And yet again the xpac is very expensive. Just don't bother imo. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's just more of the same, where is housing, minigames, ships to own, dance styles, etc....? just more dungeons, more levels, more boreness 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

More of the same. Soon enough you'll be on your party mount in Dalaran, AFK waiting for something interesting to happen. That is, if you can't devote your life to raiding the ridiculous high-end content that only a minuscule percentage of the player base gets to see, let alone conquer. However, the game retains it's great environment aesthetic, one of the only memorable features of the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has shown to be one of the most played world-wide. Yet, the expansion reveals nothing but dull content and false advertisements. Hence the true example of over rated. As mentioned before the expansion, they stated there would be flying combat mounts in Winter Grasp, new dances, guild battlegrounds, guild housing, and many of the other illusions that could have been converted into actual content. Please, and be rational of what you're saying Blizzard. Although there are a few positives to this expansion, but as little as a rating of 2 must do. Although, with the previous 3.3 patch, questing and dungeons have made a slight smile to the fan base due to simple, reliable, interfaces implemented. Yet in comparison, they are speckles of paint versus a concrete wall. Of course you'll understand that some day. Again, I hope all the best content goes into Cataclysm as hopefully they've learned these lessons. But I would rather have them contemplate rather than take a GLANCE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is just another PaRappa the Rappa ripoff like Amplitude and Guitarooman and Leisure Suit Larry. Come on, PaRappa is almost 10 years old, let's stop trying to copy it. On top of all that, the characters in the game don't even look real. One of them is even the Grim Reaper... yay... that's cool... I guess.... if you worship Satan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

TL;DR: The stealth and non-lethal portions of this game are weak when compared to similar games of it's type. The mechanics are not as good as others of similar style. It manages to break suspension of disbelief multiple times. The mechanics of the game are in the way of the game itself.

I tried very hard to like this game. I put in over 7 hours of play time, so I did indeed give it a fair shake. It contains many of the elements I enjoy. Stealth, no need to kill, cool abilities, and the ability to slow time. Your actions will even affect the later parts of the story, and even the ending. Yet for some odd reason, I was quite bored. Playing the game in stealth & non-lethal limits you to just two weapons (one type of ammo for the crossbow, and unarmed choke holds), which means an entire part of the game is unavailable to you. Yet the game strongly pushes you towards non-lethal by giving you a happier ending, and future areas are easier the less you kill. So on one hand it punishes you for being non-lethal, and on the other hand it pushes you to being lethal. It's not that the story really encourages either, it's that the game mechanics do.

The graphics and controls very much felt like a console game. Many of the controls were very awkward on a computer to start with. For example, to slide you hold shift and w, and at the last second tap c. Sure it's a doable combo, but it's awkward. Sure, the controls can be remapped. But it's just an example of how the entire game is meant for console.

The stealth is not very realistic when compared to other games. It only takes into account cover, and not things like shadows. Enemies don't think to ever look up, so if you go up, the game is too easy.

Once you are spotted, you have very little options for non-lethal. So your best option is to run and hide, and try again, which is very much a "two steps forward one step back" approach. So instead it's best to just sneak around choking people until spotted, and then reload.

Overall the mechanics of the game very much got in the way of the game itself. The UI often times was disruptive. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a dear friend said: "This is the Frankestein of the videgames, it takes parts of another games (The Thief, Deus Ex, Bioshock) and does not do a serious story like those". I say: Many game makers just wait for sale success instead quality success. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is boring. skyrim is better than this crap game. plus stealing is boring and the story made me go to sleep. i don't know how this game got good reviews but please stay away from this game. please. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Para ser un juego de Bethesda deja bastante que desear, sobre todo después de ver títulos como Fallout o Skyrim.

Un juego lineal a más no poder con un absurdo sistema de lucha.

Una trama que no engancha para nada.

Muy mal Bethesda, muy mal =( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know why there is such a hype for this game for being something fresh and new. I bought the game in hope to finally find a good first person assassination game after it got so many good reviews. But again it seems like the review sites got paid to give it a high score, I couldn't play the game for more than 3-4 hours. The combat is pretty boring and dull, you get some spells and other features that just make the whole game easier than it already is, if you want a challenge don't use any spells and upgrades. The missions are boring, along the main story you get side quests that don't really give you any benefit. The game promises freedom and choices that have influence in the game, but the freedom they promise is pretty much if you want to run through all the guards to your goal or use the roofs or sewers, and the choices you make in the game end up to nothing. The atmosphere in the game has potential but the graphics ruin it, it would have been much better using realistic graphics than this comic stuff. The game is basically linear, getting easier with every spell and upgrade, and a dark atmosphere being ruined by comic graphics. If you played something like Deus Ex or Thief, don't buy it, you're gonna be disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a pretty game. It looks old, but artistic direction does turn out here and there. That's probably the best thing I can say. Everything else is just so incredibly, incredibly bland and dull that I don't know where to start.  Okay, let's start from the beginning: the story. You're thrown into it and from first 5 minutes (of which you barely understand anything besides plague and assasination), it's clear that story continues to be a experiment on writing a novel by a professional welder or truck driver. I literally had zero interest, let alone emotion as introductory part unfolderd. Next, steampunk. Now, steampunk settings in a computer game means usually 3 things: level design consists of pipes (excuse to be lazy), you'll be collecting cogs and scrap metal (why?), and third, whole point of thing is to avoid being creative and use conventional weapons and gear with some gears and cogs attached to fake unique look. It's all true with this one. Plus, steampunk always results in games that has story which falls flat, fails to be comprehensible or stops to be interesting. True again. To sum it up, it's somewhat pretty and incredibly boring first person shooter/Bioshock clone which I have no intention to complete, ever. Simply because I fall asleep after half-hour of a gameplay. Also, it's clearly evident that this is no PC game, even despite the port and very stable running in my experience. From general game mechanics to oversimplified combat and non-existent stealth, this game has nothing to do with PC gaming. I guess you could hook a gamepad to your pc and play it as a console game, but why in the hell would you want to do that? PC has way more first person shooters, which, for start, are GOOD. Dishonored is not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just avoid this game. The hype was unjustified beyond reason. Started the game on the Very Hard difficulty (the hardest of 4 difficulties) within 11 hours of gameplay I was on the second to last mission (had to check due to problem that will occur further into the review). This gameplay flew by the whole time I was thinking this has to get harder Im trying for difficulty but no matter what my approach, stealth or combat I found that nothing was an issue. Walking into a square with 12 people  took them all down with 1 skill didn't need a weapon or any of the other fancy things the game offered. The entire game came down to blink on them push attack cut their face off and repeat. Health and mana potions were beyond abundant. I always seemed to have all full potions full health full mana and an abudance of ammo and money. As I progressed getting ever more bored and distraught with the game, I reached a massively game breaking error. The 2nd to last level you do (a very specific thing) and are met with a cutscene this is followed by a loading screen, Every time the loading screen ended it would replay the same cutscene and go straight back into the loading screen after 14 hours of leaving it on to load and attempting to restart to try loading again I finally gave up. The games setting was nothing new and nothing else offered by the game made me even remotely interested in restarting in an attempt to get past that bug.

The game is extremely dissatisfying and should be avoided. Gameplay 0 - The stealth mechanics are shotty, the AI is hilarious in its levels of bad, the originality is non-existent, Combat is laughable in its ease, Character development is non existent as well. Insanely short!
Concept 1- The game offers nothing new just a mesh and swarm of everything that's been done before put into 1 game, the sad part is every game it is using as inspiration is longer and has much more depth to every aspect that was "stolen".
Sound 0- Turned it off within 10 minutes, music was dull and never matched the pace of the game, sound quality during all game mechanics was the same... time always slows down, blink possess, opening menus, using any of your powers, blocking, swinging your sword... they all had the same sound effect of time slowing down.
Play ability - 0 - Game glitched tot he point where beating it became a physical impossibility no game that does this will ever be awarded anything but an absolute 0 in this category. In addition to this massive bug there are little ones that I constantly noticed around the game. Things like getting shot by a guy holding nothing but a sword, or killing someone only to have their dead body kill you as well (death by cutscene into they somehow managed to shoot while you were ripping their face off).
Replay -0- I dont think I would ever replay this game, I couldn't be bothered to replay it to see the ending of it and the only other 2 people I know agree that its so easy on the hardest difficulty that there is no reason to replay it.

Overall .25 which will be rounded down because they lose 1 point for un playable game. If I could neg this game I would. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring and tedious.  Picked it up on a Steam Sale for $7.50 and I can't keep playing it.  Switching powers is a pain, the auto-save checkpoint system is kind of a mess (expect to go back and get runes again and reassign them to powers when you die before the next checkpoint), and the game is just not that interesting.  It's a burden to pick up and play, I didn't find it engaging at all.  The game looks and sounds good, but that's all.  The only game on the market today with rogue-like elements that nails it from alpha to omega is Assassin's Creed 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't waste your money on this game. The gameplay gets repetitive really quick, there isn't much room for exploring, the storyline is criminally short, and the moral choice system is extremely flawed. There aren't enough powers and there is little variety when it comes to combat. Also, for a game that focuses so much on stealth, there are surprisingly few non-lethal ways to take down targets: just choking and sleep darts. It gets old. My biggest problem with the game is that the only way to get the good ending in the game is to hardly kill anyone... which is boring and restrictive. And speaking of endings, this game has one of the most anti-climactic endings I have ever played. Very disapointing. Dishonored is easily one of the most overrated games of the year. Skip it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A game famous (and infamous) for its difficulty and vast open world. Sounds like a fun challenge. I'll readily admit that perhaps due to not playing Dark Souls 1 I'm missing backstory and plot points, but with all due respect...what the **** is going on in this game? It starts out and quickly makes no sense. Controls or wonky, but like most games, a person will eventually get used to them.  The inventory system? Not so much. It's confusing and awful. You collect items with little to know idea what they do, are presented with paths to take...that you shouldn't because the enemy on the path is far too strong for your character. Battles consist of rolling around trying to stab a bad guy a couple of times until you run out of stamina, or better yet, hope you can get him to stand next to a rock that causes the horrible AI to make him stuck against.  From there you can slice him through the wall...until an archer from across the map shoots you through the same rock wall. Wow.

Development is sloppy, unique terminology is not explained, the animations are so long, slow, and disjointed that you start something then literally watch the enemy perform 2-3 actions while you wait for your animation to finish. Let's say you bring up the menu-well, you can still be attacked with it up, but whatever. You exist out and can start walking around...but not of your attacks or rolls work until you exist out of the menu's menu bar that is atop the screen. Really?

Every step of the way lazy development and horrible game design prevented me from caring about what was going on, wanting to spend more time to learn, or give me any confidence that I was stuck in a learning curve that would end, and the meat of the gaming experience would start up.

Now multiplayer. Perhaps through poor research on my part, I was led to believe there was a traditional co-op experience in the game. What actually happens is after getting a few nonsensical items and apparently drawing on the floor with them, you can have someone else join your game as a shade. That means they get to see you run around and enable conversations, open chests, open doors, play the game, while you're along for the ride. Able to walk on ledges with terrible camera control and enemy targeting, swing your weapon of choice, then eventually run out of time in your buddy's world and getting to re-appear at a bonfire, you are guaranteed to feel completely cheated out of the story and gaming experience. That isn't co-op.  That's single player, with some small amount of interaction above watching someone's Twitch account.

This is in my bottom 5 of worst games I've ever played, and I've easily played through 500+ games.

Difficult? Yes. In the sense that it's difficult to ride a bike on the freeway with a missing tire, three pedals, and a blindfold, but I would argue the difficulty, and frustration, is due to sloppy development and horrible game mechanics. Exploiting bad AI and clunky animations is not cleverly difficult gameplay to me.

Update on the Update: Final Review

I am giving a final score of 2.

I don't play online and I don't look at Wiki's, I enjoy the challenge of figuring everything out on my own. I spent two hours trying to figure out a way to stop poison from flowing into an area. Fireball didn't work, and my +10 Flame sword did not work........but my torch did. Just plain stupid....fire is fire, if I can light it with my torch I should be able to light it with my fireball.

Bad graphics and fire/magic animations are brutal.
Poor hit detection, I get hit and lose most of my health but no sound or controller "rumble".
Visually I do not get hit, but I lose health. Full stamina button delays, especially on Estus flasks.
Some buttons flow and can "stack" but others do not.
Inventory animations looks like an early 90s RPG (Dark Souls Inventory Screen was perfect).
Balance issues, you have to be so powerful to beat bosses that the regular enemies are too easy.
Emerald Herald repeats herself every time, take away from immersion.
I subtracted a whole point for having to chase down Crystal Lizards, having them cornered but still unable to hit them with certain weapons.
Having to warp back to the Emerald Herald is a waste of time...I am over level 125....so over 125 warps and 125 times...seek greater souls.
After playing single player, I wanted to play on-line......I did not have privileges. Apparently need Xbox Live Gold....
Too much crap I will never use. I finally figure out the secret passage (or die 15 times trying to make a jump) to a chest and there is nothing useful inside....at least in Dark Souls the majority of the items you found were useful.

Like I said in my original review, if another company tried to ripoff the Dark Souls formula, this is what it would be.

Ongoing Sarcastic Comments:
I actually warped to the Drangelic Wal-Mart. Believe it or not but their plastic toy weapons last longer than my +10 Blacksteel Katana.
Drangleic, where magical fire from enemies burn you and only you. Friends of enemies get a little warmer but no damage.
Emerald Herald "I'll tell you what buddy, I'll stop repeating myself when you collect the right souls. I don't care if I have to repeart myself 130 times. And I am not going to tell you where to go either, all I know is there is a forest down there and..........tell you what, I'll meet you at the castle, what castle you say?

In Drangleic sometimes you take one sip or two sips of your estus flask. And sometimes not even at all.
Drangleic, where only some of the environment is breakable. Massive support pillars yes, brown metal boxes...not so much.
Drangleic, load up on VIT so can finally wear that cool armor and die in two shots anyways.
Obviously the same company that built the walls in Lodran are the same company that built Drangleic. "You see this wall here? Yup, specially made so enemy weapons can slice through it like butter! Player weapons, no way Jose!!"

Drangleic, where ladders are home free for the enemies.

I get it, its supposed to be tough and challenging. But there is a difference between tough and challenging and something that becomes dull and repetitive having to try the same thing over and over again. If I wanted dull, repetitive and challenging I would go to work.

WTF? Usually a sequel enhances what made the original so good. Not here. Feels like a totally different game. Every change is for the worse. Feels more like Fable than Dark Souls. Graphics, combat, character models and movement and overall pacing and experience is off. Whoever forced these changes at FROM SOFTWARE should lose their job. Don't let this garbage define Dark Souls. My recommendation (for old and new players, alike), go back and play Dark Souls 1. Every detail is DS1 was done with care. This thing... like I exclaimed, WTF.  Score: 2 (compared to original which I would give a 10). What a disappointment.

A third person fantasy game, where It pushes you to it's limits.
Pros:
Graphics are a nice touch.
Sense of danger. And basically feels like your stuck in hell and the only way to get out is to kill everyone in front of you, and if you die, you try again.

Cons:
No real story.
Bad voice acting.
Unrealistic gameplay and stamina use.
Lifeless world and NPCs.
Bad facial animations.
Unrewarding. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Un jeu sans âme, une suite sans idées et assez moche, bien ennuyeuse, un titre faussement élitiste. Bref, ça n'arrive pas à la cheville d'un Skyrim par exemple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overrated garbage. An additional cash grab by Capcom. SSFIV is essentially SFIV with some additional characters and modes. Something that should have been included in SSFIV - this should have been a game addon. And to add insult to injury all characters are unlocked by default. Capcom could have done that in the first place (in SSFIV). Hard to believe little innovation can garner so many points from the pro reviewers. As far the overall game - SFIV and SSFIV are designed strictly for the hardcore gamers who have also invested in decent fighting stick. There is high learning curve for the novice player to fully enjoy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a very complex game with great detail, but you know there's something wrong when right out of the gate, they're telling you all about God mode - and you'll need to use it, because the simulation breaks every few hours without making adjustments for when things go wrong and the game errors out.

It required far more time and patience than I was willing to give it, and after 4h, I was still unable to figure out the results of most of my choices. Feedback is very weak. Both the games I played through, I was stopped because my team had weak leadership and I couldn't figure out how to resolve it. Leadership is not a stat which was ever presented to me. After some Googling, you're apparently supposed to look through players bios to see who likes to play pranks, because they're leaders and prevent bad team chemistry. ??? Bad feedback systems.

Actual baseball games lack any excitement, which is about how I remember real baseball. You're there to improve averages, so games don't count for much given how many there are (the primary benefit of micromanaging games is it sort of helps you understand how numbers translate to play - but again, feedback is very weak), and once they're boiled down to a fatalist game of probabilities, it feels particularly hollow.

I've never encountered a game demanding I do so much observing and testing for such great lengths of time for so little mechanical information. -But it's the best sports simulator I've played, by far, and it reminded me a lot of the fun I had when I was using NREL's System Advisor Model, given they have a near-identical GUI. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's more of the same. I expected better from Retro. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most people like games because of gameplay, graphics, how hard it was... but this game is hard to get into. The first level involves running around with virtually no direction given, and the second is worse, as you have to look for several keys with even less direction. Funnily enough, if you could save whenever you wanted, it might get a 3, but it screws that up too. You have to backtrack all the way to your ship to save. No thanks, this game is strictly for Sci-fi nerds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maan...dont waste your money!  The controls are a disaster, which ruins everything about these two games.  I played the original ico and shadow of the colossus on the Ps2 and the controls were much tighter than this disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the funniest games I have ever played The humor was very funny from The Great Mighty Poo to the games many 4th wall breaks. The characters are also very funny and entertaining I also loved the games music. My favorite song was of course Sloprano featuring The Great Mighty Poo. But this game has A LOT OF FLAWS. I got Conker's Bad Fur Day using the Project 64 emulator. I would not recommend this version at all. The game was very glitchy and at times prevented me from moving forward. I encountered a major glitch from the beginning game when you have to hit the Gargoyle with a frying pan instead of cut scene playing of the Gargoyle falling off the bridge it instead flipped upside down. To fix this I had to play the game all over again. I also experienced a glitch with the poo cabin in the poo themed area the cut scene didn't play and I was trapped in the room and I had to restart the game all over again. But the biggest problem by far with this game is the game play. This is the hardest game I have every played in my life. The controls on the computer work poorly for this game which adds to the difficulty. The enemies in this game are too powerful. A prime example of the games difficult AI is the Tediz controlling the turret in the War Chapter he fires millions of bullets at you and it is a 70% chance they will hit you. It was so bad that I couldn't get past it so I had to use a cheat to unlock all the other chapters and scenes. I was able to complete the rest of the game using this but this inconvenienced me supremely. I also hated the entire War area in general because it was very hard and frustrating because the shooting controls were poor you had to hold down one button to enter the shooting mode and one to fire which made it really really hard. There was also a very poor escort quest where you have to use Rodent as a shield and his AI was very poor. But by far the worst AI in the game was the rake in the Barn chapter. You have to make him hit the hay without him hitting you but the problem is that he just like the Tediz has laser pinpoint accuracy. The big catch is not his laser pinpoint accuracy but the fact that he somehow misses the hay almost every time. But by far my least favorite level in the game is when you have to race a bunch of caveman. The race is extremely difficult because the game expects you to have twitch reflexes and if you hit a wall or any object other than chocolate you explode and have to start the race all over again. Conkers' Bad Fur Day is a hilarious game with witty dialogue but suffers from extremely poor game play. What I don't Understand is how IGN can give this a 9.9 out of 10 which is game clearly doesn't deserve the only reason why this game doesn't have a 0 is that I was able to beat it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, this was a dissapointing game. I mean, if you're into art games like thatgamecompany's previous games, "Flower" and "Flow", you'll love this. Otherwise, don't bother paying the outrageous price of 15.00 for this hour-long game. Also, while the art style and music make up the 2 points i am giving this game, i have to say that the gameplay is just not satisfying enough, and the multiplayer element, (where you see another player with no gamertag or identification) while a cool concept, is utterly strange and not used to it's potential. Overall, one of the most dissapointing games of the year. I quite enjoyed Flower, but this was just another overhyped game that as another reviewer said on here "seems like a religion". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After all the hype, when it's all said and done this is a terrible game. The developers tried to pull a Shadow of colossus or Ico kind of presentation but they failed miserably. The game itself is pretty but oh so simple and boring. As for the co-op all you do is watch other people doing their own thing. What a joke. and the game is so short it's not even funny.If you want to play games that are surreal and beautiful you're better off getting the Ico and Shadow of the colossus HD release. I can't believe sony made such a big deal out of this mediocre title, flow was good but not this. There are some great games coming out around this time and you should spend your money on those instead of this drivel. I'm sorry if my review is harsh but almost everyone is making this game out to be so much more than it really is and I can't stand it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Очень скучная игра. Не понимаю, как в такое можно играть и для кого она сделана. Провал 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sinceramente não sei o que as pessoas viram nesse jogo. Ir de um lado para outro, sem nada mais o que fazer.... Gráficos bonitinhos, e nada além disso. Um lixo, não compre! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bien sûr, il faut se replacer dans le contexte et graphiquement (on parle de la PS1) c'était fort joli. C'est la seule espèce de "qualité" qu'on pourra dénicher en fouillant méticuleusement un tel étron, si on espére y trouver quelque chose, cela va de soi. Ce jeu est l'ambassadeur en Occident des otaculs et autres **** ceux qui se déguisent et dont la cervelle dégouline par les oreilles sirupeusement.

En effet, on y retrouve la quintessence de la japoniaiserie et du prétendu jeu de rôle ; prétendu, car il n'y a rien de rôliste là-dedans (un inventaire et des points d'expérience ne suffisent pas...). Prétentieux, niaiseux à souhait, débordant de mauvais goût artistique, FFVII est par ailleurs dirigiste et sclérosé par des mécaniques de jeu bordéliques et bâclées, la faute à des choix de design balourds et non assumés. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Indeed, I can't agree with Chris P. any more. People call this "the best game ever", and I honestly cannot see why. Alright, I'll hand it to you, it has good music, okay graphics (the regular animation was pretty icky, but the fmv's were pretty nice for the time), and a mediocre badguy. But, the plot was weak in many place, and the character development was terrible. Cloud has the personality of a rock, and when it comes to RPG's a game may be better looking then the rest, but if its story clunks, then it will never pass for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been playing since the SNES version and this is EASILY, by FAR the worst Mario Kart game I have ever played.

- Impressively, the AI cheats more than it ever has before. In every other Mario Kart game I could lap  the other racer with ease, in this one that is simply not possible because of the absolutely insane level of rubber banding. Getting 1st place is often down to luck due to the absurd amount of cheating the AI does; the amount of times I've been screwed over literally seconds before the finish line is beyond counting. Not to mention the much more blatant cheating I've seen, such as items going directly through defences I have prepared, blue shells ignoring the racer in 1st place to go for me, I've even seen racers teleporting ahead.

Well, at least there's online mode, right? Wrong.

- Online mode is completely and utterly ruined by several things. Firstly, it allows you to use cheats. That's what I'm calling 'smart steering' because unless it's a map with great, hard to access shortcuts then it is effectively cheating and there is no real disadvantage to using it. Remember the fun of playing on maps like Rainbow Road in the past and laughing as people fell off? Those days are gone, as it's impossible to do so now.

- As usual Nintendo fails to offer basic online functionality. Want to play in 200cc races? Too bad! You have to randomly search for a match and it will often be much slower. You want a balanced match? Too bad! There is seemingly no matchmaking whatsoever and people with triple the average rating of the match will be in the race for no good reason. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With the 3ds version, this is the worst entry in the series! What a piece of garbage! I loved the first 3 games but this one is terrible. The single player is empty: No adventure mode? No break the targets? The new modes are all mediocre and they even managed to mess up classic mode! Tons of useless characters were added: Wii fit trainer, Villager from Animal Crossing, Dark Pit (basically a useless clone), Pac-Man (seriously Nintendo?), and taken away some awesome characters from Brawl (Solid Snake and Ice Climbers come to mind). The new stages (except the Skyloft stage, that was amazing) are unoriginal. This game lacks creativity heck there isn't even an intro unlike the first 3 games which all had incredible intros. The use of amiibos is pointless and boring and the DLC is stupid: Corrin and Bayonetta are overpowered ruining the game experience and WHY IS RYU IN THIS GAME HE BELONGS IN STREET FIGHTER! Do not get this game it's fricking crap! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Guess I too am in the minority on this one - i find it boring. And I love a variety of games - inc. all the civilizations. Perhaps thats it - the fleet graphics are cool, but its a bit too confusing and just too long and just not that fun - plus it takes forever to play - shelfware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as I wanted to like this game, it was far too easy and the AI very insufficient and easy to manipulate. I could win every game easily with any victory condition I wanted. There were some good points. Being able to design your own ship was a big plus, and the tech trees were good too. The beginning was challenging, with trying to get your race profitable before your starting money ran out. But apart from that, not much else was good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a really great game, but the Xbox 360 port is really bad, with huge FPS drops that make it almost unplayable. Worst part is that developer Telltale Games ignored all complaints about the FPS giant problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where's the game?  This is essentially a choose your own adventure comic book.  The format was tired in the early 80s with Space Ace and Dragon's Lair and it's no more enjoyable today 30 years later.

The story is engaging but the pacing is terrible as it stops while the player tries to solve a puzzle.  The game is non existent, limited to finding and using items in puzzles that a 5 year old could solve and mashing buttons in QTEs.  We are a looooong way away from the cryptic imagination high of Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island.  The much hyped "real consequences" are smoke and mirrors.  Choosing who to save and who to let die has no real consequence, the game keeps on going and presents the same puzzles and story in the next scene.  Player choice is rigidly restricted and often what the player wants to do and would choose to do in that situation is not presented as a choice so they are forced to pick an option which doesn't resonate with them emotionally thereby reducing further emotional attachment to both characters and story.

They should have released this as a non interactive mini web based series like The Guild.   If you want a fun zombie game with an emotional response, play Left4Dead and read the wall graffiti.  Now THATs how you tell a story without sacrificing the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the most over hyped game ever.  In fact I can't even call it a game.  It's a movie where every now and then they make you hit a few buttons.  Sure the story is alright (sub par when comparing to the writing of the show) but at the end of the day that's all it has going for it.  I found myself slogging through it just to get the achievement points and was completely sick of it before episode 1 even ended.  This sums up the game formula perfect, cut scene, click on everything on the screen, cut scene, repeat those steps dozens of time until the end of the game.  I "played" the last couple episodes while doing other things like browsing the internet, that's how unlike a game this crap is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How anyone could rate this game higher than a 3 is beyond my meagre ability to comprehend. It's incredibly buggy on all platforms. It has high requirements despite having poor quality graphics. The characters in it are beyond moronic. The drama is forced to the point of complete farce. The actual gameplay is atrocious and almost random in its application and you have zero real choice in anything that happens despite the wondrous claims of Telltale (a telling name if there was any). The sole redeeming factor of the series is the artwork and animation. The people who gave this Indie GotY were either paid off or smoking crack. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't like this game due to its linear story line, and only story line. No matter what paths you take, you will ALWAYS end up doing the same thing. After episode 2, your saved games are wiped for some reason.

"Beautiful hand-drawn style" Seriously?? Its a piece of crap. Not even lips are synced half the time, and some models aren't even models. They're just drawn on textures 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't see what all the hype is about.  This game is hardly a game but more of an interactive movie.  I like RPG games alot, but this game is weak.  It's really only and RPG in a very minimalist sense.

Even as a movie goes it's rather bad.  The acting, dialogue, and plot are cheesy.  I didn't like the characters either.  They're rather cheesy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst FF in my book. Annoying characters,  boring world, way too melodramatic sappy story, way too slow and boring gameplay. The music isn't all that great either and the imagery just falls apart all the time-way too many eye burning colors on every character and place. The whole thing is like a japanese soap opera with a japanese pop star as a main character+ some magic summoner stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm late to the game with this one, but it's pretty clear that this isn't really a video game, per se. It's more like a long, drawn out anime. I quickly grew tired of mundane tasks, like having my character walk from one cut scene to another. There just isn't enough real interaction to make this a video game, unfortunately. I will say, the cut scenes are beautiful to look at, but when it comes down to it, I could see a beautiful anime by renting one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is one of the worst JRPG-s to this date, and worst FF game. Storyline is stupid, characters are annoying and underdeveloped. Main character is a whining brat Tidus who joins a group chosen to stop great evil monster Sin. Story also just stops at some points and you do stupid quests for random people. And those last for app. 10 hours. Final boss is also a slap in a face to every person that finished this game. Gameplay and battle system is much better than previous games and there is a full voice acting for every cut scene. But voice acting sucks and cut scenes cannot be skipped. Basically this game is horrible and very, very overrated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remembered seeing this every where ten years ago so I pulled out my old ps2 and paid $3 for a copy. And for all the perseverance I had, all the hours I put in trying to get quality back out, this game might be one of the most disappointing endeavors of my life. The story is god awful; the relationships are rote and simple; there is absolutely no thematic development; the only good song out of a horrendous soundtrack plays maybe twice; the villain might have the worst cliche name in gaming history; but possibly by far, the biggest, most torturous, agonizing flaw is the voice acting - it might have been decent in japanese but the american actors gave no effort, only stretching out insignificant dialogue (which was poorly written to begin with) with complete lethargy, or yelling through the pseudo dramatic moments. It may aspire to be a dramatic story but it fails miserably in every way possible. The gameplay is alright for a FF game; it allows for decent strategizing, but be aware that the only wit involved in FFX will have to be on your part because the creators had none. If you play video games for stories foremost, avoid, or better yet go out of your way to break copies of this if you see them lying around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've now completed the game and have to lower my score for this game from 3/10 to 2/10.

Some, but not all, of the problems with this game are:
1. Trial and Error is the only way to beat some of the later levels.
2. Clunky controlls, especially for selecting spells on the fly.
3. All bosses can be killed with the same strategy.
4. It doesn't matter if you are a good or bad player, having good mechanical skill will only hinder you.
5. Only 4 of the spells are useful.
6. Only 1 of the armors are useful.
7. Only 2 of the unlockable Abilities/Attacks are useful.
8. The bosses are the easiest part of the game because of the horrible level design.

Pros:
1. It has a nice story, but it's predictable and short.

Conclusion:
Would not recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jumpman, Super Mario World, Commander Keen 4 Goodbye Galaxy, Prince of Persia, all classic platformers.

This is a bad platformer that shamelessly steals ideas and tries to pass them off as it's own.

I found it incredibly irritating, lacking in charm, and just plain repetitive. Plus it wasn't the least bit fun to play at any stage. Yuck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has a beautiful atmosphere and story.  It really does.  Unfortunately, I simply did not enjoy working my way through the various puzzles.  I just found them to be so unbelievably tedious, and only managed to put about 2 hours into this before deciding to move on to games that I actually like playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The epitome of pretentious indie hipster games. There is a decent puzzle-based platforming game here but the ending really soured the whole game for me. PoP: Sands of Time did everything this game did but better and 6 years prior. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward to Fez, but was very disappointed. The game is extremely simple, with few puzzles worthy of the name and virtually no challenge. I didn't finish, put this back on the shelf, regret buying it.

BUYER BEWARE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awfully short for the waiting time. Nothing new, and incredebly noobfriendly.

This is the original advertising campaign. "Half Life 2: Adventures of Gordan Freeman and the Crappy Unnecessary Character: Part 2" By now, if you actually enjoyed Half Life 2 up to this point, we can throw just about anything at you. How about? The same puzzles. How about? One new Enemy with slightly updated AI. How about? A storyline that actually requires you to study and worship Half Life to sort of understand. How about? More awkward situations to the point of unrealism. How about? The final, not boss, Bosses be very overly complicated to defeat and leaves room for hours of frustration. Now we know how much our fans like the same old formulas. So, get this, we actually make it into a package deal. With one, count them, one good game in the package deal. Its called Portal or something....us valve teammembers are against games that make you think but we'll let this one slide. We can't call it something generic like "Valve Fanboy Package" we'll make it the "Orange Box" which is like the mating call for all Valve fanboys. I hope you come to enjoy our repackaging of Half Life 2 as much we enjoy half a**ing everything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the biggest waste of $15 ever on XBL (And I spend a ton of money there). I love portal. But this is just new levels stacked on top of the original game. there is absolutely no humor or that macabre humor. This should have been sold on XBL as a level pack for $5 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No replay value, a good rent, that is all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I honestly cannot understand a hype around this game.
It is a very, very simplistic game. It's neither a competent scroll-shooter, nor a worthy puzzler.
The side-scrolling "runner" sections are laughable.

Please behold a classic "hype-train" situation, when one lazy reviewer starts a tendency and the sheep follow.

This isn't the BEST Vita game. By no means. It is ridiculous to rate it over Atelier, Soul Sacrifice or Final Fantasy X. Get down on the Earth, people. You just ruin the competent top-lists with such ridiculous scoring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think It's a overrated shooter. You really need to like that type of game to enjoy it. Glad it was free on the PSN. But I like the graphic. They force them self to have a story line and, in my opinion, it's just slow the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very BAD game that is just puzzles! MATURE gamers like me and the Youtubers I watch like to shoot and kill people in games, not do puzzles!! Puzzles are for kids, I play MATURE games like Fallout and Battlefield!!! Because I dont get this game and it doesnt tell me what to do and I cant shoot anyone I am giving it a low score!! Learn from NINTENDO if you want to make kids games and tell me what to do with screaming Toad tutorials, dont just drop me in!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's very repetitive... eg the Ocean King's Temple ... give me a break... fancy graphics, etc do NOT make a good game. RENT IT and save your $$. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring movement throughout the world map, dungeons that a toddler would solve easily, gimmicky control failure, and going through the same dungeon a gazillion times? This the Zelda game you'll wish you DIDN'T buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is based on one giant gimmick. It's an unoriginal idea. The producer of this game should just quit now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are you kidding this game had no depth. hardly any story. I found it oddly boring. The last level was great, had the whole game be like that I would have given it a 6 or 7. Still I was dissapointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They could have done so much more with this game! They're out of their minds for just sticking you in some creepy lab for the whole game! They RUINED an amazing concept by doing that. it would've been awesome if there was even some team combat against the administration in the lab, but nothing! I mean think about it, it would have some awesome strategy if you could use the portal gun in battle; you could appear right behind somebody and take em out! If I made something like this, I'd make some CTF levels and make people use this gun for something, rather than just go from start to finish in a series of tests. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

for what was a very creative and fun game series, fallout NV and 3 set an all time low. Sure, fallout 3 and NV pulled the series to 3d and open, and i admit it was kind of fun, but that fun was ruined by the major bugs, freezes, glitches and crashes i experienced on my copy. it happened on my PC,ps3 and 360 copies so its not my system. This is a very crap game that does not deserve a sequel. If 4 gets made, it must not be developed by obsidian and not use that crap gamebryo engine. I cant even tell you how bad the DLC makes it. Its unplayable after 3 hours gameplay. its like it purposly freezes to tick you off! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know where to startâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know this is an old game but boy was it terrible. Go here do this... go here get that... I hate fetch quests and this game seems like one big fetch quest... I bet the story is horrible... I gave up... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

my god this gaym suks so bad UGHHHHTEA AND CRUMPETS ON MY PET WALRUS upside down in space communicating with giant flies- bad game poor gwafiks 2short no multiplayer just not gud enuff sowwy :/ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If being god is this dull and boring, he'd have to shoot himself. this is the only game I ever bought that I was not able to advance past a few missions, for the sheer pain of playing futher. thinking of the possible obligation to play the game in light of buying it was like doing advanced accounting homework: wishing for a break; dawdling the time; picking up other things to do. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible repetitive shallow garbage through and through. If you look past the graphics, a child could program a better game than this in BASIC in one hour. You can test the trustworthiness of a review site by checking what they had to say about B&W: the ones that praised it played it for a few moments, tops. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is nothing compared to fifa 09. It is not smooth. It is just a roster update. I do not have fun playing it, and I am enraged that people think this is a good game. I don't get it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Defensive AI will play like a U11 team unless you are on World Class, and then the CPU offense is too good for all but the most serious FIFA player. Physics still has a way to go to match PES. CPU teammates will ignore the ball if not from a pass or cross (shot deflection will roll right by a CPU player and they will show no interest). Still no resolution to the auto-switch problem. Too many bugs to count, especially in Manager Mode. Lounge Mode is still not hooked into the player sign-ons. At least they added a training mode (try to find it though!) and fixed the throw-ins and most goal keeper issues. It's amazing to me that game reviewers write glowing reviews of this game year after year seemingly without digging deeper than a single match and no knowledge of the Beautiful Game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Prepare to die alot, and be bored while you do it. Its highly repetetive and gets old very quickly. I dont see myself playing this game again anytime soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What I love about small and independant developers is that they often have new ideas and a will to make something unique. When I buy their games I love the idea that I can expect anything to happen when I push the play-button. When I bought Spelunky I thought the idea of randomly generated levels would be that "anything". That one idea could easily have carried a whole game by itself if developed properly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, so was not the case. Instead the game seems to consist of a number of different ideas that each have been proved to work elsewhere. Put together in a way that none of them are fully developed or given the chance to really grab my volatile gamers-attention  in the end the idea of the randomly generated levels just seems like a "by the way".

After playing Spelunky for a while I'm left with a feeling that the game feels eclectic. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It feels like the game is trying be a lot of things but ending up not fully being any of them.

I would have given 8 points if i could play it on my speed like i want like Isacc but i give - 6 points for this stupid time limit!

If there at least where an option fr puting the time limit off but so..... i dont like to play it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nice looking, for start  but gets repetitive on the matter of level design, visuality and purpose  Fails deliver any  surprises, and it fast turns into no more fun.   I did almost come give positive review after first minutes of play  but too soon my feelings changed to a thought  This was it  .
yep that was it.  Theres luckily better games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry folks but this is the most overrated game in history,. Fifa still doesn't succeed in offering a realistic football experience. I've been playing it since Fifa98 and I have fun doing so but that's fun as in Tekken: it is what is: PRE DEFINED ARCADE MOVES! NOT FOOTBALL WHATSOEVER... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has potential - but it is ruined by the unhelpful **** EA and the insane amount of scripting they put into the game. Online, the opponent gets lots of lucky deflections, your defenders act like mental cases and you can't do anything about it. The servers troll you, too. Every game that I win I get disconnected, but I am still logged in to XBL or PSN. Offline, you watch as the CPU rape you by walking through your defence, getting lucky deflections and then proceeding to cross the ball really fast to the attacker who acts like a ninja to score. But then, I tried putting CPU vs. CPU, they suck, even on the hardest difficulty! Why EA feel the need to script the game to hell I will never know. This is the worst FIFA for a LONG, LOOOONG time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is poor! I got it as an unwanted xmas present and initially rated it a 5. Now I've had time to play it, I'm rating it a 2. Why? I believe this game is a MASSIVE step back from previous versions of the game! The tactical defending is rubbish! Ok, you can turn it off but its so not needed! Attacking is a complete joke! You're telling me to beat defenders you have to do all these fancy flicks, twists, turns, step overs, chops etc etc again not needed! Have the devs ever watched REAL football matches.... these things rarely happen unless you're Ronaldo or Messi..... it so un realistic its untrue. And thats its downfall; they have tried to make it realstic they have actually made it unrealistic and unplayable! The controls are so sluggish and laggy too. The through ball is a joke.... it never goes to the intended target. I swear their players must have telescopic legs! Just when you think you ar through.......... NO intercepted again! Passing never reaches its intended target about 25% of the time! Shooting is a nightmere! Always goes wide or hits the bar/post whatever....... its just bad!
The game is just poor! Thats another thing why are my strikers always on the half way line?? WTF?? They never push forward! Its crap! Games crap and I hate it! The last fifa game I actually bought was fifa 10 and I loved it.....this version is crap! I'll be putting this game on ebay today! Save your money, games broken! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed with fifa12. It feels like EA have tried too hard to improve a near perfect fifa 11. I was a massive pro evo fan until konami tried to "improve" things, then I moved over to fifa, now it seems EA are  doin the same thing. Fifa 12 feels sluggish, speedy counter attacks are near impossible and the new tackling system is totally unrealistic. EA need to have re-think on what makes a game fun,  because fifa12 isn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

GTA: TLAD is the most disapointing thing ever. Now just like IV the characters are the same the story makes no sense at all, when you heard that a new GTA is coming out you were thinking "How bad can it be,  it can't be worse than IV, I mean you play as a biker and do everything you did in IV". Yeah until you played the game and it blew you're mind, no Im serious you went straight to the guy who sold you the game to get you're money back and an extra few hours that you wasted. TLAD is in fact worse than IV but its not the worst in the series, like Yoda once said "There is another". 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another attempt to cash in on a cheap tacky game, everytime I tried to boot this game up I was greeted with a long period of unreponsiveness, when I do get to play the game I find myself playing something from miniclip.com.

Gameplay is same old flash style gameplay, graphics are the only thing worth mentioning about the whole game. It gets really boring very quickly and no matter how the graphics change and the scenary varies it doesn't make the gameplay any less repetitive or yawn-worthy.

I give a 2/10 purely because it looks good but I wish I could get a refund as I would accept it in an instant. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the Paper Mario series thus my reasoning to buy this. I first found it to be fun and new. But as the "mini games" started to pile up and I started to get into the ridiculously boring "monster" battles. So to take a break from the hundreds of boss battles, I went off exploring. But that was boring too. I found myself moaning and groaning as I moved on. By the time I got to the giant robot fight I was done. Too mentally burnt out to play. I was just that sick of the Mario Bros doing mini games in Bowser and Bowser taking part in horribly boring battles. I just didn't care to beat the boss and move on to even more redundant battles and bloody mini games. Just not my cup of tea. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG ermmmm can sum one pleez tell me wot dis lame piece of a cr@p is meant 2 b?  graphics look like theyve been chucked 2 gether by a 3 year old, and sum of da trix r retarded like da one where u do a manual wit 2 boards???? im sorry but where da hell does does da other board come from??? AND there is no change wat so ever 2 da other tony hawks, truely dissapointing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Homage to old school games or rip off? This is just another repetitive, boring platformer. Plain and simple it's nothing special, it just takes from every old 8-bit game. Not worth the $15! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is everything a retro game shouldn't be. The only retro feel it gives is the lack of tight and precise controls.  When you win or lose based on control scheme, that takes the worst part of games pre-90's and shoves it down your throat.  There are MUCH better retro games out there. Trust me, if you are under 50 don't waste your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is dull, boring, and nowhere near as good as everone claims. I had it for a week then sold it on e-bay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a huge FIFA fan and FIFA 12 is almost a good game.ALMOST.Who in the world would think that letting the player control the GK in online modes would be a good idea?It's a HUGE exploit. Just press Select and watch the CPU doing your job for you.So now, playing online means: Your opponent will only attack, the CPU will defend for him.A HUGE mistake, EA. HUGE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is absolutely brilliant...if you support a top flight team. FIFA appears fluid and outstanding. But as a supporter of a team in a lower league, FIFA becomes completely unplayable. Passes go wayward, shots from mere yards go flying wide. FIFA has tried to become the most realistic game, and has failed miserably. I don't remember going to watch a low league football match and not seeing one shot on target. Unless you play on beginner mode, you are going to find little luck trying to build your way up in career mode. Buying new players is equally impossible. Budgets are pitifully small, and completely unrealistic. A League 2 football club has more than Â£12,000 to spend on players. As I said, this is a great game if you plan on staying as higher league clubs, but dare to go lower and it becomes unbelievably poor. What happened to FIFA of the old days when stringing 4 passes together was possible? This game is a shadow of what it was, spoiled by an unrealistic target of making it true to life. I do not want to play a realistic football video game, I want to play a football game that is fun. Until the fun element returns to FIFA, I feel it will continue going downhill. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what a waste of money, the worst fifa game i have certainly played, i feel the graphics are the same as fifa 09 and i prefare and still play fifa 11, absolutly terrable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks! What a waist of time and money. I have never seen such a lame azz game. Whoever was the brains behind this game should be fired. Play Metal Gear or US Navy Seals. This game is a complete waist of effort. They took a good franchise and killed it. They should have stuck with what they did in 2. Now the AI is the worst I have ever seen. Online play has gone from playable to unplayable. Battlefiled Modern Combat is way better than this silly crap. Save you money for a real game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game just doesn't do it for me. It has a lot of potential but I can't stand to wait for 15 mins. just to get into a game. Not sure why they couldn't use Halo or SOCOM's party styles. Oh well, it looks pretty though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great graphics, great sounds, awesome intros. But the gameplay couldn't suck more. AI is a step 15 years back. Your buddies are as dumb as carrot sticks. Enemies are unbelievably mechanic. Basically there's no AI. The characters just sit there and shoot you, or they pop out of the corner every 3.23 seconds, and your team gets shot and does the same 3.23 second delay when it hides around a corner. It's a sad sight to see such awesome graphics wasted on this non-existing gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good Lord, what a dull game. It's as though some Latvian programmer played Myst about 30 times and decided that everyone in the WORLD needed to experience his own particular, peculiar fantasy universe. News flash to Latvia: gamers want to *do something* in the pretty fantasy palace--not merely walk around, pant, and stumble into lame puzzles. It's astonishing how this ever got released. Do yourself a favor: do *anything* else but play this game. Hitting yourself in the head with a mallet softly and repeatedly will produce the same effect as playing Ico, but is likely to be cheaper; and more interesting for your friends to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a fantastic game, one of the best games of the year! Good story, lead character, open world is evlolved beautifully and immerses you almost instantaneously, gameplay is pick up and really enjoyable! What's not to like? Oh, and the animals are the best designed and 'brought to life' you could want in a game! Loved it so much, I platinumed it, and not many games grip me for that long! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So me and my girlfriend bought this game to test it out.
The game throw you right into action, which is not that bad, abit to rushed though.
The game is filled with action, but kinda repeats itself alittle to much.
you have about 41 different kinds of animals you can "slay" and use for different kinds of crafting meterials, some of the same animals like tigers that clearly is different, but have the same kind of skin disappoints me a little..

Missions and side stories are in general ok, but some is REALLY frustrating compared to the rest.

The game focuses alot on doing stuff around besides saving your friends, which makes little sence to me, your friends are freaking captured, if you gonna save them, whats the point of activating radio towers while your friends are held captive?

ANYWAYS, the game really focuses on rushing you into things, give you small thrills and hypes during intense moments, but the controlls and how you move around, doesn't quite fit in.
if this game was supposed to be given to someone as a gift it would mainly be because you hated the person and wanted them to suffer abit.

We also tried to check how the Multiplayer for online worked, and we used quite a while to even find out where we had to click to join eachothers, you didn't even get up a notice on "you have an invite" or "Person has invited you to play" nope, you have to go on multiplayer - Multiplayer - Friends - The friend that has invited you - accept invite...
and people quick joins so fast that its mearly impossible to freaking join your friend.. which really sucks.
couldn't they just have made the same system as Call of Duty? you get a mail in your inbox to join a friend..
atleast that was simple and it worked.

sorry but it won't be a high grade from me on this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nice graphics! I like the anime inspired characters.
But:
No single player; no campaign; no story; no progression; no goals; always online.

It's got to be a free-to-play, right? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So disappointed by this game considering it was a lot of money to buy! For a game with no single player campaign and okay multiplayer content, it is just simply not worth the money! Expected much more..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, Overwatch is a great looking game.  However, it's 2016 and most games are pretty great looking, so there are no bonus points for that.  Basically, this game felt like a remake of Timesplitters 2 for Gamecube.  It's a cartoon shooter that has two game modes that get boring very, very quickly.  I bought this game on a Friday, and returned it on a Sunday.  Do yourself a favor and get this one out of the red box before you buy it.  If you're really in need of a shooter, Star Wars Battlefront is down to 40$ and blows this game out of the water as far as content and play control goes.  Having 25 characters is great, but none of them are really fun to use.  I for the life of me cannot understand what all the hype about this game is for, it's very below average. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is decent at best. It's just a glorified objective simulator that every other FPS games have been doing for decades. It has almost no content with no single player campaign.
Think of Street Fighter 5 with even less to work with.
If you enjoy games like team fortress then this is right up your alley.
It's enjoyable for a few hours but at the end of the day you'll be begging gamestop to stay open so you can sell your copy back to them 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you rate this game 10,then i sorry for you.You shoul play team fortress 2 and battleborn instead.This game have no content:
No Weapon process
Only one mode
Boring after a while
60$ for box with skin.I mean wtf!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is fun. The way a free to play competitive shooter is fun. But Blizzard is selling their characters stories, style and backstory which are not in the game. The videos and trailers are awesome, love them. But the game is a full priced game $60 for a few maps, a ton of random characters and basic shooting, no upgrades, no levels, no progress, nothing.
I should mention that it's very smart and balanced, the way each character plays very different from each other, but putting the videos and the brand aside, the game is just MEH. Not worthy of it's score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I originally had a positive review for this game but things made me drop the score.
1) my internet is great yet I keep DCing Blizzard wont do squat
2) Console version gets pretty ignored.
3) Toxic people EVERYWHERE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here are the reasons for my negative review.
1) Monsters take the same damage no matter where you hit them. no weakness, no reason to try to attack them from behind. You just stand there in the same spot and button mash.
2) I truly believe that a skilled player in any game should be able to avoid damage. however, no matter what you do here, taking damage here is inevitable, even with the ability to dodge 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What sold me this game is the notion that it may be a similar experience to playing as Rexxar in warcraft 3:the frozen throne(which was damn good).I thought that I'd be getting a big world filled with all kinds of insane secrets and interesting dungeons,coupled with a rewarding loot system.What I got instead was a huge,but barren,world,combat that is nothing but pure button mashing,and a loot system that constantly throws **** your way,making it feel completely irrelevant.You can barely explore the world without doing the story missions,which is a complete turnoff for any action rpg.Speaking of the story,it's bland and generic.I was so disinterested that I just skipped through all of the dialogue,wanting to go explore a new area,hoping in vain that it'd have something worthwhile.You could jump on me that I'm judging the story without getting to know it through the dialogue,but look,a good game with a good story would get me interested and I wouldn't have skipped the dialogue.The same goes for the rest of the game.Uninteresting,haven't finished it,and that's for a reason.I wasn't intrigued,I wasn't having fun,that's it.If you'd for some reason want to buy this game,buy it on PC.It just looks more suited for a PC than for a console. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible writing, ten tons of visual noise, can't be rescued by the decent combat system. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has awesome ideas and feels like a step up compared to other Devil May Cry-clones. Too bad it's sexist, stupid and has the worst story I've ever experienced. I was absolutely disgusted with the cut-scenes and felt like taking a shower when I turned it off. Never to play it again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Japan really needs to stop doing the same thing over and over again. This game feels like I should have seen it in an arcade 10 years ago minue all the camel toe. I am so confused by the high ratings, is this a joke on me? If you are an 11 year old with no access to porn this is your game, otherwise stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The movies between levels and between the parts within the levels were long enough for me to jackoff to the long legged chick with the tiny head but I hardly got to play the game. Even after I cleaned up she looked so hot just walking around slowly and everytime I did a combo her costume came off so ofcourse I started jacking and the bad guys killed me. Poorly thought out game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok it looks ok but just face it the XBOX is just not made for first person shooters. the controls are just plain shit and the graphics are compaired to the pc just sub standard. FPS and RTS belong to the PC where they can be done correctly and the XBOx should just stick to platform and driving games this goes for the PS2 also. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The thoughts going into the Cataclysm expansion were good ones.  There was an intention of customization and letting people play how they wanted to play.
What came out of beta and was shipped and then patched was nothing like what was promised.  Stat customization went from an optional cool thing, to something that was just plainly required because itemization went down the drain.
The talent tree revamp flopped.
The raid content flopped for the most part.
A lot of pvp content that was supposed to come in, never did, and got pushed into MoP instead, and the stuff that should have come out in MoP is not coming out.  That is to say PvP content that had been around in files since the Cataclysm beta were never utilized and instead just recycled for a later expansion, which they have no context in.
Blizzard has become quicker to do knee jerk nerfs, but now waits years to fix any problems they create in their knee jerk nerfs.  Druids are a case and point in this expansion, early on they were doing fairly solid all around, average players stayed in the middle of the pack while playing the class, and awesome players performed awesomely, instead of the druid class' usual performance where average players perform sub par and good players may just barely make out ahead of the middle of the pack.  Blizzard's methods for remedying this change in performance were to put mechanics into the class that removed key talents and abilities from toolkits thus severely nerfing you no matter what you did.  MoP is showing the same trends in dev behavior.  No they can't be reasoned with to be shown the errors of their ways, they just dig in deeper when you prove them wrong.

The amount of content put in this expansion is the smallest amount put in any iteration of WoW to date, and all for the same price (for you) as previous iterations.  This also isn't a trend that doesn't seem to be going away or getting better, but instead getting worse in the upcoming years.

Yeah, I could write a short novel on all of the downfalls of Cata, and the problems so far seen in the next xpack MoP.  I can't do that here, so just walk away with the knowledge and suggestion to stay away from WoW until next year at the earliest, maybe the end of next year to check up and see if anything has been fixed, and the devs have gotten a few humble pills so that way they stop thinking they can treat their customers like crap and still charge full price for less than half of the content advertised. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe i went back to WOW for this, i left after i got bored with Burning Crusade thinking Cataclysm would bring dramatic changes, but it's just the same old crap, boring questing.

I've played Guild wars 2 for about 10 hours and already had more FUN then the 3 or so years I've had in WOW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WoW is a great game, but this is not a great expansion. The storyline is really boring and Deathwing is very impersonal antagonist. In BC and WotLK the antagonists were very well known and loved Blizzard characters: Illidan and Arthas.
Also the overall style of the expansion is rather cheesy. The new Thrall seems more like a coward than a legendary orc hero.

Some of the new areas indeed look nice - but because they're split all over the world there's not really a nice connection between them like in the two earlier expansions. And there's not a main city which would serve as a whole server's meeting place and a place to hang out.

To sum up, the Cataclysm was a huge disappointment. The original "Warcraft-feel" is gone. The storyline's not interesting anymore. BC and WotLK had a lot of influences from earlier Warcraft-series games, such as Warcraft 3. Cataclysm doesn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was a hardcore WoW player since Vanilla. I was a GM of a top 10 raiding guild on my realm. For over 5 years years i have loved this game. Gosh, all the good times we had! Especially killing the LK on 25man, that was fun! However, Cataclysm made me stop playing, and to eventaully close my guild and cancel my account. I hate the class changes, the new trees, the new dungeon lock out modes (10 and 25) and overall, the entire game has become more like a job than enjoyable. Good luck all, I am out! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst expansion in wow history, Broke off my addiction and I must thank for that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First let me get things clear. My first impression of Cataclysm was great! I loved the new zones and some of the quests were really fun (i even did the new Hillsbrad quests on my lvl 85 and they were really fun). However after a month of playing you realize that you are doing the same thing you have been doing in Wotlk. Grinding for gear and money. The changes to raids and dungeons are minimal (except for more CC and added difficulty) but nothing really new.Now say this game was for free (buy Cataclysm for 30/70 euro and rest is free) this would be a great game. But the current content is just not worth paying a monthly fee for, especially if you have already done most content in Wotlk, Cataclysm is just more of the same. Blizzard had a real gem on their hands with WoW but it is really showing its age. WoW Vanilla/BC/Wotlk were great games and really fun to play but Cataclysm just doesnt cut it anymore for me. The reason i gave this game a 3 is mostly because i think its just not worth the 13 euro per month + 30/70 one time fee. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm writing this review late after this games release. But, since I played it it deserves an opinion. First off the Original WoW was amazing, truly a work of art game. Burning Crusade was even better and another great success, but then comes Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm... With the games increasing popularity lead to a decline in the player community being filled with Trolls, greifers and elitist jerks. Also Wrath and Cata are poor in comparison to the previous versions. What makes Cata worst of all is Blizzard tried to squeeze more juice out of old lemons. By that I mean they took the old version and recolored it, including OLD dungeons forcing you to replay what you already had before for loot. Plus, doing Heroics where the wait time is 30minutes+ is unbelievable.... what am I suppose to do for 30 minutes? pick my toes and if I afk while i wait it drops you from the Que! This is ridiculous and is a LAZY excuse on Blizzards part. Further more Blizzard haste to be the most money hungry developer out there currently pioneering the way for $60 games with Star Craft II. I will never buy anything from Blizzard again. I also will add I cancelled my account 8 months ago after years of playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

World of Warcraft: CataclysmAverage User Score: 5.610World of Warcraft: Cataclysm ImageEven before this expansion WoW started to feel as if you were being funneled into where they wanted. With all the options of characters and things you can do I cant help but feel I'm being forced to do what Blizzard wants you to do. The free world experience is lost. Everything is too structured now, dumbed down. The rebuilding of Azeroth seemed completely pointless, new content very insignificant. To me it feels like a money grab, an opportunity to bring in more players and increase the player base but at the same time alienating smart people who know better. I was a DAOC veteran, thus have a high expectation in terms of a MMORPG. I like complex items, complex skill system, and true character customization. I feel as if Blizzard is limiting many options and streamlining everything in order to make WoW more mainstream. I enjoy things like Open world PvP. I like the ability to become a lone wolf and scour the land for an opponent like the old days of DAOC, but in wow it is very structured. It feels like the "facebook game" of MMO's now. I am severely disappointed in the direction they have taken WoW because they have in my experience worsened the experience for smart players not enhanced. WoW is now a game for kids, as an adult I feel it is embarrassing to be associated with it, and more of a liability. Plus the Wow world is getting very old very outdated, there is a reason their making a new MMO....aka "Titan" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not the best of expansions. The game is focusing more on the hardcore players, and making less content for the players that dont have 20 hours+  a week. Disappointing if you ask me. The world remake was good no doubt, and the quests are funny, but end game content is too time demanding. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I *may* still be a WoW addict, but it seems less likely by the day. I haven't even downloaded the 4.1 patch. Why? I'm bored. Cataclysm revamped all the old world zones, redoing most of the quests! Cool, but they also made it absurdly easy to fly through them in a bare minimum of time. Why spend so much effort on giving the leveling process a facelift, only to be done with it so quickly? There is this persistent rush to end-game, and when you get there... there's very little left to do. Particularly if it's with the same character you've reached end-game on in previous expansions. There are achievements! Got 'em on my main, minus a fair bit of the ones requiring a raid. I really have no desire to get them again on another character, just for the sake of having them. Dungeons! Heroics! Have all the gear I can possibly use for an upgrade from them... on 6 or so toons, and their offspecs. PvP! Okay, really. I *know* Blizzard is in a constant struggle to balance PvP, but I just don't see it ever actually happening. Ever. Happens I have few-month-long moods where I really want to PvP, so I do it anyway, balanced or not. Well, since the massive battlegroup merger, and the faction changing for a fee thing, my beloved Horde *massively* outnumbers the Alliance. This leads to absurdly long queue-times for battlegrounds, and the inevitable sitting in Orgrimmar, waiting, that goes with it. Gets a bit old. Raids! Yes, I enjoy raiding, but you can only raid so many times per week. What's left? Professions? I have all of the professions maxed on various characters, except for archaeology. Which, as another reviewer quoted, involves staring at a stick with a blinking light, and *massive* amounts of travel time.  /Yawn. So, we're left with leveling another character... again. Well, I've definitely got that covered--I have two accounts with max character limits on one server alone. Leaving me with absurd things like 3 priests, and 2 lvl 85 prot paladins, etc. Why? Well, not counting the fact that it's about the only thing left to do, I actually *like* leveling. Well, yay, there's new content for leveling up to 60. I've done all the new quests, on Horde and Alliance toons. It goes by too quickly, and I just end up with yet another 85 that I can't bare to delete, but probably won't play very often. As for the whole concept of "cata dungeons are hard!", they were moderately difficult initially, especially in comparison to the ones in Wrath, but, last I was playing they were easy mode again. Really, the dungeon-finder hp/healing/damage bonus is nice, but with 208k hp (with that bonus) and good avoidance and mitigation, I really didn't need CC any more. Yes, you still have to do appropriate things to compensate for various boss mechanics, for the most part, but it really had gone right back to "tank grabs a group, we all kill it, next!" from Wrath. For a little while, there was a hint of challenge. Now I don't care if you're hitting my target or not, I'm not gonna lose threat to you.  That's just the tanking standpoint. With two accounts full of toons on one server, I *do* do other things, and I'm still bored. The new zones are interesting the first time through. Vashj'ir added in the element of needing to look above and below you, instead of just around you on a plain, but it loses its shiny luster of newness rather quickly. Most people find the zone pretty, but annoying. I only know of two people who don't hate it. The constant chain of cinematics in Uldum is an interesting twist the first time through, but after that, it's incredibly annoying to try to skip the cutscene, and find out you don't get the quest update, and have to go back and actually sit through the whole thing again. Also, an annoying facet of questing in the lvl 80-05 zones is that, with the ability to fly in the old world, the new zones were designed for you to fly in them. That doesn't sound problematic at first, but it massively affects mob spacing. You kill one mob, and then run just a bit too long to get to the next one, or you have to mount up, hop a short distance in the air on your flying mount, and then kill the next mob. Over all, the content is visually appealing, in the same WoW style, but the "new" parts get old pretty quickly. That's a gripe I have about the game as a whole, actually. Content gets outdated *fast*. Sure, you can do a Vanilla raid at lvl 60, because you can actually zone into the raid zone, but good luck finding other level appropriate people to do it with. Everyone wants to zoom through them on 85s. For luls, I soloed most of Kara shortly after Cata came out... on a holy priest. Sure, it's got the amusing "look what I can do" factor, but like everything else, it loses its appeal rapidly. If you don't mind using WoW as a giant chat room for weeks on end while waiting for major content patches, then you won't have a problem with Cata. It's pretty, but it's nothing truly new. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First impressions are 10 out of 10.  That is the reason so many critics rated this game so high.But after your first month of play, you will realize that nothing changed.  The end game is identical to wrath of the lich king.  If you were hoping this expansion would add something new and fresh, you will be disappointed.  Nothing has changes at level cap.  If I could, I would go back in time and skip this purchase.

Blizzard did a good job revamping the entire old Azeroth but Cataclysm isn't fun at all, to be honest, it is quite FRUSTRATING.Heroics are much harder, which is fine because that's what Heroic means, but it gives those casual players that queue in the Looking for Group system a terrible experience since they will probably not be able to finish one single Heroic dungeon with Pick up Groups.The worst thing, however, is the new profession Archaeology. It's all about random number generation, yes, pure luck. Things that relies on insane random numbers will create a terrible injustice situation: A very small amount of players will be getting rare items by doing just a couple of "solves" (this is how you create an item via Archaeology) while a huge amount of players will be trying to get the same exact item by doing the same thing over weeks and yet they might never get the item. There is no sense by doing this since Archaeology is certainly the worst professions, it is time spending and not fun at all.It is quite impressive that Blizzard's staff is composed by the greatest game developers around the world that have enough time to develop games and their mistake on this last expansion was just insane as others failed grinding MMORPGs out there.If you are a HARDCORE player that don't think about anything other than playing World of Warcraft, this game is just for you.Don't play this game if you think you also have a life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously, this game needs complete graphic engine update. I do not understand why Blizzard do not invest money in this direction since apparently they have all possibilities to do so. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is getting old and you can see it in front of your eyes, it does not have the fresh feel when you play t, last 3 years were a disappointment. Blizzard is rapidly loosing money and getting overwhelmed by other MMO's like Guild Wars 2 in the future. Not worth the time playing it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cataclysm represents the end of the road for me in World of Warcraft.  Blizzard has finally removed any and all challenge from the game. Leveling my pally from 80 to 85 was a joke as it was impossible for me to die.  There wasn't a single quest that gave me a second of concern.  After getting to 85, I began leveling a worgen warrior and, being unable to heal myself, I did die a few times but only at the lowest levels.  Once I got some half-decent gear, leveling became a dull, dull grind.  My guess is that Blizzard decided that with Cataclysm WoW would no longer be a game for adults.  Their focus must be on 8 to 10 year olds.  I can't think of any other age group that could find any hint of a challenge in the game.  Yeah, yeah, yeah - lots of new quests and the graphics, while still a bit cartoonish, are very detailed.  The overhaul of Stormwind is pretty amazing.  But Wow isn't a game.  It's nothing more than a way to kill time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a hoot this new expansion is. For those Wrath players, just patch up and enjoy the grand majority of the (not very good and reasonably buggy) content for free. For those people who are still on the fence about WoW, just don't bother. BC and WoTLK were great additions to the game, but Cataclysm is the equivalent of taking 40 dollars and burning it. "If we can't reuse it, we won't bother" - Blizzard 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

High on my list of reasons why I quit WoW, this expansion just took the cake as far as nerfing things to placate incompetents and dullards. Absolutely nothing was a challenge, or if something was it lasted for about a week until Blizzard got round to nerfing it. Anyone who suffered through the indignities of Wrath and Cataclysm and is still playing the game either has incredible staying power with lost causes (Perhaps they`re all from Scotland) or at least one serious mental problem.

The only positive innovation I could find was the inclusion of rated battlegrounds, which were great fun while my ill-considered final WoW subscription ran its course. But who subs to an MMORPG to play RBGs? I know I don`t, and everything else was total trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Perhaps the best game of basketball.but a great blunder, so removing the 2K11's online ... only 1 years ago.So I can not put more note. this is a joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First impressions: game is WAYYY over rated and pretty much sucks. Honestly i can't understand why so many praise it? It is full of serious glitches, dumb objectives which give you very little info and time to achieve plus sometimes i will be hanging around without knowing what to do and absolutely no info - then i quit, restart and bam, it begins with an objective. Super stupid. Plus the map is crap. Very very disappointed and i'm starting to hate most Ubisoft games. Should have kep my money for MW 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely terrible in every way. The graphics look like they're from an original xbox and the controls are awkward and use difficult timing. Missions are repetitve and the game is slow throughout. The original assassin's creed was much more fun and engaging. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Single player is rubbish.Multiplayer is rubbish.Graphics for 2003 game: oh my god how bad they are. Half life 2 and Doom 3 came half year later, look their graphics.So: sp 2/10 mp 2/10 graphics: 1/10 sound 2/10 musics 5/10Sorry CoD fans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I read the reviews and they were all good for Mario Kart DS. I thought that it would actually be a good game, since the DS doesn't have many fun games. I got my DS about a year ago and I got it with a game, Metroid Prime Hunters, which I didn't enjoy playing. I haven't touched my DS for about 6 months and I thought this game would change that, but when I got it, it was very dissapointing. The graphics are pretty bad. The handling for the cars is impossible to get used to. The sound is repetitive and I ended up playing with the sound off. This game has only a few tracks, and they got boring after the first or second time I raced on them (One track held my interest for maybe five races though). After a day of playing this game I am afraid to say that my DS will begin collecting dust on my shelf, until another game that looks fun comes around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Talk about false advertising! I saw this game on one of ant and decs adverts being a big fan of ant and dec and britains got talent i presumed it would include stars from the show like susan boyle and paul potts but no all it has was some stupid italian steriotypes and poorly designed side characters Also this game is incredibly anti enviormental! oil spills are treat as if they are a good thing! not to mention all the fumes from the cars honestly what sort of message is nontendo trying to give! do not buy this for you or your children it is downright terrible who wants to play as some guy called mario or luigi they dont even have number 1 hits! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was one of the first mario kart games I played and it did not entertain me all that much also the graphics suck and it really is bad game.In other words the worst game in the series(Mario kart 5) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Deleted the game after 2 missions, bad puzzles like teaching you how to use a PS4 controller, no excitement in the game, not enjoyable at all.  Don't bother buying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is incredibly boring; you spend 2 hours flying as a petal which takes more petals until you make everything pretty. It's barely a game, and while it did stir emotions towards the end the experience felt shallow. It has absolutely no replay value, and there are far better ways to unwind. Looks pretty, but has no substance whatsoever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game does NOT look like the one that was advertised. Google-search 'Dark Souls 2 Graphics Downgrade' and you'll see that we've been totally mislead on what this was going to look like - through screenshots and videos. It's a good game otherwise, but this isn't the game I dropped a 60 dollar preorder for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not sure why everybody is calling this a true RPG experience.... There is a very weak or non-existent storyline. There is absolutely no immersion and no NPCs, no towns, and no interactions besides fighting. It's ultra linear and while props should be given to how challenging the game is, most of the time it's just a timing thing. You study how the enemy works by dying a few times, then time yourself to dodge, block and strike. Different enemies, different approach. It will be the same from start to finish. Boss fights will take alot of time but feel so satisfied after bringing one down. The combat is not fluid. It's just doesn't feel natural. Your character is like a skeleton. Without any meat. I dunno.... Something like that..

The world is boring and you will feel alone all the time. Online component, almost non-existent besides some hints dropped by other players here and there. No co-op. So forget it, Your character doesn't talk. The music is like it's not there. And the graphics are quite bad to be honest.

Not the worst game I've played. But it's just same same same. From start to finish. Demon Souls, Dark Souls 1 and 2, Bloodbourne.... All the same with little to no innovation..  The new Dark Souls 3 is going to be same thing I bet. But hopefully I'm wrong. Hopefully. So to sum up, one word - boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I went into Far Cry 3 with high hopes. I was let down very quickly. From the start you are thrust into the story with nothing leading up to it. From there, you are presented with clunky, choppy, BORING gameplay. The story is good and the visuals and scale are amazing, but these things do not make up for the severe lack of things to do in the game outside of the main quest. You have various side-quests but none of them are any fun. They boil down to "go here, kill this" or "Find 2 of these, bring them back." The gunplay is awful; no gun feels like it has any weight to it and they all sound the same, as if the developers copy and pasted the same sounds into each assault rifle. The number of guns you have to choose from is a joke also, not until the last few hours of the game do you actually get more to choose from but none are any good and they all sound the same. This game is riddled with bugs and glitches. Everything from floating enemies to animals that teleport all over the place, it seems as if this game could have spent a little more time in development. Anyone thinking of buying this game...DON'T. This is a solid rental at best. The game has 0 replayability. I regret buying this disaster of a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've heard of Far Cry. Never really played it before this one. So I figure "what the hell," and me and the missus hit up Redbox.

We get home, throw it in the Xbox, and fire up the rig. The game starts, and ten minutes into it, we are both saying, "What the hell is this mess?"  First off, the graphics are less than stellar. Choppy as hell. Looks like individual animations are randomly plopped into the environment instead of integrated. Second, the sound is TERRIBLE. The pirates' voices sound like something from NES days. And we aren't talking bad sound from flat screen speakers. We have a 7.2 surround system and it STILL sounds like ****

Third, the pop-ups in this game are ridiculous. More often than not, games have useful pop ups on the HUD. Not FC3. The pop ups persist until they are cleared and they take up an unnecessarily large amount of screen space.

The "crafting" system is mediocre. You think that you'll be building upgraded equipment, better armor, etc. What you're really doing is collecting items of value (skins from various animals, plant leaves (really?)), essentially gathering money to buy a bigger inventory bag or have more space for ammo. Essentially the crafting system is an entire quest system reminiscent of quests from WoW. Uh, no thank you. I can't comment on the Co-op or the multiplayer, because I didn't even want to try that nonsense. Now, I really wanted to like this game. I had read pretty good things about it. But, at the S.O.'s insistence, I rented it first. Thank god for that. $2 instead of $60. This game does have a few nice aspects to it. The game world is literally wide open. Oh, except if you're doing a mission, then you can not go out of the mission area. Seems a little dated to have mission areas or mission boundaries in an open world game but whatever.

*Minor Spoiler****** The sequence when the main character gets high off of the shrooms is fairly entertaining.

Overall, this game lacks a lot of features we have all taken for granted. Do yourself a favor and rent it before you decide to buy, or at the most buy a used copy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

interesting if not the most intuitive requiring you to go through. On exhausting series of menus to do anything but it was worth it I thought it was only one minor hiccup on the road to my favourite game in years. After some hours with the menus though i started to see a frustrating trend, for some reason everytime you went to the menus to craft, save or anything else the game felt the need to connect to the ubisoft servers? You might not think it is much but it took about 20 seconds every time and when you're loading up that menu 5 times minute when your hunting and crafting vigorously you are ready to throw your controller through the wall! And the campaign is the good part of the game!    The other three parts of the game only nosedive in comparison, and when I mean nosedive I mean into the side of mount everest. The co-op me and my 3 other great friends were ecstatic for, finally we could team up against the forces of the island!! So we all logged on and the problems started back there, trouble logging on, ubisoft servers were apparently down for half of us while in one case it said my friend had somehow had parental settings blocking him and kicked him off! After about 15 minutes of everyone trying to host a different game, rebooting xbox's and yelling and frustration we all finally joined into a match, we were ready. As we played through it we found the missions really fun and skill testing as infinite waves of deadly enemies poured forth from the corners of the jungle trying to thwart us in our mission. We fought blood tooth and nail to keep them back and we barely succeeded, together a massive sense of accomplishment as we beat one of the hardest battles we fought on any game and as it went back to the menu we were jumping for joy when we realised the mass amounts of xp we had hoarded through co-op. With glee we watched our levels skyrocket from one to fifteen in an instant, weapons, armour and equipment were ours but as we checked back it said our ranks were stil rank one.... the whole game glitched for all of us and we lost everything we worked so hardto achieve, to say we were aggravated is an overstatement, bloody oaths of turd flinging the ubisoft offices were abound as me and my friends lost there minds. After that we found out this is a reoccurring bug that happens every time you play unless right after OCCASIONALLY your xp will be there if you play a multiplayer match or you load up your profile. For all the connecting to ubisoft servers all the time the ubisoft servers have yet to show any sign of decency or competence.    To sum up multiplayer is to say it has a great class customization system and a great idea and engine but the connection to everything is horrendous. About 300 ms ping on every game I tried, making it nearly impossible to play. Every time you try to leave a match in the menu before its even started takes about half a minute, overall all I can assume is ubisoft is playing Lego's in there offices while elephants with projectile diarrhea and operating the server room. A game this day in age and with a reputation like far cry should really have this streamlined by now to either work in the background or be instantaneous like everything these days, to say this game operates like an shoddy beta that has never been tested is 100% true. It makes me sad.  Now on to the map editor, now let's forget that ubisoft put maybe 10 minutes if that into thinking how they could improve upon the map editor and decided to just port the old far cry 2 one over with smaller maps, Lets forget that you can even play custom maps in a custom game, and let's forget how infuriating it is to do anything in this mess of a **** game. You are left with a map editor that has a favor amount of tools and promise to it, maybe I can make new maps to play with my friends and there is an easy way to keep it always new and changing! Yeah no, first of all they give you the option to use vehicles and A.I. bots, as well as place weapons down but if you EVER want to publish (play) your map then all these wonderful features are not allowed to exist, so what is the point of even having them!?! In short far cry 3 is dissapointing, period

After hearing about the problems the first Dark Souls game had on PC, I put off buying it until I knew that some of its problems had been fixed by the developers or modders, or that there certainly wasn't going to be any further improvement. I was disappointed to find that it only showed the XBox controller buttons in place of the keyboard commands and it took some rebinding to get keyboard and mouse rebound to a functional set-up but I was ultimately treated to a fantastic game. The atmosphere in Dark Souls, as well as its environmental storytelling and bosses were all phenomenal, and I've sunk many long hours into the game.

I've therefore been waiting with a great deal of excitement for Dark Souls 2. Dark Souls was a rushed port in response to high PC player demand so some problems were expected, but surely there wouldn't be any with Dark Souls 2, which was developed for PC simultaneously ... Wrong! The Xbox controller prompts are back. The default bindings are appalling, and many keyboard buttons can't actually be bound for no apparent reason. The controls are laggy in a game were rapid responsiveness are key. There's also the more minor issue of the massive downgrade in the lighting of the game, which hopefully may be fixed at some point for PC.

In short, this is once again an embarrassingly bad port, and I'd advise waiting for fixes from the developers or modders before getting it. What I've played of the game itself seems great, but it's simply not a finished product and I object to being sold games in this condition. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I still remember how frustrated I felt when the first Dark Souls came to PC, and it was THE worst port I had ever played on pc (and I have a long history with BAD ports). Luckily for me, there were a bunch of fans that fixed the company work for us gamers without asking for a single penny, so I ended up enjoying the game I had bought (half of my money should have been to those guys who fixed the game), and I remembering me thinking "they wont do this again, right? The backlash was pretty hard on them" well yesterday I bought this game (the sequel) and I'm already feeling like I will need those guys who fixed the first one again! Really?. For starters, it doesn't initiate if I have my controller plugged onto the pc, it just crashes, so I cant play it with my controller (not that I would like it but, It's the recommended way right?), amusingly enough, it doesnt seems to matter if I have my nostromo plugged into the pc or not (I tried unplugging it, plugging it with the controller, plugging the controller alone, etc) and guess why it doesnt matter? because it doesnt recognize it. So that leaves me out with traditional keyboard and mouse, so ok. I try to start the game: CTD!, try it again, CTD when I first move! I'm starting to have a Deja vu from the first game (which had several graphics problems that luckily those fixes from those saviors fixed for me, which made my game CTD), so I use Nvidia control center to deactivate several graphics options (rather force them) and the game stops CTDing. Yay! Who needs graphics, right? well turns out the controlls are a damn mess. Better than the first one, but not by far. So I end up getting really pissed and as a result I come here to warn people that if you buy this and have the astonishing luck that it works like intended, you will have to deal with camera and key binding issues that will have you dead not because the game is difficult, but because you will feel paralyzed by the control system.
So, I'm planning to get a refund on this garbage and move on to something better from another company, a company that doesnt have his fans fixing their games for them... Oops It seems there are none of those nowadays. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing it for more than 100+ hours combined through Steam & other means of playing it I can safely say that it is terrible & it will always be terrible. The game itself griefs you in its overall design. It's like, that **** at a party who's just there to be an **** He wants to make you have a bad time, piss you off & **** your girlfriend while you're tied down forced to watch. That's pretty much DS2 in a nutshell. A hard game for the sake of being hard & an **** for the sake of being an **** **** this game in its entirety 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I heard from friends that Dark Souls II was pretty good - and the metacritic scores were pretty good so I bought a copy, downloaded it on Steam and found that it's basically unplayable.  The tutorial says to hit buttons that plainly don't do anything.  It says to hit "A" and I hit A and it does nothing.  I finally figured out how to open a door but then it says to hit "B" and that does nothing.

I am completely perplexed by trying to play the game... it's like it's broken.  The mouse works ok, and I can move around like I always do with W, A, S, and D but any sort of move or action doesn't actually work at all, and I can't figure out how to do anything.   I've spent some time reading reviews by users and apparently, it's all using the console controls - which is ridiculous.  It's a PC game sold on Steam - PC's come with keyboards and mice.

I don't understand how it's even legal to sell a game which doesn't work.  I'm going to try to get a refund from Steam... but since I've never heard of anyone getting a refund on Steam, I'm thinking that I have a hard struggle in front of me... but likely easier than trying to learn how to play Dark Souls II on the PC.

I'm totally disappointed and the company should be embarrassed that they released this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

PS - To Bandai and the paid for marketeers flooding this site with reviews.  You might want to pay for native English speakers first.  If your going to do it then at least make a proper effort. Then again, at least your consistent with your scam of a game as this probably took about the same amount of effort to create as some of the pidgeon English reviews they have been posting here and elsewhere on the net.

The first portion of the game is a long intro in which your mean to create your character.  Unfortunately being an utterly **** console port (one of the worst I have seen) it is unplayable for me as try as I might the game will not recognise the letters on my keyboard so I cant create a character. Simply gives character unrecognised errors for everything.  This in itself is not so bad if I had not been ripped off, spending 50 Euros on this terrible example of just why console games will never be as good as something designed for PC specifically.  The field of view and aspect ratio during play is absolutely awful making it look like your watching everything through a small slot like a postbox.

So I sent a message to Steam where I brought it.  Despite UK and EU statutory law concerning sale of goods they sent me to Bandai.  Bandai just do not respond at all.  So not only did this game cause me to drop it, it cost a long term relationship with steam as well as they treated my with utter contempt for asking me for my money back ignoring the fact that the contractual relationship for sale of goods is between us.  Passed it to the consumer protection agency and they are dealing with it.   Also passed the story on to UK independence party campaigners to use if they see fit to indicate how corporations ignore EU law.

There are claims that the game is beautiful etc.. Well, while your looking through that little slot it is a bit hard to tell as your characters arse takes up quite a lot of the screen real estate and there is little room to gauge how nice it might look.  The quality of the art work reminded me of the witcher 2 but the field of view here was unplayable if your not limited by playing on a console.

Perhaps some PC gamer modders will make this playable someday but it is not worth paying for as it is.

So, this game was actually so bad, and the company behind it's support so poor that it cost me a 6 year relationship with a vendor I used to like.

Sorry to digress but the outcome indicates how poor the game actually is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DS2 is RPG game but this game is not very hard.but most people say this game is very hard Rather this game is  Slag!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do not waste your money for this game.because dark souls 2 is the most bad console port game Ever.
The only good thing is playing music.In some areas it is!!!!!!!!!!
I can not stand that the game would be completely empty. Detailed level the playing Disaster All times playing video games on the shoulders of graphic art spread.People who say that this game is only for certain people are completely wrong.This game is not only a map, not a mission to be spun like crazy on the environment that you are looking for a monster first half with a shot to the back. Skyrim does not even have the game in terms of graphics is more like Dragon Age.
I'm glad we enter the next generation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Critic Reviews plz find another job ...

This game... Lets keep it short because this game is not even worthy of  huge review.
The story is bland as hell, same as the graphics and the gameplay ohhh my goood...
You have a jump key but you cant jump, is a lazy "jump the puddle " feature, the game is Awesome because is so HARDDD , of course is HARDDDD is a Broken Mess, over sensitive camera even with the lowest settings, awful controls layout and beyond stupid Mechanics, customizations... a lot when you can figure it out.
To sum up one horrid port that should stay in consoles, one of the worst Sp experience in years and the Mp ... well good luck with that. Avoid this crap 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

And once more time we have the same situacion, metascore : 10, user score: 6.9, so I asked why this and I downloaded the game... the conclusion : 2

Why? Because Dark Souls 1 were very good game, but this... what is this? Boring game, lineal gameplay, and very short... I don't know why these days the games are going worst. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Forget what others are saying about the console port re controls, that's the least of this game's issues.

What it does right: better usability in some ways, with improvements to game-play BUT:

Not only is an xbox controller mandatory and there are xbox prompts on the screen AND the graphics are way worse than in previews but the fact that this is the barest of bones port is revealed in terms of how spell durations, invulnerabilities, even some actions are timed in the game.

They do it by using counters decremented each time a frame is drawn on the screen. Not this is a dubious method of programming anyway (haven't these people heard of timer interrupts?) but at least on the consoles, which are locked to 30fps, there's not much of a problem. On the PC however, where frame rates can vary immensely and you have a massive problem. Especially in PVP. It means the way spell effects, melee moves etc work depend on how fast your PC is. Appalling.

Also: the game world is trash. Unlike the original dark souls none of it fits together, you can't see most areas from most others, even when you clearly should have. They even have the inside of a volcano you go upwards to get to from a tower above which is open sky! So many rough edges I can only think they rushed things and needed more time to finish but instead decided to release what they had.

So, it isn't just a poor port but the whole game smacks of a quick cash in too.

Also: They have now removed VAC secured multi-player support so good luck tackling cheaters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was fooled by the excellent reviews this game recieved.  It is not an excellent game, especially on PC. I am literally going to say the same thing that everyone else who gave this game a bad review said.  I only made it to the first town outside of the tutorial.

At first, you cant play the game because you will literally need to establish your own key binds for keyboard/mouse. All of the tutorial messages display the XBox controls, so you dont learn any keys from the tutorial. It took me 1 hour and some internet research to rebind the keys.  That is because you have no way of knowing that Shift+Left click is the equivilant to XBox 'A', so no matter how many times you rebind your keys the settings wont save until you look up on the internet how to hit 'A'.

There is no explanation of whats going on at all. There are creatures in the tutorial I was unable to beat, even after looking up online how to beat them.  There is no quest log or map, so you had better remember what you were supposed to be doing. If you talk to a person, they dont necessairly give you any info until you stand there and talk to them over and over and over... If they had something important to say why wouldnt they just say it?

Having the XP and money system the same is garbage, on my first, second and third attempt at a new  game I didnt even understand that I had been forfeiting all of my characters experience by dying after I had allready died.

I can see that the game has merrit, but I genuinly did not enjoy the game and I really tried to give it a chance. I am a huge RPG fan, and I dont mind being thrown directly into harms way, but you shouldnt need to research walkthroughs and wiki's just to understand whats going on.

Also, I laughed at someone elses review on here, I was still unable to light my torch even after looking up how to do it - didnt care to figure out what the PC equivilany to the XBox 'Y' was.

Try this game before you buy it, or you may be sorely disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what a rip-off. i have never felt so cheated by professional opinion. metascore of 91? close to skyrim?
next time i will check the user score before buying. the graphics are 2005, the handling via mouse and keyboard feels like solving rubik's cube on a bull ride. maybe a good buy for frenetic fans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, to get this out of the way first, the port is good. it is playable, but you need a controller. This game is hell with keyboard and mouse. But i won't focus on that, because the main game is trash anyway. Just know that i have played it properly with a gamepad, and my criticism is not about the port.

If you try to be objective for a moment, and look at this as a piece of software, comparing it with the competition, you can't help but wonder how can this compare to other AAA games of its era. Graphics are bad, animations and hitboxes are archaic, controls are literally trash. Sound is nothing special, music, what is music? Dialogs are few. The character system is bad and not explained, you can't design a good character without a guide. Enemy AI is non-existant, enemies just stand on their place and just hit you with swords/arrows/whatever. They are just hit point sponges. There are bugs. This game could have been created with 4-5 interns at best. This is no AAA.

Then we have the supposed "difficulty". Make no mistake, this game is not difficult, it is cheap. Let no blinded fanboy and "hardcore gamer" tell you otherwise. There is nothing difficult with Dark Souls. If it had a proper save system and allowed proper difficulty settings (easy/medium/hard), it would have been much, much easier than other games, because there is literally no enemy AI on this game. If you play Skyrim on the hardest setting, enemies can become HP sponges too, and hit you harder. Same thing, on a far better video game.

You don't have to be a good gamer to complete this game. I am all for a challenge, but i am 33 years old, and my time is limited. I don't have the time to die 500x times, lose all progress and have to travel all the way again, or grind endlessly in order to beat a boss. That sh1t should have died in the 80s/90s. This is not difficulty, this is tedium. Difficulty is trying to beat a hard AI in chess. Having to grind to win a boss or die repeatedly to learn its patterns, is just a way to waste hours of your life for no reason. It is just BAD DESIGN. A proper human being, that means not a basement dweller, has no time for this sh1t.

Last but not least, there is no reward for suffering to complete this game. The story is trash, the lore is trash. You have nothing to gain by completing this, other than "bragging rights". For me, if anyone, and i mean, anyone, comes to me and tells me that "he is a hardcore gamer because he wasted hours of his life dying cheap deaths in order to finish a non AAA console port", it is a litmus test for being an idiot. "sure bra, you completed this abomination, what a life accomplishment you made!" All the while normal people play real games to relax for fun. They accomplish things were it really matters, in real life, not in a trashy video game made to torment them and waste their time. Time is precious and short on this planet.

I can't explain the high scores of this game by reviewers. Typically, the metacritic scores it has achieved are reserved for classics and masterpieces, and this trash is not. Also, typically, Japanese games have become garbage in the PS3 generation and afterwards. Repetitive trash with low production values. From software was a small japanese developer never known for any good game prior to this. So how come they made it? I believe it is a combination of "marketing" (read:bribes), younger gamers' inexperience and vanity, and Stockholm syndrome. Sony and Japanese gamers/media, have every reason to attempt to push this cheap trash as a "masterpiece" in order to make a comeback in the industry. They don't have the budgets/expertise to compete with western AAA, with a few exceptions, so they get "creative" promoting obsolete design as a virtue. Professional reviewers don't want to score it lower to not be called "n00bs" and told to "git gud". They typically never finish their games, they almost always play on easy, but somehow they adore Dark Souls... Yeah right... Kids with no accomplishments in their real life, are eager to show off by finishing this turd, and then go online and tell everyone and their dog about it. And they call anyone who won't suffer this garbage "a casual". Most of those kids have completed this game by sheer repetition and grinding, or with guides and cheats. Yet they want to keep the appearence of having fun with it, because admitting this is trash, will make them having to admit they wasted their time and what they accomplished is nothing special. Or maybe they are kids, so they don't value their time. Probably the reason for the whole popularity.

I have even seen a best game ever list on us gamer, putting Dark Souls on No1 spot. That is after the release of Witcher 3... Calling it a master piece and work of genius. My God, the emperor has no clothes. Are these clowns getting paid to write this?

Waste no time with this series of games. Next time someone calls you a "casual" for it, just laugh at his face. This fad will be over soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is literally unplayable on PC. I wish I could actually review it based on I don't know, playing the game? The controls are a nightmare to figure out, and barely work once they do. I've experienced freezing and crashing beyond any other game I've ever played. How about next time a game doesn't work for PC, DON'T RELEASE IT ON PC. Serious waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me start by saying I specifically registered this Metacritic account to post this review, hence the user name, and I am a certified huge Zelda fan .

So when I say I was horrendously disappointed by this game, I feel the need to share why and think the single best word to describe it would be "uninspired". That said, maybe you need a bit more of a break down:

1) Mini-games - Hoping for shooting galleries? Bomb-chus? Deku sprout flying? Prepare to be disappointed, what is usually some of the best gameplay instead leaves the completion-ist in you almost deciding to pass on playing. Luckily, these games are beyond easy so you won't even have time to get bored.
2) The flattening gimmick - It's like combining annoying camera angles with boring controls, you can't perform any actions while flattened so essentially the game's central mechanic is walking back and forth, so much fun! (It's really not).
3) "Rental System" - Do you not completely suck at video games? Have you played 1 or more Zelda games previously? Prepare to have more money than you know what do with! Rent/Buy everything the first time you have enough money, because boy you aren't going to ever need to scrounge...
4) Difficulty of puzzles - Thinking water temple hard? Nope, not even close, in fact, if not for all those blind alleys, dead ends, and walking back and forth (see above), you could do every dungeon practically at a dead run!
5) Character Originality - Nope, no Minish Cap sassy companion, no creepy mask vendor, no ambiguous alignment shadow creature, I mean even a robot with no emotion is more interesting than the bulk of the cast.
6) Storyline - You would think with all of the content, they would of nailed the "nostalgia" factor at least, unfortunately the storyline is such a direct rip-off/merge of the single most popular Zelda title and the one it stole its title from that you can expect credits to be rolling and still not caring about anything or anyone in the universe.
7) GAMEPLAY - Gimmick aside, it plays like a Zelda for SNES. Now you may be thinking (I liked that game, it was fun to play) but really, from trains to touchscreen controls the handheld titles have been the creative platform for numerous innovations, this one adds nothing. It's crisp, but that's about the only compliment you could pay it.

In summary, uninspired. Thanks Nintendo. It's pretty bad when Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask remakes are somehow more original than your brand new titles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Removed all the fun from The Legend of Zelda series. The fact that every item is available from the start just by paying for them makes the game feel like it belongs on android, and removes all the incentives to finish any dungeon at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was marketed as a sequel to A Link to the Past. What I expected was well polished sequel to the fantastic original. Not only did they alter the story so radically that it makes no sense in context to A Link to the Past, but the gameplay was so easy and boring that it took me only 2 days to beat. I instantly felt cheated, and decided I should sell the game as soon as possible so I could go buy Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Do not buy this game. As a huge fan of the series, I have beaten 15/17 of the games in the series, not counting Hyrule Warriors, and this game was a huge letdown. Do not buy it. Borrow it from your buddy, beat it in a week, and then move on with your life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game does deserve ANYWHERE NEAR the praise that critics and users give it!

It is an uninspired platformer with nice art and mechanics, but I can have that experience with SNES games if I have a nostalgic itch to scratch. It brings nothing interesting to the table. You have a hook-shot that works, ninja stars that hit stuff, and a few ninja moves to kill and sneak. It is empty and vapid.

Unless you are a die-hard stealth fan, you will be disappointed that you actually spent money on this. I spent $6, and I regret it immensely. Have never been so disappointed by a Metacritic score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ridiculously over hyped.  Once again, I got this in a Steam sale but I was hesitant to buy because I don't have a good game pad and prefer mouse/keyboard.  I had a DEV tell me in the forums that this game is totally fine with mouse/keyboard; it's not.  Controls are crap with mouse/keyboard.  Good art style.  I guess great if you're *really* in to stealth games it might be worth it but it's just a forgettable sidescroller for me and not a particularly good one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am truly mystified by the universal acclaim this game has gotten. The first few hours of the game ARE good, very good even. However the novelty quickly fades as you progress further into the game. The game is totally linear with little to do other than the main 'quest' that furthers the storyline; all but one or two of the side quests are brief, uninteresting and completely unrewarding. Furthermore the emphasis the game places on the overarching purpose of the main character is bizarre: you are warned of a big bad archdemon and a giant army of evil darkspawn, but these are quickly forgotten as you trudge through boring, uninteresting dungeons/quests for 50 hours in order to 'get ready' to fight the darkspawn army. While playing on hard, the combat is rewarding in the sense that the game is difficult and you will be forced to tweak your tactics for each particular battle, which is a good thing. The problem is that there are really only a handful of skills that are worthwhile, I couldn't imagine playing this game without Cone of Cold. Some skills/spell trees border on unuseable, and with such a slim selection of skills this narrows down your selection quite a bit. The absence of a concrete storyline in the twilight portions of the game is particularly frustrating. While having a direct influence on the outcome on the main storyline/other characters is obviously a must for an RPG, Bioware literally leaves almost everything up to the player in the latter portions of the game. Having a choice is good: giving the player too much choice leaves the experience empty and kind of hollow as you no longer feel like you are immersed in a storyline, rather you are just finishing the ending yourself for the writers. In the end, the game is long, grindy, boring and unrewarding. The items, skills and sidequests are all incredibly bland, and the world has little charm. Some of the characters ARE interesting (Zevran, Sten) while others are cookie cutter characitures and feel completely dead and predictable (Alistair and Leliana, and Morrigan is one of the most awful annoying characters to ever grace video games). The world is filled with red tape, and 90% of the gameplay is in effect waiting as all you are doing for dozens of hours is getting ready gathering an army for one battle sequence that lasts no more than an hour or two. I really wanted to like this game but was sorely disappointed in it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The mechanics are woefully inadequate in this game. Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect 1, 2, 3, and Old Republic are all better in terms of mechanics while also maintaining the high level of storytelling and player choice that this game is known for. The thing is all of those games have been made by the same company, so I don't know why this one is so different in such a bad way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After completing Dragon Age: Origins, I was sorely disappointed. The high reviews made the game seem like it would be something innovative or new, when it was really just a cheap Neverwinter knockoff with no multiplayer or campaign editor. Below is my breakdown: Pros: Party members have diverse personalities Good voice acting Challenging Mildly interesting story Decent NPC interaction(Though way too much of it) Cons: Unoriginal concept Controls not intuitive Poor gear system(lack of decent upgrading system) Repetitive questing Inventory system makes selling a pain Very linear after the 'origin' quests Not enough options for party tactics Leveling up was unrewarding Crafting system is poor Way too much talking to NPCs Limited skills planned for Fighters/Rogues Prestige classing was pointless Shameless DLC plugs everywhere throughout the game Graphics sub-par for what was advertised Boring all the way through The cons list can go on and on, but I have to stop at some point. As hard as I've tried I really cannot come up with any more pros than are listed. The reason that I gave this game a 2 is that at the end of the 25 hours it took me to beat the game, I felt that all the time had been wasted. This is the first time I've played a fantasy RPG and not enjoyed myself in the 15+ years I've been PC gaming. My personal opinion is that DAO is a no buy/no play. If you respect what little free time you have to play games, just stay away from this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has NO HEART in it.  The world is boring.  No NPC to talk to.  Full of one liners.  All you do is stare at the mini map and follow in one direction towards the marker.  There is no exploration.  There is no good loot.  In fact they made it easy by letting you find a bunch of junk items and a "SELL ALL JUNK" when visiting a merchant.  What's the point of picking up junks simply for selling? Normally junk is considered items you end up not using but could be used if you had plans or skills for it.  They really took the "role playing" out of RPG.  All that left really is just a vanilla game.  You cannot customize your party equipment.  You are forced into using certain roles for your companion if you want to maximize their potential.  The actions of this game also go so fast that it feels like you're in a freaking shooter game with the ability to pause.  Don't get me started on the DLC money making scheme either ... ... and be careful with these reviews.  Google "dragon age Chris Hoban" and see for yourself.  This game should rank somewhere in the low 7s as average score due to the graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The AI is enough to drive you insane. The amount of times I told the dumb followers to follow me only to turn round and they were nowhere to be seen.
In combat you will spend more time telling your companions what to do then actually fighting yourself.
I bought this expecting a cross betwenn Oblivion and Mass effect, but got a 1990s through back RPG that was neither enjoyable play or particularly good to look at. Something went seriously awry in the development process. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a big fan of Dragon Age Origins and was very disappointed in Dragon Age 2. In Dragon Age 2 there is very limited ability to personalize your character. You can only play human and if you choose a warrior you do not have the option of utilizing two sword as you did in Dragon Age Origins. One of my largest concerns with this game is the lack of being able to read your complete dialog prior to choosing a path. They provide two to three words to choose from and at times your dialog does not go in the direction you would like. This alone somewhat ruins the game for me. you cannot choose armor for your companions and instead can only upgrade. Different is not always better. Bioware should have stuck with what they do well, bring a great story to life allowing the player to choose their path. Dragon Age Origins is so much better than Dragon Age 2 on so many levels. Many individuals , including me, are also having difficulty getting the game to play correctly (Check out the Dragon Age 2 forum on their home page). My set up is above and beyond the recommended yet my game will slow down and lock up, especially during dialog. Check out the forums on Dragon Age 2 before purchasing, Maybe they will have a patch out shortly. If there is a Dragon Age three, they lost me at two. I will no longer preorder Bioware games until after I read reviews. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really excited when I got this game, but it soon faded as the harsh reality of a boring combat system emerged, I tried to play on but to no avail. I really struggle to see why everyone loves this game, sure the graphics are nice, yeah it has quite rich content, but that doesn't redeem the RTS/RPG reject offspring of a combat system, I've mass effect and i thought it was brilliant, but this was a complete let down tbh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Compared to Elder Scrolls, Dragon age is very disappointing with its linear closed world. It puts up this facade that makes it seem you have some options and a non-linear game, but the game world is tiny and all paths lead to the same conclusion. The Battle system is really lacking as well, as if they could not decide if they wanted to make an RPG or an RTS/RTT. Although consequently as the critics point out you could spend more time in the pause screen than actually doing anything. Basically this game has nothing new or interesting to offer the RPG genre and that alone would be 5/10. The insanely numerous load screens that fairly often crash and the very dated design polished with fancy graphics 2/10 seems generous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This "game" has interesting mechanics, but it missing following parts:
- beginning
- ending
- story

It is a walking simulator.
Or demo version of the game, which you can complete in couple hours. I don't know why it is popular nowadays to release any incomplete product and call it a game. But when I pay money for a game, I would like to see at least some plot, especially if one was advertised. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Batman: AA represents everything that is wrong with the games industry today; sky high production values, but the games are short and so easy a caveman's child could beat them. Sure, the combat can be fun, until you realize that you just have to mash the buttons to win every contest. No skill is required. The game is very linear and short, and the game designers obviously new the when the decided to sprinkle the Riddler's trophys all over the place for you to look for, in an attempt to distract the player from the actual game, and thus avoid finishing it in one sitting. I don't know about you, but I didn't buy a Batman game so that I could go on an Easter egg hunt, I bought it in hopes of being able to kick some butt. And you do get to kick some butt, but unfortunately, the butts are too easy to kick, so much so that it's no fun. "Congrats, you have the ability to mash buttons" Not very rewarding, to say the least. I give it 2 points, one for the graphics and the other for the voice acting. The rest of the game is the stink. Would make a nice rental for the prepubescent in your life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I play virtually nothing but D&D computer games. I LERVE Baldur's Gate, and even think Icewind Dale and Pool of Rad II are okay. I've owned Neverwinter Nights for six months and spent a total of two hours playing it. My computer massively exceeds the specs but the game slows down so badly in places as to make it virtually unplayable. What's going on here? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main campaign really sucks. Each chapter, the main quests are always: find 4 items located at the four corners of the map. The quests are nonsensical. You cannot change the plot, there is no choices and consequences, you can only do what you are told to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am not a graphics whore so I gave this game a 2 based on it's multiplayer aspect. Controls are awkward and slow and as a friend of mine put it, slinging a wet noodle around would be more accurate than trying to kill someone with one of the KZ2 weapons. Movement basically feels as if you are wading through molasses. Thick molasses. With quicksand in it... The guns are useless and the cover system WISHES it were as intuitive and responsive as in Gears. If you are a fan of Halo 1-3, any of the COD games, Gears of War or Resistance don't bother buying this game: it will just frustrate you for it's lack of precision and speed. I want to love this game (the graphics and menu art are second to none) but gameplay is what it's all about in the end and this game just doesn't deliver. I highly recommend you try the demo before buying (I didn't and basically tossed $60 in the toilet.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Killzone 2 was one of the most hyped and anticipated games for PS3 when it was being developed, and in many ways it lived up to that hype. The graphics are the highlight here; the story, characters and game play are not the best I've ever seen, nor are they the worst, but they're not great. I didn't play the first game, so perhaps I was at a disadvantage with the story but I struggled to keep interest in it almost from the start. Bad guys come, you kill them, you move on. It's been done many times before and this game does it uninspired from start to finish. The characters are hard to like, one of them including profanities a couple of times in each sentence, although the main antagonist is easy to dislike he is not a memorable one. The control system is something I had trouble getting to grips with, and I felt there was a delay between my button press and the gun on-screen shooting. I changed the controls and it became easier, so if you're struggling try this too. Killzone 2 is a hard game to like, but I did complete it in 10-11 hours. 1/5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so eager to play this game that I put down my deposit in angst a month ago. This was by far the worse game I played this year. Terrible plot line and even worse chatter from the in-game characters. Save your money, I do not not know why websites rate this game above 90%. Save your money and do not repeat my mistake. I'm going to try to get at least half my money back in an exchange. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first one was very good, recommend it to everyone. The second was cool can say i recommend it too, but the third... IT SUCKED! Was playing it with my brother and could only sustain to play the first act. it was very boring. DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! if you want to know the rest of the story, go ahead and watch a video or read it. the two points go to graphics and story. Gameplay is the same, nothing new really, some new weapons though. It's the same AGAIN. enough for two games but it doesn't last forever. I didn't try the multiplayer and will probably not do that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously, this sucks. The graphics stink, the gameplay is old and the story seems like it was written by a person who has seriously no imagination. I can't express how much this game sucks. The only thing good about it (why I gave it a 2/10) is that the multiplayer is quirky, but decent enough. If you get this game give it to the person you hate the most in this world. This is the worst TPS I have ever seen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game. The story is obvious and already seen so many times, this game just try to be original in all the way that he can, but always fails.

Seriously, this whole thing about mixing 3D and 2D is too overused. And the gameplay sistem is all messed up, seems like it want the player to go mad. Is impossible to play.

I give it credits, the intro was very nice, probably the only part of the game that wasn't frustrating, and the ambience and animations are really well made. They should have spend all this time thinking about the story and not those little things.

A game that I don't suggest to play. Never-ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OVER-HYPED FODDER.

This game... wow. The art style is pretty boring. The game play is somewhat unique however it fails on nearly every level of being exciting or challenging. You have gameplay like this and the entire game is still a walk in the park? Who MADE these levels? A second grader?

The main character is completely bland and uninteresting. I could care less about his hat (a fez, which the game was named after. Yes. The game was named after the worst hat type in human existence).

In the end, pass completely on this. I can't believe ANYONE would give this a 10. Seriously? FODDER 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay is tolerable enough, and the gimmick is a decent idea. unfortunately the graphics and background noise make the gimmick more annoying than anything- if the graphics meshed perfectly with the gimmick this game would easily be a 5. And I should note the low score isn't that the graphics look bad- for a 2D platformer in a retro style it's colourful and has a nice style. It's just that there's a lot of clutter that interferes with the gameplay.

Of course, it'd still only be a 5, so where else does it lose out? It's dull.

The game itself isn't interesting, and that's problematic. The best feature of platformers is they get you into the game right away, you don't waste a lot of time and they don't have parts that drag on. Or if there were, there would at least be something filling it up like an interesting story. This does the opposite of all of that.

Backtracking, large lulls where nothing happens, constant stretches of just walking- I could go on, but ultimately it comes down to this.

Fez is not an entertaining game. I play games to be entertained, unfortunately for this one, the only entertaining thing that happened was the creator having a public meltdown, but I'm not going to give the game extra points for that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game runs and the visuals are not bad(+2).

The game is basically paper-mario but with no production value or story. Game Features: Wander around aimlessly for 30 mins, Look at decent visuals, Remember paper-mario.

Most people will buy the game on sale for their dusty indie collection and never play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was one of my last games to get sucked in by the hype train. Everyone called it ground breaking, and once I started playing realized my mistake. I hope you like not knowing what the  you are doing. BUT LOOK THE WALLS TURN 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible field of view which has not been upgraded from the console made it unplayable for me. I game on a PC because I cannot stand to play any game with a perspective that feels like I am trying to watch the action through a slot designed to post mail through.

Clearly a lot of effort went into this but they failed to deal with the most important issue rendering all the effort ultimately pointless.  I don't buy games on a PC to be experience games with limitations imposed by console hardware.

Apart from that I found the combat very dull indeed.  I know these games are all very much reskins of the same thing when it comes to combat but this compares very badly even with similar games such as Shadows of Mordor which has far more immersive combat despite essentially being a similar console trype RPG lite formula.

Extremely poor and a good example of why PCs are currently coming back into vogue.  Got this for 5 Euros in a Steam sale or I wouldn't have bothered and it wasn't even worth that.

Very cinematic and probably more aimed at real batman fans. Some good voice over work, character development and the usual upgrades on console graphics but still a poor port as it was ultimately unplayable for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible console port. The game looks OK in DX9. DX11 doesn't work  at all. The controls are terrible - its impossible to get past the guys with shields  playing with the keyboard . I wasted 30 minutes activating it and then it was crashing every 15 minutes. My drivers were from July 2011. Then I installed the latest Nvidia drivers, those with the Batman: Akrham city ad on them and the game got more stable, but still has crashes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fallout 3 is bland, lengthy, tedious, and repetitive. I often hear people say they like it because the world is so big. Honestly though, who cares if the world is "big"? It really is all just the same burning rubble copy-pasted all over a big map, so there isn't really a whole lot to explore because very little of it is new and you also can't interact with much of it anyway. The only things that break the repetition and boredom are the cities, but there aren't that many, and they are very few and far between in a HUGE wasteland. The world is definitely "big," but there also isn't much to do in it or interact with.The developer didn't provide any vehicles, so while "exploring," you get to have fun walking...everywhere... at a painfully slow pace. Imagine GTA, but without cars, with a lot of burning buildings that you can't really interact with the vast majority of the time, very few people, and it's populated by the same 5 kinds of bad guys all across 90% of the map. Despite the terrific art-style and interesting setting, the game does a terrible job of storytelling, and what little story-content there is is spread out throughout approximately 60 hours of mind-numbingly repetitive combat and "exploration." Soon, you realize that you are fighting the same bad-guys over and over, that the houses and assorted bits of rubble and trash you see lying all over the world all look more or less the same, and the whole experience is downhill from there.Repetitive combat + copy-pasted rubble + no significant story = boring waste of time.Don't buy into the hype about the game being "open-world." Open world games aren't that great when everything you come across in the game looks bland, lifeless, and identical to 80% or more of everything else you've already come across in the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know this is an old game but boy was it terrible. Go here do this... go here get that... I hate fetch quests and this game seems like one big fetch quest... I bet the story is horrible... I gave up... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I've had Vista on my computer, I played this game, but it was so boring I wasn't able to finish it. It's some sort of pseudo-open world, it's repetitive, every location looks the same. Now I decided to play it again, but NOW I have Windows 7 on my computer and guess what? This piece of flip is crashing because of 2 two things - Windows 7 and Windows live. Windows live is lame as flip and not workin', and Windows 7? This game has compatibility of hamster. 10 year old games are perfectly playable even now on modern systems, but game made in times of Windows Vista has issues on Windows 7! So, basically, this (s)flip is crashing, playing it is a pure deprival. I destroyed my DVD and buried that crap in a sewer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was a huge fan of Oblivion so I was pretty sure I was going to love Fallout 3. How wrong I was. The horribly clunky VATS combat system, uniformly boring landscapes, and a dull central plotline all conspired to make this game unrelentingly mudane. I plodded through the central quest and was glad when it was all over. Weirdly Fallout 3 takes some of the best things about Oblivion - the ability to roam almost anywhere without obstacles getting in your way, side quests that were still accessible even after the central plot was done and dusted, and rich rewards for scavenging - and it dumped them all. I'll be selling my version on ebay shortly. Whatever you do, don't buy it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another example of a fanboy infested, overated game. I had high hopes for this game as its predecessors were so outstanding. I was extremely dissapointed. I was expecting a engaging and interactive atmosphere in a post apocolyptic setting but I was given instead an empty map with nothing going on in it. It was a chore for me to walk from point a to point b as I was expecting a STALKER like system in which there is constant fighting between different groups in the environment where I would be caught up in the crossfire and be able to take a side or take cover and wait out the battle or navigate around it, except I was greeted by a empty environment where the only fight you will get are single robots and mutants placed randomely throughtout the map and a small group of pathetic bandits which are easy to dispense of. I don't see why they made such a big map if there is no point of bothering to travel anywhere, it was a serious bore for me to travel anywhere because the map was empty. Then theres the guns. Oh dear. The guns all feel unfinished and poorly designed and there is a pathetic aresenal of weapons that you can obtain. The player crafted weapons I have all seen before, (a gun that shoots anything you put in it, yeh that hasn't been done before) and they didn't really make me want to seek out the blueprints for them as they were simply terrible weapons. The guns are all extremely underpowered and they all have terrible recoil and animations that had no real appeal. One quest near the start of them game has you gooing to a mutant infested city with only a hunting rifle (which is a total peice of shit) and a crrappy little pistol to fight mutants with miniguns and rocket launchers. But mind you, the AI is so dead beat retarded that you are able to walk up to them and melee them to death. Then theres VATs. This was were I lost a huge amount of interest in the game. All you do is select VATs, target their head and they're dead. If I were a retard or a mindless console fanboy drop kick I would be drooling at the prospect of having my aiming done for me, but thankfully I wasn't born with a brain the size or a pea and I can aim perfectly on my own. I dislike the fact that Bethesda regards it's buyers as idiots who can't do anything for themselves, mind you it is true though, as this game was swamped by mindless fanatical fanboys. Then there is the storyline and the quests... This is where the game is at its worst. The main quest would take you 3-4 hours to complete uninterupted by side quests or item hunting. It has you following your dad... Yes that's right, your dad, on a fairy tale quest to purify the water for all the people in the wastelands, who also happen to be trying to kill you, so I wasn't really that keen. Almost every single side quest was a go there get that then come back quest or go there kill that come back quest. Then there is the AI. I was so bored with dad's stupid mindless speech and boring responses that I blew off his head and proceeded to dismember his body parts, at the dismay to the characters involved in the quest regarding the dad and the water whom I also proceeded to dismember. I then happened to stumble across a fallen space ship with a alien ray gun that disintergrates anyone in one shot, so the difficulty level fell to about the same difficulty as breathing. I then ventured out into the wasteland hoping that I could get a battle that required more than selecting Vat's, going for a piss then coming back to every enemy dead, but once again, the only enemy I encountered was a single mutant or robot which proved highly boring. I was also told that there was endless customization. WRONG. The only customization there is are 2 different pairs of glasses, a hat and 3 different types of armour. Then I was also again told that there is great character interaction and hard choices to make and well written responses and speech. Once again, WRONG. It's jsut a typical, good response, neutral response, random question, witty response, the witty responses would only make a 12 year old kid laugh, then again that is most of the buying audience for this game. This game is is non deserving of it's score and is only so highly rated because of payed reviewers and hyped fanboys that know no better. Overall a medicore game that brings nothing new to the table. Just another post nuclear apocolypse RPG that is going to be gathering dust on the shelf. I will never play it again. I gave it 2 because the graphics where somewhat pleasing, other than that, a simply put, shit game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll never understand the hype that's been brought upon this game. The dialogue of the characters seem very cheesy and simple. Also, I've played this game on three different powerful PC's, and the controls are horrid and delayed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't usually review/rate games but the incongruity between the rave reviews and what I experienced with this game compel me to do so. Lame story, writing, and voice-acting. Simple, repetitive gameplay that requires no skill development (unless you count patience while enduring extreme boredom as a skill); laughable NPC AI. The only redeeming aspect of this game is the interesting scenery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totally. Worst. Sequel. Ever. This game began to annoy me from the very beggining, and it's ending still annoying me: This damn green color everywhere, dolls - characters, stupid Washington city, which doesn't make any sence, because it have unbroken houses, no nobody lives there, copy-paste with G.E.C.K., Enclave, Supermutants, which not supposed to be here. And the most important thing - it's stupid, uniformly and boring to play.  This game totally dissapointed me, and i don't trust Bethesda anymore.

I purchased fallout 3 GOTY edition last summer (2011).  After my initial (partial) playthru, i confess to being astounded that this particular game could b awarded GOTY for the yr it was issued, or, 4 any yr.  Virtually everything about the game is steeped n mediocrity, including (but not limited to) graphics, plot, storyline, audio, continuity & interface.  It's not that it's a bad game, but there's nothing i could find that's outstanding n any way.  But thats not the reason i gave it a 2.It gets a 2 b/c this is simply the buggiest game i hv ever purchased.  U will probably find the remainder of this paragraph difficult 2 believe, but i hv no hidden agenda n writing this.  There r sections of the game where i had to restart the game every 10 seconds or so for over 10 times n a row to continue playing it.  There were instances when i've attempted to start playing the game & it took between 5 & 10 attempts just to get it to load, so i could start playing it.  Ultimately, of course, u should check w a variety of sources of input b4 making a final decision on whether to purchase this, or any, pc game, but 4 me, i've promised myself to NEVER pruchae any product from bethesda again, since i believe there's no way they weren't aware of the bugs, but decided to release the game that way anyway.  Thats a str8 punch n the face of the consumer & i feel they shld b punished.  U've been warned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't get it. What's all the hype about this game? Same thing over and over and over- just in different parts of the map/world.

Seriously overhyped. This is boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks ass. If it weren't for the awesome user made mods I never would have bought the game. In no way is it anywhere near as great as the originals. **** writing, **** storytelling, **** graphics, **** fps integration. Just a horrible, horrible game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst fallout ever. It's not a fallout, this **** is in the beautiful wrapping - bad and illogical storyline. Why? Throughout the game you will find only four homeless people suffering without clean water. 200 years after war but the feeling that it has been a couple of years. Stupid locations as DUNGEON  of kids or town with ****ty superheroes of a new time. **** endless subway, dungeons and vaults.
-Hello, i need your help - kill all vampires - u must go to the **** metro
-Hello, help us to destroy their base - u must go  to the **** metro
-Hello, help me to find my inventory - u must go to the **** dungeon.
-Hello, we fightig against mutants, help us - u must go to the **** metro.
-Hello, go the vault and find "this" item - 1 more hour for this quest.
Monotonous location. Big useless boring Washington.
Sniper rifle is not able to kill a supermutant from 5 shots, but gun that 1000 years make it easy for 2-shot.

Play fallout 1-2, new vegas and 4 (shooter with rpg elements (NOT RPG with shooter elements), simulator of sims, homeless, magpie and blacksmith), but never play to this ****.
1 point  for music
1 point  for 2 interesting dlc

So, I just tried this game on the 360(too bad i couldn't get to try the pc version.) and at first, I was interested in the story, gameplay, graphics ect. but I must say, pretty much everything people say that is flawed about this game is true sadly. It would seem that Bestheda Studios really doesn't A) Care all that much about the franchise, or B) They can't make games worth shit. I did play Oblivion(on the 360) and noticed that all this game really is, is a poorly made mod of the oblivion engine. Characters, boring and forgettable. Movements and animations, total shit. All around, this game resembles nothing of the Fallout franchise. And if the pc version is the same as the 360, i would never even pay $20 for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you advertise a game for sale on the PC platform, you should assume that most people will be playing it with the peripherals generally associated with a PC and program your game accordingly. A game that is all but unplayable without an additional, expensive peripheral is, in my view, fatally flawed. The game gets a score of 2 because at least it looks pretty while failing rather spectacularly to properly respond to your inputs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unless you are a hardcore gamer, able to spend countless hours on this game and money for an excellent controller/PC, do not waste your money on this game. First the decors and characters: lifeless, you need a top end computer with an excellent graphic card to be able to play at the recommended 60 fps. If you are unable to hit the 60fps, you are heading for the gameplay troubled island. Gameplay: the difficulty is extremely poorly managed. Basically: unless you are able to pull the combos as the hardcore gamers, you wonâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this game is terrible!! Fair enough i've only played it for about an hour, but that hour was enough to make the judgement. It's the same boring, jumping-about rubbish that put me off Street Fighter all those years ago. The only skill involved is in learning the ridiculously hard special moves, there's no fighting strategy that a game like, say, Tekken will give you. It's just jumping about and fireballs and occasionally trying to pull off some move that you've blistered your thumb trying to nail. I only bought this game to fill the fighting game shaped hole in my games collection ( i don't own a console by the way - if i did this probably wouldn't have got a second glance), sadly that hole is still there. If you like the shallow, fireball-fest that has always been Street Fighter then you'll probably like this as it has a lot of characters to play and looks pretty nice, but i need some depth to my combat and this is just too shallow. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is as slow as thick poo through a funnel. I bet the 90+ ratings come from mag-reviewers with monster PC's at their office. I had too turn off almost all of the graphics on my brand new dual-core AMD with 2GB of memory and a 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Get this - the game is not on XBOX, yet the button prompts are xbox and the only controllers apart from Steam's that are supported are Xbox sticks. What the f....
You also can't rebind keys.
There is also maybe 30 minutes worth of singleplayer, which will not save stats because it requires always online, and to top it all off the servers are constantly down.
GJ Capcom!

The actual game play in this is quite bad. Dont expect to run the ball at all--ever. Ive also noticed that it doesnt seem to matter how skilled your players are (unless your simulating everything). your 97 overall runningback will be brought down by a 69 ranked lb every time. Your 99 WR will still be covered like glue by the 77 CB. Kind of makes the whole "getting better players" part really pointless. The AI is also a little skitso. . . if you mix up plays as a real football coach should, you'll get nothing. but if you find one play that the ai cant adjust to, you can run it all game long--very boring. So its the actual finding a good play rather than finding good players that gets to the winning. As far as the franchise mode is concerned its excellent. you can draft, sign, trade much better than before. I especially like how you have to do research and your not sure what youre drafting, just like in real life. you can relocate your team which is very cool. the owner portion is also very cool but that was put in place in madden 2004. If you havent tried it, borrow it or rent it first--change the game dificulty above pro (to all pro or all madden) and see if you like the game play, because without it, its just a glorified football sim. (or you could do this, buy espn 2k5 and rent madden 2005--25 bucks-- and then see for your self which has the better gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is extremely boring, in terms of gameplay. As someone else said, don't bother trying to rush the ball against the CPU- you'll get nailed to the ground. I'm a casual player (I prefer FIFA 2005), and am put off by the difficulty of the running plays. If I play at the 'Rookie' level- I win every game easily; but at 'Pro'- I get stuffed on almost every rush. I have to passs most of the time (If I can evade being sacked in 0.5 seconds)! What a joke of a game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is just bloody awful. All the team and player names are wrong - how can this be a simulation of football?? The game is constantly stopping for fouls. If you get the ball and run anywhere near a computer player in their half they foul you. It is difficult to control your players who seem hell bent on completing worthless animation sequences instead of what you ask them to do. But the worse thing is that even with a game pad you only get 8 directions on the pc and passes just never seem to go where they were intended. In fact holding the pass button down longer (suposedly for a long pass) makes no difference. The computer controlled players on your team constantly run offside or don't make any decent runs whereas the computer team can split your defense in half with one long ball. The league system is crap and you can't simulate a real league with cup competitions etc. The menu system is poor. This is real tosh. I honestly can't understand what all the fuss is about. This is a very bad game.

Hello PES Freaks!!, I'am very very dissapointed about this part.. part 5! I have all parts of PES and now i bought part 5 and i returned it to the store!!, WHERE IS THE FAMOUS GAMEPLAY????!!!, they copied the gameplay of Fifa2004, that i know because i had Fifa2004 just to try and after that try i trew it away, garbage!! And now, My favorite soccer game ever have betrayed me!! and i will never buy PES parts anymore because they failed.. That was my comment about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't get me wrong or think i'm a hater/troll.  I love the AC games and their unique story in fact this game will deliver you some story that'll help you understand the 3rd one more.

Its just that this game is basically an overpriced DLC for AC2.  It played exactly the same way except this time Ezio can be a big whig Assassin CEO that makes all of his grunt workers do everything being killed in the process while he ponders where he'll take his next vacation and decide if he wants the prime rib or lobster.....  HELL GET BOTH!!!

I love ubisoft and they are one of the good guys in developers who listen to their community but I think this time they were needing some money at the end of the year to fund new games so they released this knowing that people like myself would buy it.

The only thing this game gets a 10 at is multiplayer.  If you're sick of playing shooters and want something more innovative in a MP then you should give this one a try and just wiki the story to save ya some time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely boring. Besides the somewhat nice graphics, the environment is dull, the story is boring, at no point did I feel engaged, the animations are horrendous when in a cut scene, voice acting is okay, game play is repetitive, and had tacked on sci-fi. All three of these games are boring and represent the lifelessness of current gaming. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it feels like oblivion, but without the different character types like mages, warriors etc. it lacks the re-playability, even if you want to replay this game....lifeless, boring dialogs, npcs make the player not give a damn about the situation. main story lacks the twists and turns to keep the players attention. the oblivion also had these problems...lacks depth like different bullet types, modification of weapons, armors, different damage types etc. it feels childish to represent in points since there is only one type of category beside the conditions of items like the damage points, instead of comparable barlike properties in these categories..wasteland feels too empty to really excite the curiosity of the player. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have the second highest rated video card in my computer and every time I turn around in this game, it crashes. That is ridiculous.  I wish I had never bought this game.  Granted, the scenery is beautiful and the plot is fantastic. But, I can't continue the game if I'm not allowed to go where the quest leads me.  Fix this.

Reason for 2 stars?  It's the Best $50 guitar lesson to be found.  Why not more?  Read on.

Length of Ownership:  6 weeks.

I purchased this game/learning tool (G/LT) to spice up my practice and (hopefully) learn something new.  Having played guitar for over 40 years and possessing more than 20 years online gaming experience, I felt confident that I could find a way to make this software work on PC with reasonable results despite its game console (PS, X-Box, etc.) heritage.  Boy was I Wrong.

Platform:  Win 7 Pro, intel Core i7, dedicated Radeon Graphics, 6GB RAM.

Guitar:  1977 Les Paul Custom

Cans:  Shure SRH-440

Installation:  Ordinarily installation of any complex and interactive software requires more than a single attempt.  I have installed and re-installed the software At Least FOUR times.  The requirements to install the software, create an account with UbiSoft and register the software are cumbersome at best.  Moreover, despite its relatively recent release date, registering unique user account names is equally unwieldy.

Logging In:  Once the G/LT is started and the PK confirmed, a second login is required by UbiSoft for the Profile Created and the ability to utilize web-based content and tools.  Having written SAS code for over 20 years, SQL code for more than 10 and possessing over 20 years writing macros for every kind of software imaginable, this is overkill.  Given the sophistication of the software, RS2014's programmers should be able to make this game start with a simple double-click by merely linking the software and PK to the MAC address on the host PC.  This is but one of the tell-tale signs of this G/LT as gaming-platform software.

Game Play:  RS 2014 purports itself to be both a game and a learning tool, but fills neither role particularly well.  As a game, it awards points and level advancement based on (seemingly) arbitrary ability to hit particular notes as they approach on the interface.  In order to advance in the game and begin learning more complex pieces, the player must successfully pass through a series of "lessons" the software deems appropriate given performance on particular tracks the user has accessed.

Learning Tool:  I have been playing Iron Maiden's "The Trooper" for over 25 years (note for note on all rhythm parts confirmed by multiple tabs I have read) but have never had a tremendous amount of success with the solo phrasing.  After going through the track in game about 4 times, I was assigned a lesson regarding "position changes."  Similarly, I have played Rush's "The Spirit of Radio" since 1982 but have always felt my execution of the signature riff needed polish.  After half a dozen runs playing every note (again confirmed by multiple tabs acquired over the years), I was assigned a lesson for "bends."  (The only bends in the track are in the solo, many of which require a trem which I don't have on my LPC).

Downloadable Play Content (DPC):  Being a Huge Rush fan, I wanted to make use of the 5-song expansion pack.  While I know the overwhelming majority of the tracks note-for-note, but in need of polish, I purchased it online as at Least One of the THREE websites regarding the pack stated that it was compatible with RS2014.  Having non-backwardly compatible expansion packs is yet another of the tell-tale signs this is gaming platform software.  This is something one would expect from Microsoft after 4 new iterations of MS Office, not something one would expect from a second-generation G/LT.

The Bottom Line:  While RS 2014 is the Best $50 guitar lesson one would ever hope to buy, it is neither a jack of all trades nor a master of one.  The installation and login procedures are more cumbersome than logging into a Swiss bank's accounts database and the AI intended to assist guitar players in improving knowledge, technique and skills is lack luster at best.

Not ready for prime time
Mouse doesn't work always or we'll
Extremely long download time
Not enough user control
When one's mouse doesn't work keyboard nav is bear.
No simple login one has to copy and paste or memorize the code
Like most software it really is not for beginners.
There are lessons for beginners BUT when one tells the program one is a beginner it does not take one to the true beginners lessons.
If my son didn't have this on his ps3 I would want my money back but then he would get the guitar.

Very boring, short, and shallow. Interactions with npcs and choices are very terrible. You interact with people by farting at them which sounds funny but when thats the only upside to the game its garbage. Magic has no balance because there is one spell that does more damage than all the others at the same cost as the others. The plot could be interesting if it had actual depth and took more than a few hours to complete. The game has no challenge unless your goal is to kill yourself which is impossible. Shooting mechanics are atrocious. The multilayer isn't even worth being called a multilayer its more of a tug of war between people for screen control. I gave this game a two because overextending the fart expression and messing it up causes you to crap your pants. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed with this game again lionhead studios have lied about just what features this game has pick up fallout or farcry2 before you bother with this title will only leave you with buyers regret raced out to pick this up at midnight launch here in Australia wish id stayed in bed AVOID.

Poor gameplay! to much like the first one with restrictive paths and no challenging enemies. enemies are so easy to dismiss i get excited to see something to kill because i know the fight will be short and unfulfilling. also very disappointed with the lack of content. The money every 5 mins also ruins the game almost immediately "woo hoo i own everything" but theres nothing fun to kill, dont waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is rubbish i wanted to go to a building and it didnt let me in but it is where i needed to go to get misson 2 i am so disappointed about the makers i think it the intro is rubbish there is one good thing about it its name and graphics !!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Give me Gears 2, dross like this is getting more wide spread on the 360! Its becoming a 2nd rate system thats selling well due to its low price, but its a budget machine, closed off system. Only one game worth playing on it and thats Gears. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ok so i am going to start with listing the positives: the artstyle is the good (just google why. my opinion on the artstyle basically belongs to the entire human race as well) ok now for the **** parts: the combat is awfull with you having to move for diferent attacks and therefore mising all the time and even with the always use best attack on you miss anyway becuse unless you are level 10000000000 in the weapon you are using then you will miss a lot no matter if you are a mele guy. traveling is complete torture becuse even if you are sprinting then you still walk in a decently brisk pace and becuse stamina drains so fast then you will have to rest every milimeter (by the way no fast travelling). and the interference is so unintuntutive that a nuclear reactor would burst into laughter. i could go on and on about why this game i so bad but have **** to do like say deleting this **** tragedy of a game from my steam library. (sorry if  there are typo's im terrible at spelling). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am giving this a score of 2 as it does have technical merit.  The designers put a HUGE amount of work into this game and as all the other reviews state this is a massive and very intricately designed world.  However, with the risk of being controversial it is an outdated game and I found it overall a very bleak and depressing experience.  The world feels soulless and like some fantasy world post nuclear apocalypse.  There is so much reading to do that after a while you feel you should be curled up on the sofa with a Tolkien trilogy and a good glass of wine instead of trying to play a game.  As a result tedium sets in very quickly and with the by today's standards rather ugly and disjointed graphics it just becomes too much of slog to get to the end.  I think you either love or hate this game.  The haters are obviously the minority but we do exist - sorry! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not sure if anyone that has reviewed here actually played Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, Icewind Dale and the other CRPGs...

At best this game is lackluster, sure it has good graphics, and the dialog between the companions is great but IMHO as an old time P&P D&D player, Obsidian has failed by not using any recognizable CRPG game mechanics, and instead dumbing the game down for the LCD's... Using endurance and heal mechanics, but failing to include a way to actually heal... The lack of really interesting armor stats or gear stats (all armor is pretty much the same. dr and recovery). The abilities and talents choices are horrid, basicly just forcing you to chose the ones that suck the least... They know the genre, yet they decided to make the game player feel as though they have been given a blue ribbon for participation. I'm just glad that a friend loaned me his copy so I didn't have to pay for the game to find out that Obsidian, a company I trusted, would vomit this perversion of a crpg out...

I say this after re-playing Baldur's Gate 2 last month, this game is a mere shadow of what they did with the D&D mechanics, Obsidian can do better, they have done better, and anyone who gave this game a better score than 5 should feel ashamed that they went fanboi instead of actually telling the truth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My experience of the game is so at odds with popular opinion that I am writing a review on this site for the first time ever.

Somewhere out there on the internet are a set of composite images featuring the blended, averaged faces of thousands of different humans, male and female.  Unsurprisingly, the composite faces are extremely plain and forgettable - placid eyes, neutral semi-smile, medium-brown unblemished skin.

The writers appropriated and reused many stock fantasy tropes in creating the world for this game, but they didn't do it in piecemeal fashion - a daub of Tolkien here, a splash of Forgotten Realms there.  Instead, it feels like they grabbed every fantasy setting they could get their mitts on, crammed them into a Blendomatic, and hit Frappe.  The result is sort of like those composite photos.  Everything's been so averaged and smoothed over that you can't even recognize the specific source material any more.  All you can tell is that you're in a fantasy setting.  That's it.  You can tell because there are tall people and short people, and a lot of them have names you've never heard before, and some of the people have swords and shields and others of them cast sparks out of their fingers sometimes.

There are a lot of words in this game.  A lot of lore, a lot of history, a lot of dialogue.  Reading is great!  I love reading, generally.  But reading in this game is like reading the ingredients list on a packet of saltines, or like reading a patent for a new kind of chewing gum wrapper, because the source material is just as bland.  I've played for over 20 hours (trying to squeeze my money's worth of fun out of this particular stone) and not once did an element of the world strike me as interesting; not once did I want to explore any more of the dialogue or of the in-game texts than I had to.  Compare this to a game like PS:T where I was hooked from the moment I woke up on a cold slab in a transdimensional mortuary and a floating, foulmouthed skull started gabbing at me and I stayed hooked until the credits rolled (and I've played that game again, quite recently, and it's still as compelling as the first time I played it).

It was said in another review that the game feels like it was made by people who hate the genre and hate its fans.  I have to concur.  They say never to attribute to malice what can be explained by incompetence, but I feel the blandness of this game goes far beyond anything anybody could come up with on accident - it genuinely feels orchestrated, premeditated.  A bunch of **** in a board room somewhere drummed their fingers together like Mr. Burns, cackled a dry, rasping, collective cackle and set themselves to the business of creating the biggest **** you" of a fantasy setting that the genre has ever seen.

There are negative things to be said about the combat, the music, some other miscellaneous gameplay and HUD elements... but why bother?  The soul of the game is missing: who cares if the body is flawed as well?

The only positive thing to say about it is that the prerendered backgrounds are very pretty.  I think that's about it, and it's actually amusing that most of the positive reviews start out by warning people who want sexy graphics to seek out a different game.  In reality, the graphics are the only thing PoE has going for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game itself was fine, and is the second best of it's ilk to come along since all those old Infinity Engine games.  Visually I liked it, sound was fine and the party system was fine.  Quests and story?  Fine.  What's wrong with it?

Minus a few points for very poor encounter design & planning in certain locations.
Minus a few points for overdoing it with the backer placement stuff.
Minus a zillion points for there *still* being serious bugs (e.g. entire character inventory disappears). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are nice, just as expected.
Music is dull and unmemorable.
Writing is average, quests are nothing special, few characters with any depth to them. Decent amount of different diolog checks is nice, though they mostly just a flavour and don't effect anything.
Combat is fun but seriously lacks polish and balance.
Stronghold is useless and boring, as is crafting.

Overall an ok IWD-style dungeon crawler, but not quite on the BG level.

p.s. too sjw. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is frustrating on purpose. I love a good challenge and I will sit and play something over and over for hours just to beat it,  but Demon's Souls is a whole other matter. I tried it for several hours, playing through section after section of the first level only to die multiple times because I love to explore. I read notes left by players, avoided sections meant for higher ups, and killed enemy after enemy on my journey to the boss. It never got fun. I waited and tried really hard to like this games as it was recommended to me by multiple friends, but its appeal just never shone through. I don't understand how this game got such a good review. Many elements of the game feel broken (targeting system is crap, difficulty increases with death, etc) and it tries to be difficult just to be difficult. How is that supposed to be fun? I don't play games to sit through such frustration, I want to have an enjoyable experience. I'm just so disappointed with this game overall, it had incredible potential, and I don't understand how so many others thought it was nearly flawless(10/10) . It's acceptable at best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was pretty shocked when I looked at the reviews for this game, so many of them so high. First and foremost this game is utter garbage. The controls are terrible, the graphics for a 2009 PS3 game look horrendous, there are many PS2 games that look stunning in comparison, even attempting to compare it visually to any modern game and you will find yourself looking like a fool. I was fortunate enough to get this game for free from PS+ membership, if i had actually spent money on this I would be nearly as pissed as I was when I purchased BRINK, which is hands down the worst video game ever created. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awsome graphics, ok controls, and a story you probably won't see because you broke your controller from the frustration this game causes. The difficulty level is that of playing D&D with a Dm whose dog you'v run over, spilt drink onto his pristine D&D books, and generally have pissed off, before a session. You will die alot, you will restart from the beginning of the level, alot. You will tire of it very quickly. you also restart the levels with half health when you die and don't get it back till AFTER the boss fight., unless you have somewhat hard to find item. which you'll worry about wasting cause you know that next death is right around the corner. Rent this first, you'll be happy you did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Demons's Souls is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played.  The mythos is kinda fascinating, the visuals are solid and some of the online community features are interesting but otherwise It's a piss poor execution of even worse gameplay Ideas that should have died back in the nineties.  I don't want to ramble on about the awkward and unnatural control setup or the boring NPC's or the punishing initial difficulty and skip to the main thing that ruins the whole game.  Every time time you die not only do you loose all you demon souls (effectively currency) which is pretty sadistic as it is, you go all the way back to the beginning of the stage and all enemies re-spawn.  You can try to fight your way through to the end of the stage or at least until you unlock a shortcut to the warp point at the start or fight through some then run back to the warp point and upgrade your character, but this almost doesn't matter since will be playing the same stage fighting through the same waves of enemies over and over again.  It's not exactly helped by the fact that there are pitfalls and sudden difficulty spikes all over the place.  I toiled for hour's to find something plausible about this game with is unforgiving gameplay, lack of music, atmosphere, decent character creator or even a pause feature make this and incredibly frustrating experience for all but the extremely patient and tolerant.  My final score is a 2 out of ten.

Firstyl i would like to say good things about this game.

1 Really challenging it makes you stay attention all the time and gives you a intention.

2 People around the world leaves you a messages as advice during your adventure or you can leave to them.

That's it, these are above only good things about this game and rest of it really really awful.

This is the worst RPG game i have ever played.

Can you believe you can not pause this game until end of it?.
Can you believe there is no map in this game?
Very bad inventory and status screen interface.
Very limited equipment chooses.
Do not crash the corpses that you killed they will be  stucked to your feet.

This is the first time i am saying this: '' This game is overoveroverrated''

Play Dragon's Dogma instead. It is probably closer game of soul series and have open world that you can inspect and much more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is bad, that all I have to say. It has one of the worst level design I have ever seen, the first area is fun, the combat is fun, the game is awesome, and that's why I am more upset about this game, when you kill the first boss  you feel like a badass you feel like you did something important, and then the fun ends with the bad level design, you reach a long bridge thats a dragon protects and insta-kills you, if you even succeed to cross the bridge you are greeted by 10 **** archers, and they kill you, and that means you have to respawn at the beginning of the bridge. but if you (somehow) killed the archers you enter a boss fight which is a **** giant and has **** of archers, and if you die guess where you are going to respawn? this game is bad, play dark souls or bloodborne 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played plenty of Dark Souls games. Best of those seemed to be Dark Souls 1 because level design and lack of stupid punishment  system that was implemented in DS2. Luckily DS3 seems to be lot like DS1 in game design. Now after getting my testing DS3 i am happy to go back playing DS1.
I would buy this game at discount. Game has terrible framerate issues game is mostly of the time unplayable because of this. Safest choice is to wait about 6 months and perhaps it gets better optimized due patching or you get game at decent price.
At this moment game is not worth any hard earned money that you have earned. Seems to be just another example of rushed poorly optimized beta stage game that seems to common practice in gaming industry these days.
Asking you t buy this game and giving 10/10 is just way of saying "Go full retard" and  you all know best advice is "Never,go full retard" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a real time-waster. Even the daily quests in WoW are more fun than this! Running from the checkpoint to your dying place over and over again is what you will do mostly here. Checkpoints are usually far from one another and if you are cautious and prefer to take the shortest way, you can miss a lot of content. A lot of the fights in the game, including boss fights do not offer anything different and there is very little room for tactics - mostly always it's "hit first and roll out, or take a hit and you won't make it to the next checkpoint". One of my worst spent money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well i buy the game because all the Critic reviews says its a must have game and i was looking for a beautiful RPG game ... 2 hours later i ask and have STEAM refund ...
Game is not adapted to PC (keybord and mouse) so all the commands are A RL ... -> game is in beta mode
UI is ugly, create and custom a character is painful
I dont fit any story in solo mode ... just get kill buy badass boss

Refund Refund Refund 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was made out of Bloodborn , so they didn't have to spend much resources on a new game, you can see how stats/combat work similar to Bloodborn and not Dark Souls. This is just a cash grab and nothing else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a horrid console port.  Game doesn't support 21:9 out of the box.  The combat is clunky and it feels like you are fighting the animations and the time of them more than you are the enemy.  Couple this with the clunky movement and that's the reason for most of the games perceived difficulty.  It felt more like I had to fire off an animation in the general direction and hope it completed and I could move before the enemy did.  The combat is more of a whack a mole than anything.  Graphics are a huge mixed bag, you can obviously tell it was a console port.   The skybox is laughably bad.  The stand around monsters made me think I was playing everquest again with all the static camps.

I wanted to like this game as most modern games are far too easy, but the clunky combat, ridiculous story, and static game just made me uninstall and refund after about 2 hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Guitar Hero. not a real RPG. everything is just awful. story, control, fun. one of the worst games I've played so far. and no - it's not hard. it's just dumb. no fun at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst incarnation of a Souls game imaginable. It borrows bosses, and mechanics, from Demon Souls/Dark Souls 1. It doesn't improve on them, in fact it is just the opposite. A great example is the "poise" system from DS1. Poise is in this game, but only in name. It appears on armor, and even in item abilities, however it has no effect on the game. This means that any fast attacking enemy can stun lock the player to death, completely negating your armor.

The poise issue only further shows another fault in the game. Enemies have been changed from previous games. Fast attacking enemies no longer have stamina, instead they have an infinite amount of stamina and their attacks are based on a roughly static "attack per second". While this means that one versus one you can easily beat them, it also means that if there are more than one the player has a  much higher chance of getting killed. This isn't a case of "getting better", because there is no poise the player will now get stunned as soon as they are hit the first time/or their stamina is drained if they block. If all things were equal it would still be annoying, however enemies in the game do have poise. It is removed from the player, while enemies get full "hyper armor". This means that the player may try to swing that big axe like the npc, but if they get hit they get stunned out of their attack unless it happens in a few frames of hyper armor. Big weapons with wide swing arcs are generally used to kill lots of weak things fast, but that won't work anymore.

That is just two of the problems with the basic attacks. IF you look at magic you will see other problems. For example scaling in the game is broken. Not in a positive way, but in a completely nonexistent way. Further if you do reach the 50+ area where magic actually starts to deal damage, you will have the exact same outfit as everyone else who is magic.  You might ask, why? Fashion souls is the real end game, right? Not when it comes to magic, because in order to be viable you need a specific setup. You need a certain head piece, a certain dagger, your rings etc are all set. There is no variety because of how the system is designed.

Instead of just making enemies hard, they have coded in artificial forms of increasing the difficulty. FOr example some enemies are coded to have a shield and face you all of the time.  If you try to kick the shield then the game lowers the shield and counter attacks. However unlike DS/DS1 in this game you become animation locked far more frequently. An easily observed example is to start running, and then try to turn another direction. In DS your character would simply move, but in DS3 you get locked into a pivot animation. There are no iframes for this, and it counts as a counter hit giving the enemy bonus damage. So if you try to kick the shield the enemy is programmed to drop their shield and counter attack while you are unable to do anything. That isn't about skill, that is the complete opposite of what DS stands for. That is taking the ability to make the play from the player, and instead asking them if they can cheese the system like a speed runner. This can be observed when fighting knights past the dragon barracks also. They have a lock on feature that will lock on and hit you through walls, or invisibility. Despite having never actually observed the player they are capable of buffing then executing an attack on an invisible silenced enemy.

I could go on, but this game isn't that worth it. It gets good ratings from people that never played the first ones.  This is just a pale, pathetic, imitation of far better games. The only reason it's getting 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the clothing options available. They did a better, if still racist, job. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bugs, cut content - horrible community and the PC version suffers from a MAJOR hacker problem.  Exactly, I could write a huge review here and mirror what all the other people have said - its not going to matter much because there are far too many fanboi posts or employee posts boosting positives.

My personal problem with the DS series as a whole,  is the game isn't difficult - its cheap, there is a difference.   If your going to make a game thats brutally unfair, then the physics and execution of the game needs to be perfect and none of the DS series has managed that so far.

If you want a perfectly structured review, then read Dhelio's review since that more or less is spot on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, to get this out of the way first, the port is good. it is playable, but you need a controller. This game is hell with keyboard and mouse. But i won't focus on that, because the main game is trash anyway. Just know that i have played it properly with a gamepad, and my criticism is not about the port.

If you try to be objective for a moment, and look at this as a piece of software, comparing it with the competition, you can't help but wonder how can this compare to other AAA games of its era. Graphics are bad, animations and hitboxes are archaic, controls are literally trash. Sound is nothing special, music, what is music? Dialogs are few. The character system is bad and not explained, you can't design a good character without a guide. Enemy AI is non-existant, enemies just stand on their place and just hit you with swords/arrows/whatever. They are just hit point sponges. There are bugs. This game could have been created with 4-5 interns at best. This is no AAA.

Then we have the supposed "difficulty". Make no mistake, this game is not difficult, it is cheap. Let no blinded fanboy and "hardcore gamer" tell you otherwise. There is nothing difficult with Dark Souls. If it had a proper save system and allowed proper difficulty settings (easy/medium/hard), it would have been much, much easier than other games, because there is literally no enemy AI on this game. If you play Skyrim on the hardest setting, enemies can become HP sponges too, and hit you harder. Same thing, on a far better video game.

You don't have to be a good gamer to complete this game. I am all for a challenge, but i am 33 years old, and my time is limited. I don't have the time to die 500x times, lose all progress and have to travel all the way again, or grind endlessly in order to beat a boss. That sh1t should have died in the 80s/90s. This is not difficulty, this is tedium. Difficulty is trying to beat a hard AI in chess. Having to grind to win a boss or die repeatedly to learn its patterns, is just a way to waste hours of your life for no reason. It is just BAD DESIGN. A proper human being, that means not a basement dweller, has no time for this sh1t.

Last but not least, there is no reward for suffering to complete this game. The story is trash, the lore is trash. You have nothing to gain by completing this, other than "bragging rights". For me, if anyone, and i mean, anyone, comes to me and tells me that "he is a hardcore gamer because he wasted hours of his life dying cheap deaths in order to finish a non AAA console port", it is a litmus test for being an idiot. "sure bra, you completed this abomination, what a life accomplishment you made!" All the while normal people play real games to relax for fun. They accomplish things were it really matters, in real life, not in a trashy video game made to torment them and waste their time. Time is precious and short on this planet.

I can't explain the high scores of this game by reviewers. Typically, the metacritic scores it has achieved are reserved for classics and masterpieces, and this trash is not. Also, typically, Japanese games have become garbage in the PS3 generation and afterwards. Repetitive trash with low production values. From software was a small japanese developer never known for any good game prior to this. So how come they made it? I believe it is a combination of "marketing" (read:bribes), younger gamers' inexperience and vanity, and Stockholm syndrome. Sony and Japanese gamers/media, have every reason to attempt to push this cheap trash as a "masterpiece" in order to make a comeback in the industry. They don't have the budgets/expertise to compete with western AAA, with a few exceptions, so they get "creative" promoting obsolete design as a virtue. Professional reviewers don't want to score it lower to not be called "n00bs" and told to "git gud". They typically never finish their games, they almost always play on easy, but somehow they adore Dark Souls... Yeah right... Kids with no accomplishments in their real life, are eager to show off by finishing this turd, and then go online and tell everyone and their dog about it. And they call anyone who won't suffer this garbage "a casual". Most of those kids have completed this game by sheer repetition and grinding, or with guides and cheats. Yet they want to keep the appearence of having fun with it, because admitting this is trash, will make them having to admit they wasted their time and what they accomplished is nothing special. Or maybe they are kids, so they don't value their time. Probably the reason for the whole popularity.

I have even seen a best game ever list on us gamer, putting Dark Souls on No1 spot. That is after the release of Witcher 3... Calling it a master piece and work of genius. My God, the emperor has no clothes. Are these clowns getting paid to write this?

Waste no time with this series of games. Next time someone calls you a "casual" for it, just laugh at his face. This fad will be over soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A broken piece of crap. The gameplay is as basic as it gets, it's unnecessarily hard, the game as is has no plot or characters and it's generally unpleasant. Visuals are nice... when the game doesn't crash or frame rate suddenly doesn't drop for no particular reason. Don't waste your time and money on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the worst part of souls franchise. lots of bugs like the murders through the walls, the inability estus replenish, and much more. In general, this is not  "souls" game but bloodborne without all its fatures. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too hard and save points are made to frustrate. Have to redo to much. Not optimized for PC. The controls are awe-full. The devs have obviously never tested on mouse and keyboard. Movement just doesn't feel smooth. Feels janky.  Bugs galore. On the other hand the atmosphere and sound is well done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found this was a disapointing game. Microsoft should have done better. It was toooo much like Age Of Empires. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game graphics are good, but the game is just WAY TOO EASY. There is absolutly no challenge playing the PGA-Tour part or the WorldTour part of the game. And you can forget playing with your friends in tournaments that part i removed. I am very disappointed in this game and cannot recommend anyone to buy it!. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So Walking Dead isn't a game as such, it's more like an interactive movie. There's no gameplay.. it's a matter of choosing dialogue and clicking on objects to interact with them. Need to open a door? Click the door. That's as complex as it gets. My problem with the game isn't that it's light on gameplay, because that's intended and has been executed fairly well. My problem is that it's a story and dialogue-driven experience, and the story is boring. If you've ever read a half decent book, you'll be bored to tears with this material. For the hell of it, imagine you aren't playing a game and instead you're watching an animated movie; you'll soon realise it would be the blandest, most predictable, cliched piece of crap ever created. So if it's light on gameplay, and the story is terrible, what's the point? What's the point indeed. Anyway, you may as well get it since it's $5 on humble bundle and decide for yourself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Broken & horribly optimized, the game screwed my saved file 3 times in a row and I literally had to edit the games programming just to make the damn game functional.
While the story was good, story alone is not worth the massive acclaim this game is getting, if anybody thinks this broken game is worth a 10/10 then you have the worst possible taste in gaming ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

See I love the show so I figured, "Hey the game must be awesome! Can't wait to shoot zombies!" Well don't waste your money. The controls are ridiculously idiotic and it should not be in the third person. There's no character development (none of them are likeable, just annoying) and you hardly do anything in the game anyways! There's no shooting, only derpty doo going to put my little floating d-pad on the zombie and let the game do everything for me! Lee moves as fast as a snail and the areas are always too limited and hard to navigate. I'm glad i got it half off or i would've been really mad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a seriously waste of time, money, great potential and from the developers standpoint talent. This is not even a proper game you click one button watch some boring cut scene wait for some drawn out and pointless quick time event and then maybe if you're lucky you get to walk around a bit in a boring and uninspired travesty of a zombie overrun world, rinse and repeat. The only reason this game has gotten any positive attention is obviously because of the excellent TV series and the only reason this game has won any awards apart from the bad ones (Which is the ones that it deserves) is because its different NOT good but different. Hopefully someone will pull themselves together and produce a game worthy of The Walking Dead name. I'm hoping that this was just some sort of speed bump in the progression of gaming cause if what we see is the future then we might as well pack up now and be gone cause no good can come of this. I'm being exceedingly generous by giving this so called "Game" a score of 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hated it played the first episode it was awful. Way worst then the show most overrated game ever    . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is probably so popular out of nostalgia. I'm a long time Zelda fan, have played a majority of the series ever since childhood, starting with the original, love this series more than any other video game series (along with Final Fantasy), but as I played Majora's Mask, I just kept waiting for it to get good, and it didn't.

I think this game relied too heavily on regurgitating content from Ocarina of Time. Character models, weapons and items, soundtrack, sound effects, so many things were exactly the same. It seems like they lazily slopped together something new from old content. Where the hell is Zelda? Isn't this the Legend of Zelda? She was shown in a flashback and I kept waiting to see her actually have a part in this plot, but she didn't. No explanation for why childhood link has ended up in "Termina", no longer in Hyrule, but all the same people he knew in Hyrule were there, some of them mortal enemies in Ocarina of Time, now just chums.

The time mechanic was the most terrible annoyance and seemed pointless. Most of the "scheduled" events were sidequests that you had a one in a million-chance of being at the right place at the right time to encounter without using a walkthrough. I'm shocked to know that the Song of Double Time wasn't in the original because if I had had to wait for time to pass over and over I'd have wasted such a huge chunk of my life playing this game I'd have probably given up after the first temple (oh wait, that is exactly what happened when I played it on N64 long ago). Though my biggest annoyance was that even after slowing the flow of time there were times I ran out of time JUST as I was nearing the end of a dungeon. It's bad enough you have to be timed trying to solve the dungeons, but it's a slap in the face that there's a freaking collect quest in each one for great fairies, some of which are practically impossible to find without a walkthrough. Some dungeons I had to make a choice whether to finish it and fight the boss or take the fairies to the fountain b/c I wouldn't have time to do both before the world ends. So I had to do one and then start the days over and go through the temple from scratch. Who the hell thought that would be fun? It's not fun. It's a waste of time and utterly annoying.

I think this game insults its players by making them repeat many tasks via the time mechanic, not just if you run out of time, but if you want to get alternate options on a quest, or if you have to go "correct" one of the four regions again by fighting its boss to start another quest in that area that is dependent on it being in its proper state.

Honestly, the countdown timer in the game didn't make me feel a sense of impending doom since there is no real end to it and you can just start over. All it did was make me aware that hours of my life were trickling away as I played this. I am all for the designers of Zelda taking liberty with a game that strays from the traditions, but I just didn't like this game, and I played it all the way to the pointless, lackluster finale where nothing made sense and it got surprisingly even more gaudy than it already was. I feel like this game is a window into someone's acid trip... Rather than it having the poignant dream-like feel of Link's Awakening or the dark delusion and gloom of Twilight Princess, it all just seemed so tacky and unguided, so random. Links screams and animation every time he put on a mask were gag-inducing.

There really wasn't much of a plot or any friends or emotional attachments for Link either, so storywise this game was really shallow. The only time I got a remotely emotional reaction was during an optional side quest about Anju and Kafei... and maybe for a split second over that Zora who dies on the beach, whose friends and girlfriend never find out he's dead... unsettlingly.

I didn't actually enjoy playing as the various species except maybe the Goron. The various controls and attacks seemed to make Link's set of equipment fairly useless and it didn't feel like a Zelda game much. Imagine playing Twilight Princess as a wolf for 3/4 of the game and how awful that would have made it. That's how I felt here. There were also many, many times where this game just had awful controls and physics, especially when controlling the alternate forms, and it would punish you with constantly having to redo or retry something to get it right when the problem isn't that the player isn't skilled. It's that the controls are clumsy and unresponsive and often do the opposite of what you tell them to.

The music in this game was mostly not memorable, and the new ocarina and instrument "songs" were terrible. Most sounded like random notes and not songs, unlike the very memorable tunes in Ocarina of Time.

I feel really disappointed and surprised at how bad this game is, so much that I'm struggling to feel this was a Zelda game and wondering how it earns its praises. It's gotta be nostalgia or people who love side-quest games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I couldn't even get past a couple of hours playing this game. Yes, it's difficult; but more importantly, it's tedious. Right off the bat the game seems to demand a huge amount of fight, heal, save grinding. The healing and saving part means you have to head back to town, go to the inn, sit through the dialogue and animation, head to the church, sit through the dialogue, wait for it to save etc. Where's the fun in that? On the plus side, the graphics and music are excellent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Does anyone else notice the horrible English in the brief about this game (under the picture and score)? It doesn't even make sense. A lot of Japanese games are like this now. Whatever happened to real translators instead of people using  google language tools to translate everything. Also, this game is no different than any other japanese RPG, long, boring and the story is retarded (See Star Ocean, FFX, etc.). Want to play a good game? Check out Shadow of the Colossus, Star Wars: KOTOR, Neverwinter Nights, Morrowind, or Fable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

NO Replays !!! I'm not kidding, NO replays in crash mode. I don't know how much $ EA paid these reviewers to give it such high scores it doesn't deserve. No menu options for screen or controls. No wheel support. If Burnout 3 was a bit to confusing and difficult for you and you just want to push X and hit cars then buy it, otherwise, you'll be VERY disappointed. Burnout 3 = 9/10 Revenge = 4/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

over priced for whats on offer, if your lucky to have a good pc then save your self $30 and get the pc version because its better in graphics sound and playability. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off, this is really not an X-Com game and if you go in looking at it as a new IP then you will be a lot better off. The game is heavily streamlined/dumbed-down from its origins and rather than a turn-based strategy game like the original X-Com games, you are buying a turn-based ACTION game, like a turn-based Gears of War. You are limited to 4 squad members to start, you cannot build or manage new bases, the maps are pre-done rather than random (and can repeat through a game), and virtually all of the strategic portions of the original X-Com have been deleted. I suspect this was done to "attract the CoD/GeoW audience" but it just makes the unsuitable for any true strategy gamer and its slow pace will certainly keep away the FPS fans. Now this is not specifically a "bad" game, and if you are the type of gamer who thought "wouldn't it be cool to command a Gears of War squadron (dressed in Mass Effect armor) in a turn-based game but without all those unnecessary strategic elements, new base building, and micro-managing" then this is the game for you. X-Com EU has loses the overall strategic gameplay, and is all turn-based action with Mass Effect armor and guns. Not for me, but who knows, there might be an big undiscovered market for this game type. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know how this game got so popular i just started and i keep dieing nonstop to level 3 enemy's.
So far it is very frustrating. no way to change difficulty in game probably have to start a new one or hack the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was highly over rated compared to Borderlands.  The leveling does not map to solo player game play and neither do the weapons.  The side quests are the same way especially if you do the ones in  "The Fridge".

Animation was poor at best as were what little interaction you had with Roland, Lilith or Modecai.

The fast travel network was terrible especially if you were in the middle of a specific area and had to make your way back.  You could only quit the game and save it in hopes you would get back to the start.  Enemies re-spawned over and over and way to quickly.  As a solo player reached a level of 38 and the weapons were terrible.  Almost impossible to reach Level 50 to battle Thresher and skill trees were cumbersome and not leveled correctly to achieve needed attributes for fighting.

Played Vault Leve difficultyl after first playthrough as a Solo player and it was almost impossible because of leveling and poor weapons.  Did all side quests and explored all areas in detail.  Chests were very mediocre at best for what you had to do to get to them.

Scenery was a makeover especially going back to Fyrestone for those who played Borderlands.  It was like playing in a poorly illustrated comic book.

Will not purchase the DLC's when it comes out.  Was not worth the money.

Again, feel as it is another game in the marketplace where cost cutting was the norm to maximize profits.

Feel the consumer looses again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This multi-map pack has lead to a tremendous amount of cheating. downloadable content is susceptible to modding by xbox hackers and make the game totally not fun to play online. XBOX and Bungie have done a horrible job to protect online players from unfair play, and most of this is due to the greed of having this additional game pack. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Witcher 3 is a fantastic game - in my eyes, the best RPG published until 2015.
Hearts of Stone is a mildly interesting interactive movie.
During many of the movie sequences, where you move ten steps to get to the next movie, you cannot even save. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. No, this is not trolling-this game REALLY sucks. The combat system is annoying and unnecessary complex and the story is full, i really mean it, full of plot holes. Basically, and dont worry you are not losing anything learning it now, its the tipical evil dude which, for no reason but being evil (truly-no motivation) want to fuck up everything. The heroes final plan? Let her do it and destroy everything. Oh, man.... Bu, the most valuable part of this game (beside the graphics-top notch for a ps1) is being the inspiration for the spoony' reviews of it. Go watch a couple of it-1000x times better than this crappy game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

From reading my reviews, I am a huge Final Fantasy Fanboy in general. FYI my least favorite final fantasies are 2, 8, and 13.  This game is a little hard to review because I could imagine this game would've been ground breaking for its time.  But looking at it objectively, I have to believe that it gets mixed in with the greatness which is 6,7,9, 10, that it fools people into thinking it is good.  First, what does this game have going for it??  Well not much...  it has an iconic hero in Squall and it had great graphics and presentation for a PS title.  That's about it.  In this title, Combat is repetitive and to maximize its capability you literally have to spend hours on nearly every random encounter due to the redundant "draw" system.  Besides this, its the classical final fantasy gameplay for all its good and bad.  The story, starts off pretty strong, but once you get past the first disc, the game appears to have a fetish for plot holes and plot progression that is just down right silly and dumb even for a JRPG title.  Like I said, Squall is a very iconic character.. but besides him, not only are the other characters bland, with the exception of Seifer, they are all annoying and despicable.  The style in which you equip weapons is no where to be found and the way you "junction," almost eliminates all desire to even use magic.  Side content outside of synthesizing for better weapons is useless and doesn't even reward you for doing them.  For one, there is no armor in the game and all the weapon upgrades are down by monsters dropping rare items, so the best you can hope for is a magazine which most likely doesn't even do anything.  In the End:  This game is a downright mess, some of the gameplay makes you want to like it for the nostalgia, but the plot makes no sense, all the characters are forgettable and unlikable (outside of Squall and Seifer), adventuring is pointless, and equipment is either no where to be found or is counter intuitive.  Horrible game, but despite this, if you are a hardcore final fantasy fan, it is worth a quick play through, others might want to stay away completely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game for PC and have played the Xbox360 version, both platforms played pretty much the same, HORRIBLE. To state that NBA 2k11 was a little better is an understatement.  This game has so many flaws compared to their '11 predecessor I don't know where to begin.  I mainly play My Player, beginning with that I'll say that stats mean absolutely nothing, Speed, Shooting stats, feels like my guy is running on ice on the court.  And shot selection? I've taken wide open mid-range and 3pt shots with A to A+ and have consistently missed, throughout an entire game, for multiple games, and I have 99 consistency!!!  I'll just wrap this up by stating that I bought this on Steam for $14.99US, and I think I paid too much, get NBA 2k11 if you are on the fence on this one.  Most of the reviews online, with the exception of Youtube, seem extremely contrived or made up.  Blaming the lockout for poor sales due to improper roster build or lack of rookies doesn't make up for extremely poor execution of gameplay and piss poor mechanics.  You've been warned... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to this game. Just recieved it delivered to find i have to load STEAM in order to play it. I hate Steam, I hate it with a passion. And for it to be added into a single player game is pathetic. Poor show for the Total War team 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have not even been able to play the game yet. Steam is such a pile and keeps giving messages like, "game is not available at this time, please try again in a few minutes". I don't even want to use steam. I just want to play this game on my computer by myself. I'm sure the game is pretty awesome, but steam is just ruining it. Shame on total war for attaching this game to steam 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Install instructions are non-existant. Steam is absolutely ********* Had to discover for myself that I needed to be connected to he nent just to install the game and that I had to create a steam account before the game would install. Once that had been done had to search the net to discover game could not be run offline until it had first been run once online which it would not do untill it had been updated. So far I have been unable to update and run the game because the steam servers are too busy. Need I say more ? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

thr game might be good... i dont know cos i cant play it, cos this f...ing steam doesnt update. I´ve got two dvd´s in my box, but they are not needed. I have to instal over steam... what the... steam sucks, it is slow and not worth the price, the game has cost. 
Maybe it is a good game but how knows without the ability to play it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game could have been one of the greatest, but for some reason it was botched. The AI is useless, and there is absolutely no diplomacy in the game. Both ingredients that are vital to a strategy game. The following questions sum up my experience: Why release an unfinished game in the first place? Why after 6 patches is it still unfinished? Why after 6 patches do CA decide not to support their unfinihes game anymore? Why after the unfinished game being out for 6 months do CA decide to announce the next game in their franchise? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been a big fan of the Total War Series but this game is a disappointment. Do not waste your money until they fix the bugs. As soon as you build up a large empire and decide to take over the world, the game keeps crashing. It's frustrating as you invested so much time. Also Steam sucks. Why do I have to pay $50.00 and cant own the game! I will never buy a game that is Steam only again. Doubt I will ever buy a total war game again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game SUKS because of the stupid Steam program slowing it down all the time and the stupid patches. I am having so many errors trying to log on because I don't have the best internet connection where I live and if I lost my connection then the game craps out. I WILL NOT BUY any more total war games with STEAM, I F'N bought the game and when I have work that takes me out of town I can't play without internet...I think I have it bad but I could only imagine how pissed it would make me if I were in the military and had to put up with this BS in a war zone, I am a VET, and had to put up with this crap. I F'N paid money for this crap and now I have to log in to play, through a STY service "STEAM" which SUKS and if I loose connection the game stops working...its just reminds me of asking my mother if I could play a vidio game. DROP the steam login because I know I will not play/buy any more games that require a third party to play. AND I would never recomend this game to anyone that has to travel and likes to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This Game is not an improvement of the old game. Do not buy it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a great concept...but is also a downgrade from previous titles. for example, the assassination and spying vids were removed. performance is horrid even on a GTX295 and an INTEL i7 920. They should be fixing game play problems and the crashes instead of releasing expansion. I do not know what kind of PC it needs to run decently. Do not Buy it, my pc is high end and still lags. Interface is very hard to grasp and there are so many things to do, the simplicity of previous titles was lost too. keep your money or just play medieval 2, its a lot better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I actually kind of liked the game at first but I just decided after not playing for a few months to start a new game and I keep getting a message that the servers are busy!?!?  I HAVE the DVDs - I PAID for the DVDs!  This company owes money back to customers if this is not resolved! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well it seems the customers and the 'game' reviewers have a big difference of opinion about this game. As a customer from day 1 that is still unable to play this game without CTD or white screen crash I can honestly say that this game is nothing more than a Beta.  Dont beleive me? On C.A's official forum http://shoguntotalwar.yuku.com/topic/52508 they are asking the customers if they want to become part of a Beta Group to help get their game properly tested. Never thought I would see the mighty C.A fall from grace like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel as if I am being nice to give this game a 2. The installation alone took WAY longer than it should have, and I wasn't even able to play the game. The fact that I payed $20 for a game that wouldn't work on my computer, take up memory space, add stress to my already horrible day, and waste hours trying to find an answer. Anyone looking into this game is much better off taking the simpler installation that comes with Medieval 2: Total War. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you liked M2TW you will like this.. on paper at least. The use of rifles cause the player to use amazing diffrenct tactics, the addition of a large number of very small countries and the increase in trade abilities make this a welcome addition to the series. However was clearly rushed out, the game crashes repeatedly in various parts of the game for many of the users, the campain AI is laughable, even when at war nations (or shall i say EMPIRES) will rarely attack in land battles, only attacking fleets causing very dull gameplay. Couped with the extreme lag faced during unit selection and turns and the all over feel of unreadiness makes this game nearly unplayable. If you are new to total war get any of the previous ones, if you aren't then go play M2TW. Clearly the 'professional' reviewers once again haven't actually played the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buggy, Buggy, Buggy, has crashed 20-30 times in my first 8 hours of playing. Now stuck at one point in the game, crashing after each battle before I can save. Game should never have been released with such stability issues. When it was working it seemed like a great game. Don't waste your time starting it until the patches have been rolled out 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Waited a few months to buy the game as suggested by other users, but its been a huge dissapointment, I installed the game and tried to load it but the annoyin windows messag came up saying that the game had stopped working. Ive been a huge fan since shogun came out and i feel let down so far by empire. im gonna write another review when the game decides it wants to work and then ill see if it lives up to game spys reivew 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am truly sorry I have to rate the game so low; I wore out my Rome-TW and Medieval-TW CD 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been a fan of the series since Shogun. So far the each new release was a triumph. While being rather sceptic towards changes introduced in "Rome", I had finally started liking the new campaign map. Unfortunatelly the newest game is not what I expected to get for my 30 quid. AI sucks big time. I have single handedly kicked around all the countries in Europe on the highest level without even ONE putting up a decent fight. Campaign map is very difficult to read. And the "steam"... well I was not impressed by the instalation process. I am depressed now. I was SO looking forward to this game... Luckily I still have MTW2 installed. Back to the real game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well 3 months down the line and despite never having a crash since day one the fact remains this game is just a totally broken mess.. CA must be the first company to issue patches that actually cause more problems than they fix so well done.. The patronising updates are now also getting beyond a joke.. I cant see CA ever releasing another TW PC game after this sham. Those who are giving it a 10 really must have there heads in cloud cuckoo land along with the critics or like a game with zero challenge, broken AI and pretty graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The AI is about the worst in any game I've ever played. The AI can't invade by sea, thus leaving England impotent as an AI nation and invincible as a Player nation. It removes the point of having different continents and the whole point of the naval battles dissapear. The AI is not aggressive, does not use armies on the field properly (it can't figure out how to use artillery, cavalry and infantry TOGETHER) and after about 10 hours I realized the AI NEVER attacked my cities. This was a disgraceful release. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To much crash downs. It's a problem of the game. My PC is high performed - no problems with the requirements. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really really like this game. The total war series has always been one of my faves, and empire has been the best so far. It, for me, has the perfect balance of all the elements needed in a good stratagy game, and the introduction of navel combat was awsome. It lets me down on one cruical issue tho, bugs. I have not yet been able to complete a proper long campaign due to the fact that each time i get so far throught the game for various reasons i encounter a fatal error. like taking a city causes a crash each time i try, or ending a turn causes a crash and wont work even after a re-load, due to corrupted save files, i have had the same problem on multiple computers. Without being able to play a campaign through it makes it infuriating and pointless to start a new one. This would be a 10/10 rating, if not for that factor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like the campaign and the sea battles, but the ground battles(which i prefere more not good enough) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very buggy, spotty customer support. I cant play some of my saves because it crashes every time. I emailed customer support,and they close my tickets after 48 hrs. The first ticket I opened got closed even after I provided the info they requested. I opened another ticket asking why that ticket was closed, and that ticket got closed too. My life is too important to waste on buggy software, and jerky CS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game simply does not work. I am a QA analyst for a graphics production firm. I have a PC that is so far and above the industry standard that it isn't funny. It's very well optimized...but the code in E:TW is completely flawed. This game is unplayable. I rated it a 2 because the intro movie looks nice. The game, can't play it...even with a quad core, 4 video GPUs and 12 GB of DDR3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let's get things straight; this has the potential to be a brilliant game. Pity it doesn't work and here's why: - 1) steam - an unnecessary complication that is just unnecessary. Why should I have steam running if I bought the dvd? 2) in game crashes - after about 20 turns of my campaign I got to a point where the game crashes at the end of the current turn and nothing for me to do except restart campaign. 3) battle AI - the much heralded in game AI is not half as good as it's made out to be. The game is full of quirks which are both annoying and ridiculous. 4) load times - load times are plain ridiculous. I find my self planning what to do after the end of the current turn...make tea, get crisps, phone mates etc. 5) NPC turns - in agame of this scale there are loads of NPCs. In this my first campaign there are over 20 factions. End of turn is PAINFUL because even though I've disabled the display of NPC moves, it still takes ages to go through all of them. This game is in dire need of patching and should have never been released in its current state but unfortunately that is the trend these days. Release over hyped rubbish and make people buy it and then patch it later. I was a pc gamers for over 10 years before I switched over to the 360 and this has been my return to PC gaming. Not a good comeback to say the least. My advice is wait till the 2nd or 3rd patch and buy it then...probably at half the price!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with the above post. Plus you obviously need a int connection. I know this may seem like a strange complaint, but a developer shouldn't be forcing things on you. To be honest its not really a total war game anyway. The map is far too big(this would not be bad if it was done well) but it isnt. France is one region, and Britain is two, its seems to me like they've just taken some provinces out of Europe and labelled them America @ India. Half of it isn't even provinces just "wilderness". It goes on . . .The game certainly does not deserve the credit its getting. Its still solid but i expected more from CA, thus the 2 stars. (Oh, and they've reverted back to clone armies). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could live with the bugs--knowing that someday they'll probably get fixed--but the bottom line is that the AI sucks badly--especially the campaign AI. Why can't CA just take some hints from Civilization or Europa Universalis? Even the battle AI still pales when compared to Sid Meier's Gettysburg--and that was over 10 years ago. Not to mention the sheer idiocy of seeing troops attack massive forts with grappling hooks without any casulties!! ---just a huge step backwards from the enjoyable castle battles in MTW. Rakes, gentlemen, and clergy are unbelievably boring and a pain to deal with--nowhere near the fun of spys and assasins. The graphics are better and naval battles are fun but predictable, but basically this is the proverbial lipstick on the pig. Unless the AI is fixed this series is doomed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think it is funny because every where else people only complain how bad this game is The magazines are just promotional tools those reveiws are a little more than just biased. This is a sorry incomplete product and has no right to be out on the market yet, it's hardly playable. Steam could not even provide a manual when I bought the game through them. Shame on all the gaming magazine shills, I knew there was a good reason I don't read that garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bugs, bugs, bugs; bugs everywhere.  How sad is it that you actually hope that the game will just crash quickly, instead of hanging your system, before you can try again.  
Please give me a copy of the game the official reviewers had, so I can also wax lyrical about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so buggy. Even after the 3/10/09 fixes mine still crashed in later years on the grand board. The in battle graphics works (on high) pretty well but has some minor quirks Command not graphics). The (what I call ) the play board or grand board is where the big bugs sit. Not only crashing (a lot in out years) but, withdrawing soldiers to places where I can move them to other land space or move them onto ships. This was a good one. I had a fleet which left off on army and then 2 turns later I tried to move the fleet and it would not let me. It claims that the water I am trying send them to is land. I don't think the Atlantic Ocean is land. I pray evertime after 30+ years in that it does not crash when I make moves on the grand board. I am running Phenom AM3 with 4 meg DDR2 (2 megs a chip) and a 6800 GeForce Video card. I have played and liked the previous Total War but this was a major disapointment. You needed more beta testing. As shown by how soon you had to put a patch out. Maybe you are working off the Microsoft mentality. It doesn't have to work out of the box, we can patch it. The people who wrote the articles didn't play this game for 20hrs through a campain or they would have seen the issues. Send it back. They can do better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

wouldnt of minded if i had a poor computer but its 2 grands worth so for the first and hopefully last time im saying this game is so very poo,r at the moment i would even consider it to be some sort of breach of ethics or if it was a bank then conduct or something like that. putting out a product that could of been brilliant and will be but there are loads of brits on the team for christ sake. we are awesome at this stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To many crashes when playing long campaign games,especially if you're will far along in developing technology. Also a downer is if steam decides to update you while playing your game will crash. Way to many crash bugs for the money they're asking. Compare to other Total War games this is a joke cause of the crashes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is cool, i think, as i have not been able to play for more than 1 min before crash,crash,crash..... never buy a game requiring a steam account, it's brutal. will they ever release a version that does not require it? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Steam slows installation. Support for installation is patchy, but the game wouldn't install without it. This is not a game you can just go , out buy and play. Nine hour install on a quad-core. I missed the steam sticker on the back. Never again. The last SEGA game I'll buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here comes a low vote from me, because i think this is a scam! Paying about 50$ for a game, that i cant play b/c of all the bugs. Some proper patches, that makes the game DON'T crash when i try to start it, and so on.. It worked for a few hours and now i cant even start it.. I´ve read a lot on the web about this, and it aint just me who´s having these issues. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A real step backwards in gameplay compared to Medieval II. The new features do not compensate for what was lost from the old game. However, most annoying is that you have to play from Internet/Steam especially when messages appear when you want to play "our servers are too busy". Bought the disk and still have to be connected and play (if their servers are not too busy) via Steam. I will never buy again a game from Sega if it only can be played via a server. Probably the sad end of the Total War series which used to be a delight. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If it is not broke, then don't fix it. I have been a fan of Total War since the Shogun days. I eagerly awaited the arrival of each new series, with great anticipation and for the most part receiving great satisfaction with each game. Now the arrival of Empire Total War. My anticipation has been satisfied but I am not satisfied with this game at all. 1. I do not expect to have to purchase an entirely new computer to run a new game 2. I do not expect to have to deal with some on line server to make the game I purchased with two discs in my possession each time I want to play. 3. I do not want a server automatically updating my machine with a game patch without having the ability to inspect all the updates first before installing them on my computer. 4.I do not expect a game that as Medieval Total War II which runs exceptionally well to be destroyed by a new game which does not play well does not load well and does not represent the quality of game that I have come to expect from The Creative Assembly. Finally. In the old Medieval Total War days a group calling themselves the Lordz mad a mod for the old game which was called Napoleonic Total War. This game functions way better than the brand new and improved Empire Total War. To the members of the Creative Assembly. Please forget about meeting deadlines and the bottom line of how much more money you are going to make by delivering a game by the deadline. Give the gamers the kind of game they have come to expect from you in the past. A game that delivers everything and stands for quality in gaming. It is what we expect from you and what your honor and integrity demands. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing land battles no tactics needed whatsoever and if you crash one ship into another nothing really happened the AI tries to slow your ships down when it thinks your going to crash as well so where is the control !!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's the best game, I've ever played! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Incredibly bad, nearly non existent AI ensures this game will get a very low score from me.The "professional" reviewers should truly be ashamed of themselves. Likely, they are $miling all the way to the bank though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am writing this to alert people once again at how bad this game is. Never mind how bad it was at launch, I will tell you my experience as of the last CA patch, when they announced they would no longer be patching this game.

I played the campaign long enough to play a single battle. I was defending a fort from an enemy assault. Mere seconds after the battle started the opposing AI ran his general out, sweeping across his front lines, and opened fire on my fort with his cannons....directly through his general's unit, thereby killing his own general within about 15 seconds from the battle start. Probably trying to cut around my fort at my reinforcements behind and to the left of the fort.

That was the start, then about a minute later I had moved my two reinforcing units up to flank the attacking force, when the AI decided it would meet my reinforcements head on with a cavalry charge. I had elephant cavalry and some sort of hybrid ranged/melee unit, so I switched my ranged unit into melee mode, and counter charged, relying on the elephant cavalry to break the enemy charge and my other unit to overwhelm them. Then I switched back to manage the assault on my fort, which was going well for me, only to switch back to the conflict outside my fort to find that while my elephant cavalry had charged, my other unit had not. At first I thought I had misclicked, but come to find out, when I had put the unit in melee mode, it froze in place. I couldn't move it. I had to toggle it back in forth multiple times before it "fixed itself" and I could move it again, but only in ranged mode.

As my general was part of the now gutted elephant cavalry, I was actually at risk of being routed. I held the fort, but the AI was reforming for another attack, and all I had to stop his cavalry outside the fort was a unit that I couldn't switch from ranged mode or it would stop moving. Meanwhile his cannon had done serious damage to my wall. Reviewing the damage I realized his cannon were no longer firing, why not? Well, that is because the AI decided to abandon his cannons, which still had plenty of ammo, and charge the fort with his cannoneers, while his other units stood and watched. The marched right up to the walls, where I had local number superiority, then broke and ran, as did the rest of the forces. Giving me the victory.

Realizing battles where not a test of skill, but a test of whether the gameplay crippling bugs the player experiences are worse than the horrible, suicidal. AI, I stopped playing then and there and have not touched the game since. i honestly think anyone who rates this game a 10/10 is either being paid, is not a gamer at all, or is playing on such easy difficulties they don't really notice how terrible things are. keep in mind, my experience, was post the last CA update, after they had "fixed" the game.

TLDR: As of final patch, game was still broken with massive bugs and a non functional AI. Not worth playing, not to mention paying for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It didn't starts anyway i try to. When it starts then it crashes many times. So i give two  points for at least the graphic and those few minutes i could play it  . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rate this good game so low because i always get stuck in the middle of a campaign when the game crashes at a certain point. i can´t continue and would have to start a new campaign - this does not make sense. i will return the game to the shop, where i bought it. sorry, could be a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok who lets this game out of beta? Seriously this thing crashes more that a blindfolded drunk driver! The graphics on low and medium settings are horrible I keep seeing units made of stick figures. Note to CA some of us need to buy food and housing we don't have a pile of cash to blow on hi-end graphics cards. And linking this to steam wtf now I can't even try to sell this disaster and recoup some of my money!! And I'm not even going to start with the game play issues I just don't have that kind of time. Good job CA you managed to kill the total war franchise and make sure I never buy another product of yours again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tragically, this is an outstanding game plagued by a 1st rate battleship full of bugs, CTD errors and in my opinion unforgiveable game playweaknesses which could all have been ironed out with a proper Beta. The game frequently (every hour or so) crashes to desktop during naval or land battles, and after about 20-30 turns the game will reach a point where it crashes during the AI turn on the campaign map, and when you reload the saved game it crashes in the same place...with no work around. This leaves your campaign dead in the water, and you have the choice of starting a fresh campaign or just not playing it any more. Really dissappointing, as I've been playing this series since Shogun and bought a new PC just to enjoy this game - wish now I'd spent a week on a beach instead! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had the possibility of being awesome, but it crashes every 10 mins, it's slow as can be (even on a quad core 6600, 8GB of RAM, GeForce 285, 3.5 TB of hard drive space). There is no way this game should receive the praise it's been getting. This is utterly unstable and unplayable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game expecting a great follow-up to the previous TW series. MAny of the ideas in the game seem well thought-up, but the game is so bug-ridden and have so poor campaign and combat AI that it needs more than a few small patches to fix it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A game full of bugs. You're not able to play this game without crashes and other bugs that make the gameplay horrible! Thank you CA!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Activating the game just sucks. A bad strategy for such renowed marks as SEGA, Creative Assembly, and the Total War branch. That Steam thing idea is so weird that I never more want to see it again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was riddled with bugs from day one. They promised features that were scrapped after a delayed release. They still have not fixed people hacking online, basically ruining any attempt at competitive play. Their staff even posted in a blog that they were not happy with the game on release, even going as far as saying they were ashamed to send copies to their friends. Creative Assembly has shown that they continue to move in the wrong direction with the total war series, and are malicious towards their customers. With that said, the game is enjoyable for a campaign or so, but really lacks in any tactical depth and AI capability. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The 2 is for creating the greatest strategy game ever made. Then knowing its incompleat and unfinished selling it to thousands of people expecting a finished game. Why would anyone ever assume that someone would want a game that isn't ready? As far as I'm concerned these pricks stole from me. The Total War games was something that if you liked strategy games you knew your 60 bucks were well spent. Now their name means nothing. Imagine if you bought a 2000 computer, brought it home and it worked for 2 days then wouldn't start again... Then they told you that it's buggy and there is a patch that will come out in 6 months so you can use your new $2000 computer. That computer store would be sued and bombed. This is what Creative Assembly has done. Sold a product that wasn't finished and after you have spent your hard earned money then you have to wait till they get around to compleating it over the next while(if they do). It's a slap in the face. If I spend 70 bucks on an x box or playstaion game at least I know it will work. If they sold games that didn't work they would go out of business. I hope everyone that bought this game holds the creative assembly responisble for there theft of our money and never buys another product from them again... Theres a big market out there for good strategy games and someone will take there place once there banko. We have to show these guys and other game makers this is unacceptable!!!!!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unbelievable....and totally unacceptable. I have been an avid Total War fan since its inception and been looking forward to playing Empire for many a long month. I am fed up with the game crashing and am totally bemused with the link up with Steam, what an awful partner to share such a great title product. I have shelved the game on a number of occasions but my love of its predecessors has always brought me back but only to disappoint time after time. The final product is not fit for purpose, the two is given out of loyalty, my advice, BEWARE this product is below the quality of its fore fathers. My message to the magazine critics, 'shame on you', rate the gameplay, not the concept. To CA/SEGA - give me back my money, and I went for the Special Forces Edition. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I decided to hold off on reviewing Empire even though I bought it off Steam on release day.   It was broken and nearly unplayable on release due to the near total absence of AI opposition.  The AI was so bad that it couldn't even land armies off ships.  In short, this meant that island nations like the UK were unbeatable when played by the gamer, and worthless when acting as an AI opponent.

Patch 1.4 FINALLY came out after six months, promising to fix the AI.  Well, it's still crap.  Not as crap on release, but still so utterly useless that it robs any enjoyment the player might have had were the AI even remotely competent.  
It's a slap in the face to the consumer that the game was shipped in such a terrible state, a further slap in the face that the slowly released patches have done little to ameliorate the many problems, and a final slap that CA has decided to devote their efforts into wringing more money out of dupes like me via questionable DLC and worthless expansions like Napoleon.

Why would I care about Napoleon:TW when the base game is in such a crap state? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What sham this game turned out to be. Poor performance, bugs out the wazoo, horrific AI and the developer has already given up on to make their next killing with Napolean Total War. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Full price for a beta game? My god i really hope that software law is changed so stuff like this stops happening because if it was the case i would have returned this game within the first day it was terrible. It was worse than a beta game, atleast beta testers dont have to pay to play a game they end up having to tell the devs to fix. I Gave it a 5 due to its sort of turn around since 1.5 but as CA have said themselfs no more major patches coming which is definatly not what this game needs as 1.5 fixed alot of problems but brought new ones to the table as did every other patch they released, you know what im dropping it to a 2 due to CA's pathetic attempt at ''not fixing'' covering up their mistakes. Just to note, If you want a better Meta score CA, make a better bloody game you con-artists. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has been entirely unplayable for months due to a crash bug introduced in a patch. The AI was extremely weak when it was playable and instead of fixing the game, they decided to go on and make their next one. I would not recommend this for purchase. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, so this game is unfinished crap basically. Not just the bugs and performance issues but other more serious gameplay issues as well. Pathfinding for one, it probably features some of the worst pathfinding in a game ever. What's the deal with not being able to place formations next to objects in battles? And fort combat is simply hilarious, you're actually in a disadvantage as a defender since your buggy tropps CANT FIRE OVER THE WALLS EFFICIENTLY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The official review score is a total shame. The gamer's review score is closer to reality and it should even be a much lower score. Same old philosoply coming from Sega is a real disappointment. Selling an unfinished product is totally unacceptable. The game is a bug in itself. It will mess up your computer and slow down anything you do with it. Looking at the so called "reviews" from the official reviewers like gamespy makes me want to throw up on them. I'm proud to say that I never supported gamespy and will ONLY support them when they stop this nonsense "review". DO NOT buy this and support only publishers who deliver a product that works. Boycotting should be the name of gamer's game from this point on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Steam is a steaming great t**d. All the effort at making a game that could sprint of into the halls of fame and they go and chain it to a wall of useless! Steam crashes, it irritates, it dictates and makes you wonder if Empire: Totalwar is worth the hell. Some say yes, I say I can live without it as cons outway the benefits of playing an otherwise polished game with only minor faults to gameplay. Steam has left me fuming. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Total war games, Rome and Medieval 2 have never left my hard drive since i installed them, but I have to say that empire total war is an abomination of Total war games   First of it takes way to long to load, the grand campaign is more of a course in micro management then an actual game, and the campaign AI do F-all in the way of attacking me. The sea battles do redeem the game a bit, but as the only highlight this is very poor. The Battle AI is more likely to glitch and send a single file of men against you then have tactics, and the hanging point of battle is supposed to be the musketeers, but it takes a couple of volleys from your WHOLE ARMY to destroy one unit. The garrison able buildings and forts are a poor replacement for the cities and castles of earlier games and provide the enemy with an easy target more then give you any defensive value. Cannons would be helpful in battles if they killed more then 3 enemy units a shot. Overall a sad disappointment after the previous games, this game has a boring grand campaign, HORRIBLE AI, ineffective units and repetitive battles. ALSO ALL THE UNITS LOOK THE REALLY SIMILAR! WTFs UP WITH THAT?! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played TWS2 for over 350 hours, which is not nearly as much as I played RTW or M2TW. I played a campaign with every clan, except the Ikko Ikki, when I got that dlc I was already bored out of my mind with Shogun2. There are simply not enough differences between the factions to keep me interested, I think this game is better than Napoleon (that's not much of an achievement though) and nowhere near as good as RTW and M2TW were.I think it's highly overrated, replayability isn't very high and another bad point is that they swapped the modding community for dlc.For me personally it was the last CA game I'll get. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game reminds me why I still play Rome Total War and Medieval Total War 2.  I feel like I'm an eight year old playing an eight year old's strategy game with beautiful graphics.  I played the game for about thirty hours.  Found it boring.  Went back to Rome and Medieval with Europa Barbarorum and Stainless Steel mods.  If you like shallow strategy games, this one's for you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I recently obtained a copy of Shogun 2 and was expecting a similar format and playing platform as the other total war games. I was not so lucky. I now have to play a game over the inter-net and before I can play said game I have to down load it on to a web host from a DVD (which at last look had taken 9 hrs due to the updates) - whats the point?  I now have 20 Gb of memory used that ia useless to me without an inter-net connection.
If the graphics are as good as Medieval 2 then I am sure it will be a great play but not being able to play without being connected to the inter-net and all the cost and grief that produces is to this player a major failing for the player who wishes to play securely. Before any one shouts all content on line is corruptible and accessible - a pc not connected is safe.
Why change the playing platform that has worked in earlier gasmes 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well that was disappointing. How has the series moved on since Rome and Medieval total war? Not a lot really, same game different lick of paint. Adds nothing new what so ever. I have to say something about the engine too, there has been no improvement as far as I can see, It runs like a dog. If they released the same game but optimized it so that you could actually have the epic battles that would be forgivable. Multi-player just turns into a slide show.  Got this on a steam sale and really wish I hadn't. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of Rome or Medieval 2 cheap, they beat the heck out of this re-skin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

multiplayer is totally broken. games are not starting because the amount of money spent is calculated in a wrong way. people do not see each others lobbys and many many more bugs. obviously, no pc magazine tested that mode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel sorry for the poeple who have paid for this game (like my friend Steve). They are the only ones penalised by the DRM. Visuals are a bit better than San Andreas, but its a con. All of the great features of San Andreas were removed (no training, no silent kill). Too dumbed down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game presents inferior quality compared to the ones prior to him. There is a feel of emptyness from the start to the end. You dont have half the choices you had in San Andreas, the world is smaller, more boring, the story is far worse, there are so many characters that you end up forgeting who is who and missing half of it. It feels like San Andreas story is more non-linear than IV's, even though IV's is supposed to be made non-linear in some way. It is incredibly repetitive. The whole game end up being "going from point A to point B", there is no other reason to do anything else. Graphics are good, but at what cost? hell, they are not only incredibly heavy but also incredibly buggy! The radios are awful, they cannot be compared to any of those of any GTA that came before this one. Another thing that is just outrageous is the quantity of stereotipes there are in the game. From the main character, a russian immigrant, to radio programs talking about terrorism and stuff and the "american dream". Also, DRM protection ends up screwing up all the rest of the things the game had. Let alone all the things you have to do in order to play it (*cough social club and windows live cough*). The only thing done right in this game are the little details. Cars not turning on, deformable cars, etc. Although as i said, some of them are absolutly useless. (like taking a cab, the stupid shows you can go watching, etc). However this is not nearly enough to make IV a good game. All of what this game is made of is hype. A major step back from San Andreas. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes graphics and physics good, but ability, scenario much worse than SA, never buy this game, do not made the same mistake! Try pirated version at least, there is nice working crack with some bugs if you want!(AND majka not mother in russian LOL(you dumb polska) there are no NO problems(in word translate)"without problems in russian" either!). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buggiest release of a major game I have seen on PC in as far back as I can remember. I can't play it more than 3-4 minutes without it crashing and I can't get acceptable frame rates on a machine that exceeds the requirements. The only reason to rate this game a 2 and not a 1 is that it might eventually be fixed. Rockstar has been extremely unhelpful in the meantime and their press releases have been full of doublespeak. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I heard nothing but bad things about this game. I have a pretty high end computer and it runs like crap at medium high settings. You have to have a card with 6846541867MB of texture memory to max out the draw distance. The install took years, even compared to GoW(one of the longest game install I have had). Your graphics card almost has no effect on the gameplay, no SLI/X-Fire support, more bugs than an insect exhibit at a zoo and needs a 12GHz quad core to handle the terrible excuse for a port of sloppy coding that was likely done overnight. I could only get ~20 fps on mediums settings with a 3.2GHz quad core at 1024*768. This game is terrible. I was so disappointed by the game performance, install time, size and 1300 things I had to sign up for I uninstalled the game the same day. I might consider purchasing it later if they can fix the bugs, add multi GPU support, fit it on one disk and clean up the sloppy code. Just because people are using quads and 4+GB of RAM is no excuse to make sloppy pitiful ports. Rockstar has lost a lot of support from this port. I think they should have not have hired chimps to code the game. The graphics are nice and that is all I can say positive bout the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst ports ever. I know they have a deadline but you can't treat your customers like this. We have waited for so long for this game to come on the PC and a few more months wouldn't kill us. Now that i have the game and i can't play it the frustration is even bigger. I really hope that for the next GTA title R* will wake up and realize that in the end the satisfaction of the customer matters and we deserve some respects especially because we bought this game and didn't run to pirate bay to download it. I hope a patch comes that will fix this problems before new year... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Words cannot describe how disappointing and annoyed this game has made me. Not only does it have the most painful install experience I have ever encountered, it takes 10minutes to load every time you play. Then the textures and buildings dont show up. Unplayable. It is also necessary to navigate through the awful rockstar *social* club interface each time the game is loaded. The social club is also set by default to load on startup. Avoid until this is patched. I cannot emphasis this enough. Really, what went wrong? Not cool Rockstar. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very Disappointed

They've messed up real life simulation and fun game play. The whole game feels like a drag. Emotionally unstable protagonist which most of the times does not represent what the player wants/feels. Story-wise everything feels schemed. Majority of the characters are being killed/disposed off before you even know them. You play for around 20hours into the story to find out the real story behind it all, which in fact, is very poor. Thinking about spending time and building relationships/friendships? Absolute waste of time. Girlfriends are getting discarded like flies through "Storytelling". Constant drama and personal-family affairs are just horrible representation.

Game-wise. Graphics are mediocre at best. They've pulled this strange, and rather unwanted, dirt-brown filter onto everything, to simulate a dirty (real life?) city. To say the least it all fails. The game was designed for a console. With limited resources and computational power in mind. And this version of the game in just a port, and a cheap one, they didn't even bother implementing anti-aliasing into the game. No matter that, knowing it's 5years old game, and the availability of graphical enhancers around this is all semi-fixable, and can be disregarded by majority.

Mechanics. The physics, AI, and other inner mechanics are very poor designed, if they were designed at all. Vehicle controls are as crappy as ever. Especially every other car that you aren't driving. Motorcycles flying into the air like balloons on every impact. Inflammable cars with a touch of a finger. Cars no longer have fuel tanks apparently. You have to shoot the rims of the car for it to get a blazed and explode. Forget about flat tires. Firing at tires does nothing. Shoot the rims for effect. which goes in three stages apparently. Flat tire -> broken rim -> car in flames. No purchasable safe-houses. No property ownership with benefits. Just story set crappy apartments forces upon you. I recall parachutes and jet packs in previous game installments, non of that here. No "gang members" recruitment. You can't call out for someone to help. Missions scripts are more broken than ever. Sometimes it feels like you have to perform brain-surgery operation to get in place for mission to progress.

Overally. Having played Vice City, and getting very amazed back in the day, it was improved and topped up with creativity with San Andreas. But, as it seems, they decided to literally downgrade the game for "reality feel". They've removed so much it is unbelievable this game was in production so long. No car customization, no garage, you can't call a ballet to bring you your car. They've spent so much time and effort into rag-doll simulation and animations things just fly by while you are trying to enter a vehicle. Muscle, stamina have been removed. Character customization is just non-existing. You have Niko Bellic as he is. You can buy him a nice suit. That's about it. The whole experience feels like stripped down game. It is rather ironic that throughout the game there are multiple references and mentioning of Vice City, and how much better things are there.

Conclusion. This review is based on completing the game. I am not one of those who played couple of hours and made their conclusions. Being GTA fan for a decade it is really a shame that such a franchise ended up in such state. It is all down the hill from now on. I am really afraid even taking GTA5 in my hands. Thinking that it will be just like GTA4 with three Niko Bellics running around. Not recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried valiantly to get into this, since I have been a devote fan of the GTA franchise since I first fired up top-down GTA ever so many years ago. However, I have some fairly sizable complaints. And I feel they're likely shared by others...

While the in-game graphics are lovely, and my rig handles in-game play with ease  even at higher detail  I noticed immediately that the cut-scenes are the herky-jerkiest mess of nausea-inducing graphical horror imaginable. If my machine can handle maxed out graphical settings in-game, why in the world are cut-scenes such a dreadful chore to render?

Vehicle controls are not just modestly too realistic, they're OVERLY realistic: Making the game feel more like work than an escape probably wasn't the best course to take here. The higher-end cars would seem to be the way out of this quagmire, yet they actually magnify this effect. They're not stogy and unresponsive, no, but they're overly twitchy and even less fun to pilot.

I've played some disappointing Rockstar games in my time, but this one easily tops the list. I say this only having played for a few hours, but I can't honestly think of anything I'd rather continue doing less than muddle through this fiasco.

If you're eagerly awaiting GTA 5 for the PC and are seriously thinking of purchasing this to fill your wistful, empty hours until it is finally released to us PC plebs, I implore you not to bother.

I'd honestly rather replay one of the decent GTA releases, GTA:VC  including the impossible RC helicopter missions and ridiculous "try until you want to cry" boat missions  all the way through again, rather than continue with this shambolic offering an hour longer.

For shame, Rockstar. For shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't get it. I just don't get it. This game does not deserve the 98/100 critic score on 360, even without the problems of this horrible PC port, the game isn't that great. Is Rockstar paying off reviewers for high scores? This game is boring. Sure the story is engaging, but 90% of the time you're just driving around a city. It takes itself too seriously, sure the world has some goofy stuff, but the story of the game is too dark and serious, look at Saint's Row, it's cheesy and over the top, that's funny. And now GTA5 has a 98/100 too, and that's depressing. People go after CoD for this all the time, but every GTA game is the same, you drive around, kill people, do missions. There's so many better games out there that just came out that aren't getting any attention, Rayman Legends for instance, that game tries so many fresh ideas, and it works. But gets no attention. This is truly sad for the gaming community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst entry in the GTA series yet. It completely drops the premise of fun in favor of "WE SERIOUS GAME ABOUT FEELINGS NOW". I'm sure it's very deep to especially dense 6th graders. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Points for the fantastic graphics, but unfortunately, the game is so painfully laggy that it's beyond the point of being playable. Even after trying everything to fix the situation, this game just doesn't want to cooperate with my PC. Hopefully, Rockstar is able to avoid these kind of bugs in future games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off. terrible port even with my core i5 4570 and amd 7870 the game lags like  The textures are just so bad same with meshes in doors. And the story line is just the same  over and over do this go do that bla bla all you do is drive there do that then do it again its boring as hell. I hope they actually optimize GTA V for pc this time instead of spending 2 mins porting it to pc 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's bad. It's boring. It's broken.
Now, autumn of 2014, i7-2700 (3,4GHz Quad), 16 GB RAM, Geforce 970 (Maxwell 2), Win8.1-64, SSD: The game does not stutter anymore. Maybe unless you use the X-Box-controller, that is.
Now, you can see GTA4 in its full glory. And it is bad. Graphics? Dated. Well, they were already dated when the game was released in 2008, but hardly anybody noticed that, as nearly everybody was just overwhelmed by the sheer size of the city. Music? No, just awful noise. Dialogues? Do you consider F-words and S-words a bearable dialogue? In that case you do not have a problem with the game. You do have a problem with your life. Missions? Try to navigate a horrible car through a horrible mess of horrible AI and kill someone. Repeat.
The good news is: The triggers in the game can be broken, so you cannot start the next mission. What about other savegames? It is GfWL - no escape here. The game essentially gives you a "Game over" for free. Thus the game has a useful message after all: Go and play something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

same game play mode in the entire game, you spend more time traveling to the mission than completing it, the only challenge games are the minigames, even the dates are repetitive. Obviously the high rates was for the graphics and free run mode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game doesn't deserve anybody's money. I had to download 5 different applications, register to many clubs before even being able to play it, and after that i still got a error message. Then when i started the game, and changed the resolution and refresh rate (1600x1200, 85 Hz) The screen went black saying "Sync out of range", so clearly, my screen can't handle that much of refresh rate, but the thing is, i couldn't not change them back since all I could see was black. Absolutely ridiculous. After few weeks when not getting any useful help from rockstar, i had to think of something. Then, i thought maybe i should take few screenshots of the menu, and it worked. The screen was black, but i could take screenshots of it. This way i was able to navigate through the menu with sounds and pictures. The game itself is great, buggy and heavier than crysis, but after that much of trouble, it doesn't matter how good the game is. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is undoubtedly fantastic on XBox 360 or PS3, but don't buy it for PC! It has inane copy protection, no customizable keyboard controls, and ridiculous system requirements to run at a decent frame rate. It is thoroughly disappointing! Don't buy it!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game on xbox 360 but i wanted it to get on pc only beacause of the playability, the highest resolution and the ''more fps'' but i was really disapointed. the game itself is awsome but i currently have xp professionnal 2.5 g of ram a sli 8800 ultra and a quad core 3.6 ghz and i have BIG troubles get more then 40 fps in mid graphic settings. THE GAME IS MORE HEAVY THAN CRYSIS!?!?!?!? and there is no, even in max graphic settings, comparaison between the two games in term of graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First I had problems installing it, it had a bug in the installation proccess, I 've had to open a support thread. Only then after one month I was told that I was forced to install Microsoft Marketplace manually, I had to create two accounts. One "RockStar Club"  and a Microsoft account. It found it very annoying.
I expected more for this game. I found the controls too hard to grasp at first. The graphics is still very good. But I didn't have as much fun as I had with previous GTA. It is for sure a worst GTA. I'd say the experience was bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

not sure about the game, but if you want to play, you have to spend at least an hour getting behind some drm crap, creating microsoft live profile, rockstar games profile, restart the game 5 times, authentize mail and so on. definetely not recommended to anyone who just want to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nicely done but becomes a little repetitive after a while. There should be more around the story, or more interesting missions than just go and shoot a bunch of people to steal something. Yet, it's addictive and characters are quite developed with clear cut personalities (Little Jacob is AWESOME!).
However, after playing for 60 hours, I'm struggling real bad with some missions, after retrying them for like 20 times. No way to skip them, no help, it SUCKS! I'm so fed up to redo the same things again and again and have Nicko not respond to what I ask him to do, ending up dying in the most retarded ways ever. I give up. It ruined my game experience so bad that I now hate the game. Well done Rockstar for not putting any save-points for the long missions and force the player to do the same things during 30 minutes every time, again and again, for nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a shame! I have a i7 oc to 4.4ghz and a gtx295 oc by 24% and the game graphics glitchy, the only game I have that does this. Even if I reduce the oc's or remove them altogether its still the same but worse. Nice idea, controls are poor and very clunky. Its as if you were a puppet master controlling strings that actually control the controls....if that makes sense, as if you are far removed. Not so bad when you're walking but fighting is a joke and driving is unrealistic. Completed 4 missions then deleted it, waste of £5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was tempted to go on an angry rant, but I want to be objective and fair here. Overall, there will be one thing I will *never* forget and always associate with this game. It has one supercritical flaw: -It runs like sh*t- I'm not exaggerating one bit. Ive been building and repairing pc hardware for over 10 years now, and have always been an avid gamer. I play many brand new titles and have few problems, often able to play 1900x1200 with every option enabled including antialiasing and plenty of texture post-processing on other new titles such as All source games (including L4D, TF2 etc.), Fallout3, Mirror's Edge and the list goes on... Obviously this is not because my hardware is not up to task. This is one of the worst pieces of software I've ever encountered. The game is very, very, VERY poorly programed. To boot, GTA IV doesn't even look good. The graphics look very dated in comparison with titles released recently. It crashes... alot. This program has managed to generate more faults and errors than any other application I have ever installed. I'd even go so far as to say known malware runs more stably. I wish I was exaggerating, but this is the sad, sad truth that is GTA IV for PC. I attempted for days to improve the performance and stability of this program using every workaround and trick I know of including: 1) trying over a dozen different combinations of drivers 2) both versions of the game 3) manually editing nearly every configuration in the program directory 4) multiple OS's (vista and XP pro) 5) multiple bios and firmware combinations 6) alteration of my OS (killing services, disabling/enabling access, security, automatic memory remapping apps, cache utilities) 7) I even cleared out enough room on my scsi 15k rpm HDD... No effect on performance. (Oh let me add that the install directory is rediculous. 15 gigs!? of *what* may I ask?) 8)multiple brand new graphics cards including an ATI 4850 overclock addition (asus) and XFX nvidia geforce 9800. Did any of this work, at all? Actually, somewhat. But the performance is unbelievably bad even when I take the best results from all of the above. Given the Xbox 360's hardware, (http://hardware.teamxbox.com/articles/xbox/1144/The-Xbox-360-System-Specifications/p1 if you're curious) most modern PC gaming rigs shouldn't break a sweat running this software. However, my problems with this awfully coded mess are not isolated, but rather the typical experience. Ludicrous. How did rockstar miss these problems? Greater than 50% of users are having awful issues, how many different pcs did they playtest this on? One? None? Grand Theft is an apt title. I feel no better than grifted, swindled and conned for purchasing this garbage. The programmers should be truly ashamed. Rockstar has also made no attempt to repair their broken software nor have they even *acknowledged* that these severe issues exist to this degree. The finale of this ridiculum is that once I was able to stabilize the software to the point that I could play through an appreciable portion of the game, it was really pretty average. The gameplay is alright... Pretty similar to san-andreas, with the notable exception that the animations are vastly superior. You are able to traverse objects a little better, and the cover system does add some substance to combat. I'd give the gameplay a 7/10, its decent, but still sort of the same old thing. Vehicle mechanics are really very good, with notable attention to realistic traction, but the general physics still have a very toy like, very poor quality. They really didn't think outside the box too much, alot of the mission content is completely rehashed from the original GTA III engine titles. The plot is actually pretty good, and the voice actors seem to be above average. Its pretty entertaining plot wise. Nearly all of the new content additions are terrible though. The cellphone is an abomination. People bother you on your cellphone too much. I hate this in reality, let alone in a leisure activity. I don't want people calling me all the time and being obligated to do what they ask me. I can only play the stupid ingame pool once or twice before it becomes extremely tiresome. To make it worse, you're punished for not doing this by losing reputation. Dating a computer character? Give me a break, this doen't even resemble fun. A virtual internet complete with virtual spam? What the hell did they bother spending time on this for? Does anyone actually appreciate this? Its really *not* clever, I wish they would have spent this time play testing this garbled up mess of code. -Bottom Line- This software is almost completely broken, and riddled with issues. It barely works. To quote the great philosopher James Rolf (AVGN), "What a sh*tload of f*ck" It comes packaged with all this bloatware that makes irritated as well. I don't use 'windows live' for anything, and its nothing but a marketing ploy with no substance. 'Rockstar Social Club' is equally useless or worse, as I suspect these applications present very serious security flaws. They run scripts and leave open ports, and I feel there is a high likelyhood that these applications will be exploited as entry points. Its really just the insult added to injury. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst PC port ever made. The game runs horrible on my high end desktop. Its unbelievable that a huge company like rockstar could produce something like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible graphics because of lack of AA. Jagged edges everywhere. Your vid card, no matter how high end, is useless. This game has NO option to enable AA, which it so desperately need. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It sort of works in single player, multiplayer doesn't work at all so far. Was finally looking forward to being able to mouse/keyboard this sweet game, but they botched it pretty bad. And since i bought it on steam, I need my steam ID, windows live ID AND rockstar social club ID for multi (which crashes when logged into social club). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

bugs bugs bugs. thats treyarch for you. connection problems(internet gets disconnected when u start game, if youre using vista you cant join xp games in coop and there arent much vista users compared to xp users, you get disconnected by the server randomly in multiplayer games, unhandled exception caught disconnection problems), sound driver conflict problems, disapearing favorite server problems, startup problems, internet disconnection problems(COD WAW tweaks the network settingsand you have to wait 5 minutes to reset the modem) installation problems, hardcore mode overpowered dogs, and did i mention bugs? congratulations on your bugfarm treyarch. i wasted $50.00. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a software engineer at a company that makes software quality assurance products, I feel I can speak with some authority when I say the PC release of GTA4 is a colossal failure by either Rockstar's QA department or management. The game itself is quite good, but the workmanship is by far the worst I have ever seen on a game I have beta tested, much less a final product. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its just a shame what Rockstar did to his good old pc-community. i bought it, but it defenetly was my last gta i paid for. Why are they making that deal with Windows? Why realasing an unfinished port? The game feels old and isnt working smoothly, on a high end system. the steering isnt adjusted to a pc-steering with mouse and keys, u cant really handle the car, because its impossible to control the speed proberly. what makes it even worse is that it just support the x-box controller (Microsoft!!), those bold capitalist doesnt deserve the money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unplayable. Apparently the "critics" are more than willing to give high marks to a game that barely functions due to bugs. The fix is in between the "professional critics" on this site and Rockstar games...sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played this for a couple of days but now it's listed on ebay where I will try to recoup as many of my losses as poss.  I finally gave up after the 10th crash to desktop.  I wasn't even enjoying the bland missions anyway so it wasn't worth the hassle of rebooting the game every time.  Avoid- even with a high end PC. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fantastic game. If you can actually play it. Don't dignify Rockstar with paying for this if you can help it. They don't deserve to be paid for such horrendous optimization. "Ah, but I want to play multiplayer!" Says the one whom would rather buy it. Knock yourself out - too bad everyone you'll be playing with will get consistently dropped from the game due to having a poor framerate on their quad-cores. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I haven't bothered trying to play the game beyond the very start because the performance is just so abhorrently bad. This is as far as I know the only game in existence where lowering resolution and textures does virtually nothing at all for performance.

In addition to that we have securom and nagging applications needed for the game to even function. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have every reason to believe there is a great game in here somewhere. Unfortunately, the ludicrous system requirements that in no way justify ok-but-not-better-than-everything-else-out-there visuals render the game almost completely on playable on all but the lowest settings, which makes the game look even worse. Don't buy this game. It's insulting to think people are changing money for a product that was clearly unfinished by uncaring designers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had fun at first, but before it ended the game became tedious and annoying.  This coupled with the amount of glitches and technical flaws that the PC version is littered with makes it almost too frustrating to play.  I'm a fan of the series but I'm very disappointed in this instillation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game looks bad on a Phenom w/ATI 4850. Same on Rockstar for releasing this game in the state it is. Look around the web and you'll see I'm not alone in having severe issues. I can run Fallout 3 in all its glory on my Samsung 226BW without a hitch but GTA looks worse than a PS2 game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have a 9800 GX2 OCX, a Liquid Cooled Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 running at 3.6GHZ. 4 gigs of Crucial Ballistix PC2-8500, and a EVGA 780i motherboard, and i cant seem to get over 14 frames per second. And for some reason the game wont let me use all 1 gig of video memory my card has, it says i only have 498mb?! And it restricts me from putting any of the settings higher if it uses over that amount. So all i got was a big laggy city with cars that drive like they are airboats. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Grand Theft Auto IV represents one of the worst attempts to make even mildly serious game in completely psychedelic franchise. Good job R*, you just ruined GTA.

Buggy PC port is also a serious issue. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game may be good but the crap you have to join and the waste of time working it all out is beyond stpid. Spend an hour loading everything before getting to play, and then it wouldnt save my game becasue something hadnt gone right. Sheer stupidity, though more likely arrogance 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DON'T DRINK THE COOLAID! This game is down right terrible for PC. Does Splinter Cell: Double Agent for PC ring a bell to anyone? If so, then you already know what I'm talking about. 

If not, believe me when Joel and I tell you that this is a terrible PC port of the game. Do not buy it!! I AM WARNING YOU! 

I give it a 2/10. The two goes towards the marketing team for doing such a great job at over hyping this craptastic game. If it wasn't for marketing doing their job ridiculously well, I would have rated 1/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Concept is not too bad. game play doesn't seem to be as good as 2K12. Music is terrible... Which I thought it'd be better with JayZ being involved. Last but not least the game freezes on me every time I try to get out of the first game I've played with my new player. Very frustrating! I've had to play the first game like 4 times now. Ive finally give up. im thinking about returning it and using the $60 on something else... I'm kinda disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull and lifeless. Slow and repetitive gameplay, with disparate levels and retreads. Poor, unsaturated, depressing art direction. This is no mario. Its E-mario (emo mario) and a sad excuse for an indie game. I'm ashamed I played the demo and that this what gaming has become. I'll be playing the much more elegant and exciting Blade Kitten instead of this junk. If this was the only game in hell, I wouldn't play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

they could at least change the engine! this game is like CoD, except it has no competition and thus, no one complains about it being the same over and over 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to be honest, sometimes playing the game I feel cheated, maybe because it feels like EASports hasn't change since FIFA 10.
Well, they add more "social" but it also kills the fun of the game, they you have many choices of careers but at the end of the day a repetitive game becomes lame.
I'll give it a low score for been repetitive and boring at sometimes. Then we have a change in the commentators in Spanish... way to bring down the score EASports. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this on release day and have already got rid of it! I got fifa 12 last year and thought that was poor, I downloaded the fifa 13 demo and thought it was good..... however after buying it I realised there is a big difference between the demo and the actual game! Why? Its slow, boring and just the same as fifa 12. Fifa 09 and 10 for me where the best ones! But this is just crap! For example trying to make this game realistic .... is making it un realistic and not fun, afterall its a video game its suppose to be fun! I was 4 games into a season and 6 of my players were injured already!! Is this realistic? No! Its BS Also why do my players keep running into each other and falling over?? Whatever! This almost never happens! Having 15 shots on goal to the AI's 6........ AI wins the game! Again BS! Also why are most goals scored in the 45th, 90th minute?? This is just the same game, same engine just a different licence! Avoid! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game does not have a story as it simply just a football games, but EA can’t even do that right. Let’s start with the flow of the game. The passing and the movement of the players is actually alright, but the goalkeepers on the other hand are simply diabolical. The keeper seem to have this amazing ability to move from onside of the goal to the other in half a second from a shot from Messi which is simply unrealistic seeing that they said FIFA 13 is the most ‘realistic’ football game to date is really just embarrassing. This game is generally brought for the online play and was the second most bought game of 2012 so you would expect the servers to be to the best of its ability but no! They are constantly crashing and cannot cope with the millions of people that play online each day. Now let’s move on to the actual game play. We have covered the goal keeping so let’s move on to the tackling. To be far to EA the tackling is actually alright BUT how Messi can out jump Rio Ferdinand isn’t right in the slightest. The slide tackling can be incredible late causing you to foal them or it can make the cleanest slide tackles so it’s very inconsistent. The shooting again is very inconsistent. Cristiano Ronaldo could score a blinder from 40 yards but them miss a sitter from the 6ft yard box...It just doesn’t make any sense. Now for the worst thing about the game and that’s the passing. It so, so, so bad! You’d tell it to pass it one way and it will end up going to a completely different person, the direction of where you put the ball never really goes to actually where you want it.

Suitability: Age 3+
Addictiveness: This game can be VERY addictive so be careful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I decided to rewrite my review. I dislike this game for plenty of reasons, some of them being unbalanced game play, unrealistic game mechanics, awful career and online modes, COUNTLESS game braking glitches, scripted matches and performances designed to make you lose no matter what. Only on Fifa can you have 70 percent possession, 20 shots on target, hit the post 6 times only to concede a fluke goal in the last second and lose the game. The amount of times this has happened to me is incredible. Only on Fifa can you be winning a game, press start to manage your team and it completely lock up your console forcing you to turn it off and losing all your progress. Be a pro mode? It's designed so your team doesn't have any possession, making it incredibly frustrating because you can't get in to a game and it lowers your rating, yet another waste of time mode. Ultimate team? Designed to bleed every single penny out of you, nothing more, nothing less. The game is so incredibly broken that I find myself turning it off prematurely out of frustration every time I try and play it... I'll be spending my money on Pro Evo next thank you very much EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA sports have gone back 5 years with this title, player movement reminds me of FIFA 08..game is just a disgrace. Only reason i gave this game 2 is because manager mode is quite good until it gets boring. Matches are fixed also for instance im dominating a game, the opposition has had 3 players sent off...easy win?? think again!! i hit the post 3 times, van persie misses 4 sitters that an old crow on a zimmer could finish and then out of the blue my defence splits letting the opposition through to score a 90th minute 1 nil win!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rubbish game, EA haven't made any changes to Pro Clubs, its still a big let down at times. Many many changes such as custom kits and logos can be done and have been done in FIFA 12 as well as FIFA street, they just don't wanna give it all away, EA sicken me with their lack of commitment to their fans 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing new, same useless AI, glad to see all 20 premier league stadiums but they should of done that like 5 fifas ago. Defending is some **** impossible task which you would think make games more interesting and more high scoring, but in reality each game is pure frustration and not worth playing. Buy it only to play with friends on local multi-player, but otherwise avoid this game at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got this game free with my 360 and, I've got the say, the price is right. The graphics are average at best, the racing is boring and awkward and there's just no fun factor. If this is the best the 360 can offer in terms of racers, then Gran Turismo has no competition. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was a good game, lot of potential. The premises (and prOmises) were amazing: No grinding, no gating...
Sure, it would have needed some bit of changes and fixes here and there (the greatest being the lacking of a proper LFG tool), but it was overall pretty great for a new MMO.
But with the Lost Shores patch they trashed it all. They broke ALL their promises, they went against their own manifesto. They went for an HEAVY grind style, a terrible gear treadmill. On top of that, the economy is ruined and prices are a real problem, especially for new players. So, if you want to buy or craft something now you pretty much have to buy money from their shop, making this a Pay to Win game.
Really disappointed, it had potential, but now it's just another WoW clone, and WoW still does those things better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I haven't gamed much over the past decade, so I'm not "tired" of WoW-type style games like others might be. I started playing SWTOR earlier this year, and fell in love with much of it.. but with so many people checking out GW2 (and also a lot of questions about TOR's future), I decided to try it as well.  But... it's just not working for me.  I don't understand those who insist GW2's graphics are superior to TOR.  I heartily disagree.  Looking at the animations of my toon, looking at how he + other players appear.. to my eyes, it's just decades apart.. with what I see in GW2, it's literally something I might have seen 10+ years ago.  The scenary on GW2 is certainly well done if you go for that artistic style, but not good enough that I really care about "vistas".

I'm also just not that impressed with the gameplay.  Someone compared to the SW:TOR style of combat to "playing a piano" (in a dismissive/critical sense).  Well, I actually liked that... a lot.  I have 2 quick bars = 24 keys I use in literally every single warzone on TOR.  I'm constantly watching CDs + my opponents cast bar, working with LOS, and rotating through actions as appropriate.  In contrast, I think the 5 + a few buttons in GW2 makes combat extremely boring.  I auto-attack, occasionally evade, and hit whatever is off CD.  I really found it extremely boring to play, and quit after about an hour.  (Maybe console players used to smashing 1-2 keys will find it just fine?)

I love GW2's WvWvW layout though.  If there was a way to combine that with the SW:TOR's combat interface, I would be in heaven. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is nothing like Guild Wars. There is nothing to do after lvl 80. The pvp is embarrassingly bad. They just ripped off lotro and wow and called it a sequel to guild wars. Im dead serious the pvp is a joke and they dont even have guild halls.The world is way smaller and it turns into a grindfest rather quickly. the few limited skills they give you arent very imaginative and created no chance to make creative builds, you are pretty much stuck with the 4 or 5 skills that are decent. prepare to see tons of bots grinding away. good luck reporting there you will still see the same bots there day after day. lost shores was terrible and handled very poorly. please dont buy this game if you love guild wars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is at this point quite horrible. Over one year, nearly no additions. They added 'Living story', a giant flop: achievement grinding for empty rewards, a very very stereotype story. Next to that they are going on to the path to a grind: Ascended gear, Characterbound everything, Crafting... this game is becoming worse every single patch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game keeps being praised as the best thing since sliced bread and is not even up to par with current MMORPGs; you could say is only an online game and not an RPG. Over a decade ago, games like Ever Quest were able to create a sense of immersion and atmosphere, you could role play your character and every role had it's own play style and strategy. You where invaluable to your team and it felt rewarding. Now, almost 15 years later, this game is just a common button smasher, every character is the same but with a different paint coat. No "trinity" means that there is no strategy and everyone is a DPS class. Everyone looks the same, feels the same and you can reach the maximum level in 2-4 weeks. After that, all the exotic gear is the same thing for everyone. If you like exploration and discovering the maps then this game will have some temporary appeal to you, but the combat is horrible, dungeons are unrewarding and brutal, PVP is a Zerg fest and crafting is the worst I've seen. I am disappointed that this game can't compare to games 15 years old and is just some pretty graphics with no substance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After one year of playing GW2 I can tell you with honesty that this game is NOT what the developers told the public that they were going to create.
The game is top to bottom full of grind.
The combat is repetitive and boring.
Expect to Zerg when in open world events.
Expect to Zerg in WvW.
Expect terrible performance with top end hardware.
Expect most items that you would like to be in the gem store only(you can pay with ingame gold but the exchange rate is rediculous).
Expect one shots
Expect time gated content...yes you look at a timer for things to do....
Expect the worst story from an MMO ever, even the Living Story updates are akin to an episode of Scooby Doo.
Expect terrible class balancing

Expect these things because that is what you're going to get with GW2. Future updates will in all likelihood NOT change the core issues that are mentioned.
GW2 has no Guild Wars...yes not even guild halls. The game should be called Zerg Wars 2, the rise of Trahearne.

The positives are that the game does look pretty good. The world is well designed but that is all I can pretty much think of really 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will never understand why so many critics and people love this game both at the "good" beginning and now. I was never enthralled playing this game, the combat that was so widely heralded as amazing is just mashing five buttons. The only way to pvp is by queing for it which I find very odd in a game for in MMOs like SWTOR and WoW these races have reasons to fight, although here your servers just fight. All species work together in peace even though the beast characters are said to be savages. I was never into this game from the start of it, it just felt like another boring MMO with a bad combat system, and story which I could not care less about, just dragons invading cough cough Skyrim. This game is boring and offers nothing new to MMOs that others like WoW should copy or iterate. Do not buy into the hype of this game it is not worth it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is average at its best. But when you ding level 80, the game start to be boring real quick with lack of content. There's no progression or any reason to do PvE or PvP.

I had so high hopes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, i will try to be as impartial as i can be.

The game itself isn't really SO bad. I can't say it's innovative, anyway.

Only somebody who clearly didn't play enough different MMORPGs in his life can say this game is innovative.

The PVE is basically a re-adaptation of the "public questing" introduced by Warhammer Online and already more or less adopted by Rift.

The game on the first months feeled playable but on the end really empty, you had a various number of things to do to achieve a single thing:  lvl80 and achievement points.

What i really don't like about this game is the incredible overrating about it.

Seriously guys, did you even play anything else which wasn't complete crap?

This game is playable, but it's not awesome at all, it's just a mediocre readaptation of things already seen on a lot of different MMOs.

The thing that really makes me angry instead is the fact that EVERYBODY IGNORES that this is actually Not only a Item Mall freemium game (despite having a high retail price) But it's also pay2win, mostly on the beginning.

Is it really sufficient to hide the "money selling" behind a couple of steps you need to do... to make it completely invisible? people doesn't feel like the game is pay2win, they doesn't even seem to notice that is actually possible.

The whole game is full of anti-goldseller mechanics (like not being able to send money throught mail/ no direct trading avaiable) and they state it's because goldsellers spoils the game.

But, OMG, you are doing it!! you are selling golds, how can you say something like that when the only reason for doing that is not wanting to have competitors?

I'm seriously embarassed by a lot of things, several sites state this game as "free 2 play" while they state other games like Path of Exile as "item mall" games, SERIOUSLY?

Are they at least getting money for doing things as ridiculous as this one, i wonder?

By the way this game isn't either good or bad overall, if you force yourself to believe this is the best MMORPG of the moment you can maybe actually get to believe it, hopefully that's not true.

So try to open your eyes and notice that there are many other games offering better things at a lower prices than this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After the initial high scores were in, ArenaNet pulled a 180 and added as much grindy content as they could, including a gear threadmill.

An mmo with a no-grind policy that has more grind than most. A developer recently 'adjusted' their no-grind claim stating "it only applies to the levelling process". All other content besides levelling (which ArenaNet considers optional) is loaded with grind until it spills over.

And in their upcoming release, they added a new level cap disguised as 'Masteries' which requires players to grind away to unlock content? Sure, but it's not against their claims because technically, it's not levelling...

Steer away from this one and all future releases. It's a big bait&switch scam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible RvR system where the map is too big, Planetside 2 did it better tbh. Loot is boring, always crap, you craft your gear and then you're done...you don't even need to grind/hunt for gear. Event drops are crap too. Puzzle drops are even worse. Raids are a terrible bore because enemies have tons of health. Stat system is simple  there is no allocation and only a few secondary stats. The grind is pretty easy but boring because you have 4-8 skills and no tactics required to level in high level areas...you can just solo and mechanics and skill required is no problem. Gear is generic with no interesting abilities/stat variations.  GW2 is pretty though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

dis gaem is nut gud.
I enjoy pressing 1 and also 2 o9ver and over agin howeever, i dunt no wat the point is. I like da littel alien thi8ng it is cut but udder dan dat eets bad. 2/10 would unistall agin :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately, I fell for the overwhelming amount of great reviews for this game. After seeing that the game had "sold out" of digital download copies, I thought, "maybe this is the mmo to end all mmos." So I rush down to a brick and mortar store to pick up a hard copy, install, create an account. Within 8 hours I get an email telling me that some clown in China is trying to access my account....great! Anyhow, I launch the game expecting pure awesomeness. What I see is a graphical amalgamation of Wow and Aion, which works out pretty well, because if you average out the years in which those engines were put into play, then you come up with graphics circa 2007...that's generous. Everything else is completely predictable - kill this, collect that, don't worry about the story. This is what killed SWTOR in my opinion; you can't try to polish up the things you like about various MMOs, slap them together and expect a miracle. And that's what you see here - a little bit of WoW, Aion, Rift, SWTOR, and a few of the legacy items that made the first GW successful, but ultimately the game is devoid of any revolutionary mechanics. On the other hand, I've been playing The Secret World for a little over 2 months now, and besides the very few bugs remaining, it has captivated me from day one! Fantastic gfx, engrossing storyline, challenging skill system, the ability to be absolutely anything with the mere swapping of skills that are available to everyone. While it may not be for everyone, at least it advanced the genre so that people can see where we could and should be with these games. How fans tolerate the same mediocre fodder is beyond me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rather dislike a lot in this game. For all the hype, I expected a lot. However, the graphics are nothing to write home about, the story is not that enjoyable, and the combat system simply isn't engaging. I cannot recommend it enough that you try this game for 6-8 hours before buying it. Be sure to play it for a while, you'll notice many people are adjusting their reviews as time goes on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game play is boring and feels very disconnected.  When you die it sends you to the ground like your having a last stand which i found to be very frustrating and frankly just not needed.  As for questing it was a bit different which was nice but if you wanted to play alone and quest you can just count that out because its based on there being many people there to help you.  The games not bad if you've never played an mmo before but if you are a veteran it going to be the same thing you've seen everywhere else. I give it  a 2 because the graphics were good but it had nothing else going  for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one broken piece of software. So many events and dungeons are broken, preventing you from completing areas ... but you will throw away a couple of hours before you realies you have waisted  your time. No AUCTION house, well there is one but it's broken too. SHUT forums wtf? Bots, hackers and the list goes on. Worst of all, it's the same wolf just in different clothing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This quote from the Manifesto video doomed this game IMO:

"... in Guild Wars 2, it's your world. It's your story. You affect things around you in a very permanent way." "You are rescuing a village, that will stay rescued." I'll come right out and say it... Naaah. Not a chance, it's the same old, same old, never ending loop of quests. They have not come up with any solution for personalizing an entire MMO world to the player. Their main claim to revolutionary game design was a complete fabrication. That alone heavily drops the score for me. Secondly, the event system is very, very repetitive. Just as repetitive as any other MMO to date. They change who you are fighting, what you are fetching, what you are wiping off walls, and where you are, but you are still defending, fetching, and wiping just to move on and do it all over. Lastly, the personal story is level based so you must, MUST grind out on things that have no story, or a very weak on if any, in order to get to the meat of the story in the game. Bad design, personal story must level with the character so they can always progress. That right there made me stop playing because I was not going to WOW grind to get to play and enjoyable single player experience. Oh and don't try grouping with too many people because the overload servers can't keep parties on the same servers. Overall, Guild Wars 2 Is like a bargain bin CD of a bunch of niche MMO's. 50 classic games for $60, but really nothing in it to separate it from the competition and the lack of a goal makes it hard to press on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is amazing, everything thats been said abot how it is different and fresh is true. There is but one major disadvantage. Two years after the release and there are still tons of bugs. And they keep piling up with every patch. The more I play it the more bugs I find and people seem to be used to them. Honestly the amound is kinda ridiculous. As for fixing them that just takes ages... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is this game getting such high reviews? It takes a few hours but under the shiney wrapper tha flaws come quick and they are huge.
-Abilities are bland.
-Character development is non-existent.
-Combat invovles mashing same 4 to 5 buttons - you unlock a few more but I already mention the abilities are terrible - so you'll just mash 4 of the available 8.
-Gear is bland and generic- little variety - if you see someone of the same class odds are pretty high he's rocking same stuff you have. Lots of dyes but the underlying gear all looks the same.
-Crafting is pointless - you'll find the same gear - so nothing you craft is of any value on the auction.
-Local events are pointless Zerg fests mashin gthose 4 butons and wondering what if anything you did.
-NPC voices are poorly done and repetative.
-About as much depth as an episode of iCarly.

-SO I paid my $60 - leveled to 30 - uninstalled the game and took a long shower to wash off the dirty feeling from playing it. You have been warned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Guild Wars 2 looked to be a very hopeful game for me, a game I thought I would be playing for a decent 6 months or more, around the same timeframe I played WoW a few years back. The way the game was advertised was very well done, they made the game looks so clean and crisp, the graphics looked amazing. What they did was professionally iced a crummy cake. The game is very deceiving at first. The diverse character creation draws you in, and you choose what your characters going to be like, before you even experience them playing the game. I played human mostly, and made a guardian and engineer. After killing a few centaurs from some random town attack, I'm called in to help fight some massive rock hand that emerged from the ground. After joining the 10 other players that are smacking the rock with their daggers and bullets, the boss dies with like 5 minutes, and then my character passed out. I'm then told to help the town out with their daily chores, watering corn, feeding cows and destroying wasp nests. Wtf? What happend to all the centaurs, why did they even attack. To be honest, I think the storyline and moral behind all this is very generic and didn't really interest me at all. The skills are very limited, and get very tedious after a while. The skill/trait system is very dry, and didn't inspire me to go further at all. The instanced city ruined the whole 'epicness' and the teleportation system isn't a very creative way of travelling. WvW consisted of attacking a gate for 15mins before it was destroyed, and showed little potential for melee clases, as they got destroyed if they ran into a 20 man pack of players, all AoEing the ground and using their root abilities to pretty much ruin melee potential.  The last stand skill ruined pvp, as it always felt I had to kill the player twice, instead of a nice clean one shot. It was way too balanced as well, giving every class ability ranged and heal abilitys, there is no special "individuality" among the classes as they could all do similar things. The biggest reason I didn't continue though was the lack of potential. What was the point of hitting level 80, when you get the same benefits at any point of the game. They wanted to make the game balanced and fair, and they did. I got my money back on the game after playing the 3-day head start and a few days after that. If you've played WoW and loved it, don't play this game. This is all my opinion guys, many of you probably like the style of the game, but I guarantee you, after 6 months, this game will barely be heard of.

Released on April 5th, Vroom in the night sky was a nice little surprise for me. Cute anime hunnies, motorcycles and the worst Japanese translation ever….period! I thought that it’d be a really great game….and it sure was………. A game….  The whole point of the game is to ride your magical motorcycle, or chair through the NIGHT SKY and collect the floating star medals. Collecting all of the medals on the map will unlock the portal….but the only point of the portal is to take you back to the main menu. Along with collecting the EVER SO IMPORTANT STAR MEDALS you can collect stardusts….or whatever the **** they’re called. These magical space monies will let you unlock much faster motorcycles. That’s pretty much the whole game. Yep, just collecting the useless stardusts to extend your arsenal of space machines and unlock copy and paste maps. Although the game itself comes short in about every aspect. Plot…..Characters…….Dialogue…. There are a collection of tutorials that teach you how to play the game. You wanna know how to drift? There's a tutorial for that! You wanna know how to bounce off of the ground like a trampoline? There’s a mother****ing tutorial for that! I think that the best thing about the tutorials is that they teach you how to play a game that isn’t even worth playing! Not that there is anything to play…
Overall, I give this game 2 choking joey’s world tours out of 10. I think that it has the potential to be a really fun indie, but I don’t think that the devs really thought about making a game…...It’s pretty much a cute game with the added hd rumble feature. Oh and you can set the rumble feature to VIOLENT and stick it up your ASS! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In all honesty this was clearly rushed and is a very disappointing indie game, graphics were awful I mean it looks dreadful and is definitely the worst game on the Nintendo Switch so far, I have no idea why Nintendo accepted this game to be on the eShop totally not worth it maybe Nintendo was really in the need of the games and they still are.

Otherwise gameplay is just not up to standard as it should be this is a game you should avoid so please don't waste your money on this title. "Vroom in the night sky is a magical bike action game." Well from my experience it wasn't really magical but those are Nintendo's words. Just don't buy it, simple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The control methods used in this version of the game for Wii render it totally unplayable. This game looks and plays more like a badly written budget game and I am very surprised Ferrari would even put their name to the Wii version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad. It's very very bad. I'm not comparing it to big consoles versions and downgraded to floor-level graphics is not worst part, but re:r on 3ds was much better than this though it was much weaker console. Worst part is optimisation. When you got severally hit it becomes complitly unplayable. Controls freezing like hell and it looks more like punishment for buying it not game and fun. Because of graphics level it completely impossible to see pale red clouds of monsters and even worse with those invisible mothefu...monsters.
I regret for wasting my money on this. It's got two patches already and they weight is half of game each and after those there no improvment of game quality at all. Programmers weren't even trying do something worth, they just downgraded and cut of all stuff that vita have no power to vield.
It's not optimised, bad looking, hard to control and it's my worst vita experience of all time. Don't even think to buy it.
Ps and i'm not talking about gamedesign where you must replay all levels for two times 'cause developers are lazy bastards and they don't care about game itself - just profit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You'll start playing the tutorials and slowly you'll realise that you're dying with every minute. You'll finish the field for tutorial 1 after what feels like an eternity. Then you'll look at the list of tutorials and see that tutorial 10 is "plant potatoes". Oh good god this can sod the hell off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was by far the worst dlc for fallout 3. Many compare it to bethesdas first dlc Operation anchorage which was a major disappointment. But although that one was short it was a lot of fun and you came out with great equipment. Like Operation anchorage Mothership zeta is based on Fallout 3s combat. Unlike Operation anchorage mothership zeta is just plain old boring. Once completed theres no reason to replay. It gets boring real quickly. The most interesting highlight was the space walk and an interesting death ray battle. The new characters are interesting. Being able to meet a pre war soldier and a cowboy from way before the great war was amazing. Until you realize that all they have to say is I can't believe they did that to the world. The new equipment is bland. There is nothing original in the alien designs. Its different from fallout and is cool to look at for a shortwhile. Buts its like any old alien movie, little green guys speaking in jibberish with bug eyes. This is the worst dlc of all five. The fact that this is the last is the worst way bethesda can leave us. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This DLC sends one of my favorite games out on a bad note. Linear pacing, almost no Karma alteration (killing the unarmed xenocidal maniacs in the ship nets negative karma, and that's about it), and an almost complete lack of story put it on par with Operation: Anchorage. Unlike O:A, though, there's no game-altering loot like the Stealth Armor or Winterized T-51b Power Armor. Sure, there's a bunch of nice energy weapons, but none of them markedly better than what exists in the core game. In the end, I find myself hoarding the Alien Epoxy found on the ship (which can repair any weapon on its own) and ignoring the rest of the DLC. After completion, one has the option of returning to the mothership; I find myself wondering why to go there in the first place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Godfather 3 of DLCs. Doesn't make much sense and doesn't advance the Fallout narrative whatsoever.
I'm playing it through this second time now purely for the achievements.
Play it once if you're a completionist, but never again.
The worst of what the Fallout series has to offer.
Playable, though just barely, and easily forgettable.

Released on April 5th, Vroom in the night sky was a nice little surprise for me. Cute anime hunnies, motorcycles and the worst Japanese translation ever….period! I thought that it’d be a really great game….and it sure was………. A game….  The whole point of the game is to ride your magical motorcycle, or chair through the NIGHT SKY and collect the floating star medals. Collecting all of the medals on the map will unlock the portal….but the only point of the portal is to take you back to the main menu. Along with collecting the EVER SO IMPORTANT STAR MEDALS you can collect stardusts….or whatever the **** they’re called. These magical space monies will let you unlock much faster motorcycles. That’s pretty much the whole game. Yep, just collecting the useless stardusts to extend your arsenal of space machines and unlock copy and paste maps. Although the game itself comes short in about every aspect. Plot…..Characters…….Dialogue…. There are a collection of tutorials that teach you how to play the game. You wanna know how to drift? There's a tutorial for that! You wanna know how to bounce off of the ground like a trampoline? There’s a mother****ing tutorial for that! I think that the best thing about the tutorials is that they teach you how to play a game that isn’t even worth playing! Not that there is anything to play…
Overall, I give this game 2 choking joey’s world tours out of 10. I think that it has the potential to be a really fun indie, but I don’t think that the devs really thought about making a game…...It’s pretty much a cute game with the added hd rumble feature. Oh and you can set the rumble feature to VIOLENT and stick it up your ASS! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In all honesty this was clearly rushed and is a very disappointing indie game, graphics were awful I mean it looks dreadful and is definitely the worst game on the Nintendo Switch so far, I have no idea why Nintendo accepted this game to be on the eShop totally not worth it maybe Nintendo was really in the need of the games and they still are.

Otherwise gameplay is just not up to standard as it should be this is a game you should avoid so please don't waste your money on this title. "Vroom in the night sky is a magical bike action game." Well from my experience it wasn't really magical but those are Nintendo's words. Just don't buy it, simple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shallow, bland, borderline broken. Even for free, the time it takes to play it is a price too high. There are some easier achievements to pick up, and then it's time to move on. To its credit, online multiplayer actually works well, not that it'd be nice to drag someone else into this game. Ugly, unambitious, boring, and frustrating. There's a reason you can't download it anymore. It's a shameful, awful game. Easy review. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Free. It better be free. This game is garbage. If I don't get dropped off of EVERY single multiplayer match I have ever had before the race has even started then I'm trying the poor single player. I know it's free, but if someone was giving you free puke would you want it? Barely warrants a download, out of curiosity or 200 painfully boring achievement points. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is quite terrible. Its crap through and through. Pretty much everything is executed poorly. The driving, the shooting, all bad. It is also crazy hard, and unforgiving. Ohh yeah, its ugly as well. The good: It's free. It has achievements. The bad: Everything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is game is Insanely over-rated. I'm the kind of person that rates every game on how it stacks up today, not how it was in the past. Older games can be amazing, I go back and play Megaman and the original zelda and love them, but this game is pretty terrible, having to wait for your enemy to attack just to fight and having one of the most boring and terrible lacking over-worlds ever doesn't help. Not to mention the camera is horrid. IF you want a more detailed review I suggest Egoraptor's video on the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love legend of zelda, but this game almost killed it for me. First of all, NAVI IS SO ANNOYING, this fairy always says stupid things and states the obvious 100% of the time. Second, the intro to this game was horrendous, and the entire first act was annoying. Third, the over world and transportation was annoying. Fourth, the locking system was terrible.

The second act was good, but the first act was so terrible that it ruined the entire experience for me. I don't understand how anyone thinks this game is a masterpiece. The only thing that is good about this game is the story. The overall experience is frustrating at times and some of the bosses are bad as well. I will definitely will NOT recommend this game to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One word: Boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I only give this a two because it's fun to watch other people fight the final boss. Couldn't hold my interest for any amount of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pointless game, i'd rather count my fingers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am gonna be honest. i thought this game was TERRIBLE. I remember when i first bought it i was like hey look the zelda game people were so wow about. MOM GET ME THIS. she got me it then. the cutscene was ok but i took me a hour to get 30 rupees for a shield. i went to the tree and i tried to set the thing on fire but it was litterally impossible. it also has a game breaking glitch where you could finish the game in 10 mins. anyway i did play through it some more. i liked some of the stuff but i just rage quitted at the water temple. i betcha this game hadnt got a water temple it would have got 100% people saying "Best Game EVER" and stuff like that. now te super mario 64 was revolutionary and one of the best games ever made for it. so was goldeneye. but i still cant forgive nintendo for the disaster of this game. rather play ride to hell retribution 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is just....bad!! It is so buggy,so poorly executed and it make me vomit.If you are going to buy this game,do it if you are either fan of the previous games or just a big Tony Hawk fan.If you are not, do not buy the game and if you do, you will see what I'm talking about 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Over hyped. A plain game pagued with framerate issues and bad gore effects. Ohh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+first few missions are fun +its fun to drive, even with the horrible vehiclecontrol -Horrible Vehiclecontrol -Horrible Shootingmechanics -Bad graphics, even for 2008 -Boring Story -Only Hacker/Cheater in Multiplayer -Multiplayer is very bad designed. You need like 10 minutes to get in a game -Bad Police/Crimesystem: Police will come after you, even if they never saw you doing the crime
-No other environment than the City.

2/10

Sorry, but 98 is just ridicolous. Im a huge GTA fan, but this GTA is not good in my opinion 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a good game, but the media reviews are totally over blown, it has plenty of flaws, and the aiming mechanics are sloppy. Funnier still is how everyone points this out yet still gives it a perfect score, it's pathetic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm surprised of how people think of this game. Such a piece of trash. The worst in game driving I've ever played. If it was a game that driving is just a tiny part of it, that would be kinda forgivable. But driving in this game is a big part. The most stupid AI for this gen system I've ever seen. I run the red light in front of a cop and nothing happens. But if I park on a side walk the cop will run out and start shooting at me. other drivers drive like they should not pass the driving test at the DMV. Some story line makes no sense at all, people don't forget how to speak their language for living in the US for only 10 years. In fact it's impossible to forget their native language when they still have an accent that strong speaking English. I wish this game was XboX exclusive really, coz this game really fit with their exclusive trash collections. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here is a summary for those who don’t want to read the whole review (the review contains spoilers).
+Very Strong Opening
+ (At the time it was released) Good Graphics, but that is not worth shouting about as graphics quickly become out of date.
+Mini games (e.g. bowling) are well pulled off.
-Very repetitive missions, with next to no variety making the game boring, as you go to a location kill someone/or collect something, 50 times.
-Virtually no customisation, which makes your character feel no different from start to finish, reducing the level of fun.
-Very annoying aspects like terrible driving.
-Boring combat
-Very average story, with limited variety.

In short buy Saints Row 2, Sleeping Dogs or even Gta San Andreas, these games are far superior, and are more fun. Gta 4 is worth a rental at most.

Full Review
The start of the game is very strong, as you become immersed in wanting to find out about Niko Bellic and how he struggles to find the “American Dream”. The graphics (at the time it was released) were of good quality, giving the game the look of a next generation grand theft auto game.

However you quickly realise that the game falls flat on nearly every level.

One of the annoyances of the game you will notice very quickly is the driving, which while fun at first, proves to be a dump on your front door step. This is because all vehicles feel very similar and under steer like  or if you apply too much throttle over steer like they were on ice. The use of toll gates and crashing every five seconds resulting in you falling out the windscreen, only serve as the bits of sweet corn in the dump on your door step. Such a terrible driving system, further serves as a reminder of how much Rockstar have removed from San Andreas, because the driving in that was insane and FUN.

Another annoyance is how there is nothing to spend your money making it pointless. Unlike in previous games where you could buy property and businesses making you feel like a bad ass overlord, in Gta 4, you can buy clothes, a few guns (less than you could get in Gta San Andreas) and food. This is something you will notice as it adds to the lack of depth in Niko, as his primary motive is money, yet he can’t spend it on anything so what is the point, in him risking his arse every 5 seconds.

Another of the many annoyances is the character interaction. Your uncle (Roman) is one the most annoying characters in gaming history, constantly being a little  Jacob is a walking, talking serotype as is Packie, (and his whole family). However the worst character (unfortunately) is the one you play as (Niko). He is basically a black stale, and while Rockstar tried to add depth to his character by revealing his story of being a former army solider gradually, ultimately it amounts to nothing of interest, demonstrating a lack of depth to his character.

With regards to the story, there is nothing ground breaking here, as it is your standard revenge story, nothing as gripping as Sleeping Dogs which was predictable was still enjoyable. The only really noticeable moment of the story is the choice at the end (Spoiler alert) where you get to choice if Roman dies or Kate dies by undergoing one of two missions prior to the event. However it falls flat, as you want to kill off Roman, but if you do Kate disappeared, making it better to keep the annoying prick (Roman) alive over the only decent character in the story (Kate). Furthermore the choice has no impact on the actually ending, making it rather pointless. I can see where they were going, trying to make it a dark and quite depressing story, but honestly with all the annoyances of Niko, I couldn’t care less about what happens to him. This ultimately means that the story, like the game on the whole, falls flat.

However possible the main problem with the game is how there is NO variety in anything. This can be seen by how in the following areas GTA 4, has limited variety, Missions (in Gta4 you virtual go from location to location killing people, with minimal challenge as the Enemy A.I have a tendency to just peek out of cover exposing their heads making for easy head shots or suicide charge; and no build up. In San Andreas there while Enemy A.I is retarded the variety of missions make up for it), Customisation (in San Andreas and Saints Row 2 you could get tattoos, haircuts, and tons of clothes; in Gta4 you can only buy a limited number of clothes), Vehicles (in San Andreas and Saints Row 2 you had tons of vehicles and planes, in Gta4 there is only like 3 helis and no planes).  This lack of variety makes it so it feels that Rockstar removed all of what made San Andreas so great, and replaced it with mediocrity dullness.

All these mind-numbing elements ultimately make the game annoying without enough irritations to make you turn it off. This, from a studio that gave us games like Max Payne 3, Bully etc., amounts to a great disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am an avid gamer, 37K gamerscore.... But I can't roll with a game that revolves around cop killing and prostitution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I actually liked the driving. It's cool how the old junk cars (i.e. Roman's Taxi) can't handle worth a damn and the wheels lock up when you brake traveling at high speeds and the fancier cars (i.e. Coquette, Comet, Infernus) handle like a dream and seem to have ABS. I also liked how varied the buildings are. If you take the time to look at them there aren't very many that are identical, and little things like graffiti add to the atmosphere. But where is the comedy? Where are the properties? With such a massive variety of buildings, why can't I enter the vast majority of them? Where is the sprawling landscape? Where is the national guard? Where is the mission variety (you can either "drive here" or "drive here and kill this guy" or MAYBE "follow this guy then kill him and his friends")? Why are there clothes stores from San Andreas that I'm not allowed to enter? Why do these stores have online shops I can't buy things from? Why don't I get unlimited ammo after I beat the game (I mean, 8 rockets, seriously)? What's with the ending? Did I put up with all that monotony just to lose? Why can't I take over Pegorino's house after he dies, with the two garages and and a house with a helipad right around the corner? Why do I have to spend time taking my 6 friends to one of 7 or 8 generic tasks just so they'll like me enough to help me out (if Rockstar was shooting for realism, saving Roman's ass probably would have been enough reason for him to give you free taxis, same with Little Jacob for the cheap guns)? In San Andreas, there were 3 unique cities with a massive country landscape to fly over/drive through in between. In GTA 3 and Vice City, you were confined to a city but the atmosphere was so light and fun that you felt like you could do anything. GTA 4 restricts you to three identical-feeling islands, covered in high-rises and skyscrapers, and once you get over how fun the ragdoll effect of running over people is, you begin to feel absolutely limited to what you can do. I waited the entire game to get an option of something to do other than the safehouse, a date, or a mission. I never got it. If you've never played a GTA game before this title will absolutely blow your mind, but anyone who has played either third-person game in the franchise will be left feeling ripped off and disappointed due to the complete lack of new features (or even old features for that matter). Long story short: if you have a backwards compatible ps3, get the GTA trilogy. If you don't, get a used ps2 and get the GTA trilogy. Each title in this set offers hundreds more hours of enjoyment than GTA 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are you guys kidding me saying this is one of the best games ever for one the game is wayyyyy too dark and yes i have adjusted the settings I do not understand why everyone wants open world all the time yes i enjoy some open world games but this one blew i enjoyed saints row and dead island a thousand times more 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't find this entertaining and fun. I don't mind the ability to steal cars and stuff but I don't know why it got 98/100 that is just ridiculous.  But a game to keep in mind is....................WATCH DOGS!!! you can steal cars and hack and control literally anything! The game isn't out yet but it is definantly going to be better than this! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overhyped junk.
You see:
Plot is dull and vague
Missions are repetetive and unoriginal.
Downfall of R* started here, with this lousy game.

graphx is good, so youngsters maybe be pleased, but that's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a useless piece of crap...was enjoyable for about 5missions! you can't by properties, vehicles are fairly limited over all and they mostly feel like you're driving the same thing.Graphics were crap.Sounds were crap. San Andreas was way better. Dont know why the critics thought it was so awesome.something tells me i won't be believing the "critics" anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Online on PS3? Nope...haven't been able to get online since the release and my game keeps crashing. Why do PS3 games always screw up when they are first released. I am so annoyed i want to trade this thing in for a 360 or wii... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a bad game. I was bored after 3 hours of playing it. The storytelling is meh, and you're basically driving for the majority of the time, and you don't even get a gun for a LONG time! And on top of that, you have to buy or find your health. I died countless times from forgeting that you had to find a hotdog vendor to survive. A sentence of advice, don't buy this game. Games are meant for amusement, but there was no fun in this "game". Buy Saint's Row, it has humor, wit, and you don't have to wait 5 hours to get a gun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Way overhyped! Not down with cop killing and prostitution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Something is REALLY fishy with all the extremely positive reviews of this game.I have played all the previous games of the series and i have to say this is the most boring and overrated game of the series. I've played all the previous games and i thought they were pretty good games. After 2 hours of playing i was already bored. I tried to give this game a chance and played for another 10 hours. Then i couldn't take it anymore. The story is not interesting, the characters are not interesting and many of the previous games gameplay elements have been removed. Even if all the above are just my opinion this game definitely does not deserve 10/10 so many reviewers gave it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most overrated game of all time! this game sucks so bad. I only paid 20 bucks for it and I feel like I have been ripped off. San Andreas is way better this game is so bad it shouldn't be allowed to have the GTA name.  I would recommend Saints row 3 if you like the past GTA's. Rockstar should be ashamed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hell are the critics thinking?!? This game is just terrible in comparison to San Andreas. The 2 is only for the graphics. The missions suck. The gameplay sucks. This game sucks. Hopefully the series will improve, otherwise GTA will sink as a franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had some fun playing it but its just not the same as the other ones,it doesnt feel like a GTA game.trust me im no GTA hater i loved san andreas and vice city but this one never really made me like have to beat it...hopefully the next one will be better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WAY overrated. I... I just don't understand the praise this got from the critics. And im ashamed at the industry for placing this with legends like OOT. Hours were wasted going from place to place, killing drug dealers and stealing cars got repetitive and rather menial. The critics said that the morally aware gamer would love this... no. The more I played, the more I saw my character for the scumbag he was. and as someone who sees myself as the charcter I am playing, I felt Ill. I am giving it two points more then I want, but you have to give it credit for improvement over the other GTA games, which I was never able to spend more then half an hour on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have always been a fan of the GTA series, from back in the day when I played on PC with the birds eye view.  This was a classic series that was so revolutionary during the times of GTAIII and Vice City.  Needless to say, my expectations for this game were very high!One thing I really noticed when played this game is that Rockstar have really gone for a grand storyline- and in turn the gameplay has suffered.  The best thing about GTA was the over the top fun you could have, running riot in a city as a criminal figure.  This city to me, whilst expansive and scenic, just seemed so bland and lifeless at the same time.  There was just not much to do compared to other GTA games, and I felt myself just wanting to get through the missions as soon as I could.  In the past, i would have spent countless hours just running pedestrians over for fun, doing the little fun side missions (which seemed lacklustre this time), buying property, starting fights with rival gangs (ala GTAIIi) and just being a general pest in the world Rockstar had created for me.  This time- I felt no compulsion or need to do these things, and i put this down to the world just feeling too realistic.  Bring back the gangs so i can go shoot up their hood!Video games are supposed to be fun Rockstar- go back to your roots!Anyway, many people will enjoy this game but it may be a game you hire instead, or wait until it hits the bargain bins.  My personal opinion is that this game is the first GTA that i would not recommend buying! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is redundant in the worst way. It's just a repeat of previous versions. It's incredibly repetitive and I completely lost interest 3 hours into the game. Absolutely doesn't deserve your money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is dreadfull, the storyline is boring and repetitive, cars still look worse than vice city, acting is ok, multiplayer is a good addition but isnt layed out anywhere near well enough, graphics look a year out of date and the whole customisation area that was brought up in san andreas goes out the window!! I dindnt w8 since san andreas for rockstar do come up with this. giving it a 2 is generous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was pretty disappointed with this game. Graphics are very nice, although the filter washes everything out to where I can't really appreciate them. Music was subpar compared to previous titles although that could be my disdain for modern music, but they should have at least had an oldies station. The new driving system didn't really bother me with it's added realistic physics, it did require a greater degree of skill than previous titles but I found I was able to get it down after a while. The gun play was awkward with an inability to manually target enemies well, although I did like the cover system. I guess the bulk of my disappointment was with the story, which I found lackluster, and the actual "fun" of the game. Realism is something I don't want to see in GTA games, they have always been "arcadey" and campy. To take out all the fun little details that have made past games so engaging is the height of stupidity as I see it. I bought this game right after it came out and I got to the end of the game and lost my desire to even finish it, it sits on my shelf collecting dust. I give this game -200 pigeons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its a good game overall, gorgeous and fast cars, funny at times but one of the biggest cheats i've ever encountered when it comes to missions. very dissapointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Galaxy uses play mechanics from a 10 year old game and graphics from a 5 year old game, and doesn't even have a great storyline to salvage it from the depths of un-originality. It was nice, but won't be deserving of any Game of the Year awards, even if it wins them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring gameplay, abysmal story, , unnecessary prophecies and gimmicks, oh, and Mario fans are going to attack people that don't like the new Mario games? This game has it all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is getting boring now. Can't nintendo think of anything else or do they still have to rely on kids buying games with characters that have been used hundreds of times before. Once again Mario returns to yet another pointless and easy mission to save the princess who has been captured (again) just like he has for all the other hundreds of games. The only people who can find this game/series fun anymore are children (really really young children), people who just like walking on planets that take 10 steps to go around and catch a star while killing one enemy or brain dead people (which is actually a bit like the second one). If you want to waste your money on something repetitive then by all means get this but if you still like mario and really want to play it then play an older one (it is the same game basically). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

By far, this is one of the worst game ever made. I felt sorry for them. But this game is unacceptable and it's a really bad situated game. The graphics are well done, but the game play? Declined. I hate games like this, it has no feel into it. It just makes you feel even stranger when you're playing this. I understand the story line and all that. But, please. It needs improvements. These games will not be accepted in any gaming market. Even if you make profit, your loss is even bigger. I'm sorry, but I declined this project. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ride to Hell: Retribution is... its awful. The graphics are decent but the sound effects are horrible. The storyline is weak and the characters arent well written. The gameplay is not good at all. But there exists some customisation and as I mentioned before, the graphics are decent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sometimes games like this have to exist. They are a great reminded of how bad a game can get. The game is extremely buggy, you will be falling through the map, watching npc fly away into the sky, which makes the game unplayable. Then you have the terrible dialogue, so bad that's its laughable. I suggest no one to ever play this game, but if you do best of luck to you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not the worst game I have ever tried to play, but it is not far from it. The review on Destructoid pretty much points out every detail I would, and in much the same way.

It's cheap, the art is 6 years dated, the game play might have been passable 10 years ago, it plays like a BAD console port and the the cuts from scene to scene or between scenes and cinematics are horribly disjointed and it's helpful tips on how to play tend to be anything but, and often flat out wrong advice, like when it tells you to hit Shift to accelerate when it's actually currently done with your space bar.

This thing plays like a bunch of free to play mini-games tied together and shoved into the laziest plotline I think I've ever been exposed to. It is not fun, not inspired, not aesthetically pleasing and if you are not a chauvinistic pig, it may be downright offensive.

Do not buy this game, for any price.. You will never be able to get back the time you waste trying to play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shallow, bland, borderline broken. Even for free, the time it takes to play it is a price too high. There are some easier achievements to pick up, and then it's time to move on. To its credit, online multiplayer actually works well, not that it'd be nice to drag someone else into this game. Ugly, unambitious, boring, and frustrating. There's a reason you can't download it anymore. It's a shameful, awful game. Easy review. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Free. It better be free. This game is garbage. If I don't get dropped off of EVERY single multiplayer match I have ever had before the race has even started then I'm trying the poor single player. I know it's free, but if someone was giving you free puke would you want it? Barely warrants a download, out of curiosity or 200 painfully boring achievement points. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is quite terrible. Its crap through and through. Pretty much everything is executed poorly. The driving, the shooting, all bad. It is also crazy hard, and unforgiving. Ohh yeah, its ugly as well. The good: It's free. It has achievements. The bad: Everything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Released on April 5th, Vroom in the night sky was a nice little surprise for me. Cute anime hunnies, motorcycles and the worst Japanese translation ever….period! I thought that it’d be a really great game….and it sure was………. A game….  The whole point of the game is to ride your magical motorcycle, or chair through the NIGHT SKY and collect the floating star medals. Collecting all of the medals on the map will unlock the portal….but the only point of the portal is to take you back to the main menu. Along with collecting the EVER SO IMPORTANT STAR MEDALS you can collect stardusts….or whatever the **** they’re called. These magical space monies will let you unlock much faster motorcycles. That’s pretty much the whole game. Yep, just collecting the useless stardusts to extend your arsenal of space machines and unlock copy and paste maps. Although the game itself comes short in about every aspect. Plot…..Characters…….Dialogue…. There are a collection of tutorials that teach you how to play the game. You wanna know how to drift? There's a tutorial for that! You wanna know how to bounce off of the ground like a trampoline? There’s a mother****ing tutorial for that! I think that the best thing about the tutorials is that they teach you how to play a game that isn’t even worth playing! Not that there is anything to play…
Overall, I give this game 2 choking joey’s world tours out of 10. I think that it has the potential to be a really fun indie, but I don’t think that the devs really thought about making a game…...It’s pretty much a cute game with the added hd rumble feature. Oh and you can set the rumble feature to VIOLENT and stick it up your ASS! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In all honesty this was clearly rushed and is a very disappointing indie game, graphics were awful I mean it looks dreadful and is definitely the worst game on the Nintendo Switch so far, I have no idea why Nintendo accepted this game to be on the eShop totally not worth it maybe Nintendo was really in the need of the games and they still are.

Otherwise gameplay is just not up to standard as it should be this is a game you should avoid so please don't waste your money on this title. "Vroom in the night sky is a magical bike action game." Well from my experience it wasn't really magical but those are Nintendo's words. Just don't buy it, simple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoyed Double Dragon: Neon in any capacity what so ever, then turn and run as far from this title as possible. Everything about is broken, from the clunky controls that make you feel as if your input is traveling to the moon and back before registering on your console, to the music that will make your ears bleed. Honestly, I've heard more inspired tunes from my niece on her Casio. I haven't been this irate, disappointed, and just blatantly confused regarding a down loadable game since "Amy". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nyxx said it best in their review. Honestly, this feels like a old game you'd play on a mobile device with how clunky the responses are. I don't quite understand why the entire screen shakes with every hit connected but it takes away from what little is to be enjoyed here. By all means, DO NOT attempt to grab a weapon. you crouch down for what feels like 1.5 seconds, leaving you open to attack. This game is exactly why the brawler genre died out last generation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We were promised a '60's paradise in this game,but all we got is a lot of  Quick Time Events.
I can't say anything good about it.
Let's take a look at the graphics,they suck,textures are so bad.
Let's take a look at the gameplay,too darn repetitive.
This game is kinda saved from 1/10 thanks to it's idea.
All in all,this game gets an 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of those sh*tty arcade games from the 80's that you can't help but play because it's so hilariously bad. It may not be worth playing, but watch gameplay on youtube if you want to laugh your ass off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is godawful, But brings anew list of idea's that people will  on, But the game could of've been awesome. At least the best part about the game is the soundtrack itself!
Though I mainly enjoy this game for it's Humor glitch's and bugs.
These game is 9/10 if your looking for a humorous time, In other words; I give it a 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game I was expecting for 4 years. I saw first concept arts at 2009, and thought  that is Full Throttle 2 I was waiting for!
And finally it released.. Well,  background of the game is till cool, but graphics, gameplay, and scenario are awful. The 3D models and skeletons of people in game are primitive, textures are low, you can't even read a colors on their jackets!
Gameplay is screwed, it looks like a bad port from a PS2 with all possible bugs.
And scenario is so weak I can't even speak about it.
This game is a real digital trash. I really regret money and time I spent for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the abomination of the 7th generation of consoles. All of the story is confusing, the controls are disgusting and the bike riding is broken. For example, you randomly fly off to the right and explode and it took few hours to complete... Despite the glitches and everything I got a few good laughs out of it and its not the worst idea of a game. Its just Deep Silver took a huge crap on the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its the best game ever in the history of the world. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A pale shell of the franchise. The A.I. is bad, no voice acting, a wire frame of a storyline, and long loading times for sub par graphics. A great survival horror game turned into a lesser than average co-op shooter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Since this game is already buried under a mountain of terrible, i'm just going to say that the only thing it gets right is me crying alone in a dark room. That's the only positive thing about it.

So to be fair I'll give it a 0.5 for giving me a real life experience, another 0.5 for being in a dark environment in game and a 1 for the sorry guys who made the effort of producing this misleading 'thing'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The title's design is too flawed to recommend it for purchase, so make a deal with yourself and avoid buying this game. Deal or No Deal is simply one of the most dull and short-lived videogames of all time, barely fit for mobile phones let alone the mighty DS. Deal or No Deal: That is the question. No Deal: That is the answer. This game shouldn't have been thought of. The concept doesn't even help: it's about a game show where you pick briefcases with low numbers, no skill at all, it's just luck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Deal or no Deal is a sad enough tv show to watch. As a game, it's abysmal. People look like cardboard cutouts, and sound is awful and samey. But you haven't even scraped the surface with that. See, if you enjoy picking numbers out of boxes, Deal or no Deal is for you. Anyone with half a brain could make a deal or no deal game without electronics. There's also a board game out of deal or no deal. Its existence on consoles is absolutely pointless. In addition to the main game, there are other modes barely worth mentioning. They're supposed to be extras, but in realoty the best extra would be for this game to burn. If someone tries to sell this to you, whatever the price, even if it's free, say no deal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Once you get the hang of the game, it becomes quite entertaining.  You get to kill many people first person shooter style and you have all the same kind of experiences you would playing BF3 or COD.  However,  the game is riddled with bugs and unavailable features.  The developers are probably going to look at their score and immediately think.. "DAYZ FANBOYS ATTACKED" or somethign along that line like they have done before...  But seriously, look into your soul and quit being so damn shady.  There are so many sarcastic things they do in response to the criticism they receive (which they absolutely deserve).  For instance, the build was changed 12/18/12 to v.0.9.9 to avoid it being called what it was before: v.1.0.0.   They also have these terrible surveys, and they pull percentages from who knows where.  This is besides the matter of the game, but one of the BIGGEST reasons why you shouldn't buy it.  "well it's only $15, you are ******* cheap" $15 times hundreds of thousands of sales = big money.  It needs to be earned legit 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought (yes, I like everyone else, paid money for this game) War Z due to the promise of a released MMO in a post-apocalyptic world with zombie invasion, what I got was a joke:
- Alpha status (ground structure is there, but thats it) - It IS Alpha/Technical Demo, other companies/indies use this state of the game to go to Kickstarter, 2 years later a proper product would be released with features that work!
- No real MMO (sorry guys, 50/100 is NOT massive - having hundreds of shards of 50-100 is also not massive)
- Many basic functionalities not yet implemented (tutorial, skill system, quests, swimming, fighting with fists/feet, anything to keep the player there)
- Already has a real-cash market? Wow...just wow...alpha status and already making it pay2play/win...go to kickstarter and get your sponsors there!
- No advanced functionalities (vehicles, clans)
- Clipping in terrain (didnt you just cleanup the terrain? lol)
- After 10 deaths, no more starter gear? Gee...since I cant fight with my bare hands, its all a matter of luck to find a weapon vs. zombies and hopefully im lucky not be killed by another player with a flashlight!
- Sandbox? lol...time to have a look at what a real sandbox means guys. In a sandbox environment, I would rip a branch off a tree, sharpen it with a few stones and then i would have a very crude weapon (better than nothing). I could find nails and make my own nailbat, I could find string/vines and add a rock to my spear to make a hammer, rip out the damn barstools in the resturant and use that as a damn weapon!
- Loads of houses, but only a small fraction can be entered? Lazy or maybe just ALPHA and unfinished?
- Decorations? So you can go into houses...but why is almost every house/building empty? Sure, people used it but debris should still be a minimum to create a proper atmosphere.
- FALL DAMAGE after 1m? *cry*
- 4h respawn timer? I think i dont need to comment this, do I?
- Griefers - *sigh* how I hate loosing everything, but I guess thats survival and **** happens"
- Armour helps jack at the moment

Lets look directly at your website:
"New generation MMO" - Uhm, no its not, its still a normal game with a payshop...
"AAA Graphics" - nope, with all that clipping and horrible textures...
"Huge persistant world" - yup, no lie here, it is really huge and takes very VERY long to run anywhere (semi-boring guys)
"Create your own survival experience by selecting one of the available characters, customizing them and helping them" - Um, I can only select 1 character, "customization" = a few heads and clothes?
"Gain experience and spend it to learn dozens of available skills in this Zombie Game" - Dozens of available skills? reaalllly? where?

So basically, 4 out of 5 things are a lie. I bought the game in hopes of a real sandbox in zombie fashion, with neat "skills"/attributes that increase while I play (run longer and faster would be a nice start)

What has been done right(ish)?
- Zombie AI/Sneaking works not too bad once you get used to it. It IS possible to sneak around the zombies if you know how.
- No lag on the servers, well done on this
- Global Inventory - good idea. even if its seriously irritating having to run 20-30min to a safe spot and then log out, it does work. Pity it doesnt work at the post offices as mentioned on the survivor screen
- Day/Night cycle - I actually love this, even if I dont have a flashlight anymore due to dying too many times, but still, this works wonders for atmosphere and night time can be seriously scary

Seriously, this IS a Alpha/very early Beta (I have been playing alphas/betas for over 15 years now). Please mention this on your website and stop making people pay for this at the moment. I can see the game has potential, but dont lie to your PAYING customers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game WAS aswome crazy at alpha and bigining of beta. I bought it first week of allpha launch and clearly enjoyed. From this date to yesterday, I passed almost all my free time on it.... but at steam release time, Hammerpoint totally broke it bad. Let me explain... One point is that you own 5 charactere slots, and you have to know that when one of your char die ingame, it lose all ths stuff he was carrying and was unable to revive for 1 hour. At steam relaase, hammerpoint passed this revival time from 1 hour to 4 hours, with the possibility to instant revive with a real money cost option. That means the poeple you are killing can instant repop, close to your position, and with a full stuff dropped at revive from general inventory. On the other hand, if YOU die, and if you want, for example, continue to play with a group of friend you were playing with, hammerpoint force you to spend real cash to. What seems like some betrayal cause Hammerpoint promised that The WarZ would be a game you buy and you wouldn t have to pay additive cost to play... Of course, there is a marketplace, but mostly for cosmmetics item (recently, all scopes switched to ingame cash to real cash, which isn t very fair, same problem). My conclusion ?? The War Z is globally  an awsome entertainment, but the recent change of way from Hammerpoint just turned it into a Pay to Play beta game. Let's hope it would change in near future, but for the moment, I can"t rate it good because of it. (my appologise for my bad english, but I think every feeling about this soft have to be say cause it s a real good beta game with a real potential for entertainment, but those recent changements totally deserve it) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful, simply awful. the only thing worse than the fact that they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING is the online community. If this is the future of MMOs then I'm ready to get off the train. What do you expect from the developer that brought you the proclaimed worst game of all times, Big Riggs. This game is a worthy followup. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
Really really bad. I tried it out while it was in "alpha/beta". I saw great potential in it but as they were getting closer and closer to the release date I basically saw devs that didn't really care about the game but more or less the money they could make from hopping on the DayZ bandwagon. Now that the "foundation build" is out nothing has changed.The map is still buggy, the textures are horrible, and most importantly almost all of their promises were never met (cars, strongholds, etc). If the game has been in development for as long as they claim it's been I expected more and I'm basically extremely disappointed.

Again this game HAD potential but this game jsut blows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadful. Not being a player of DayZ, but aware that my friends and others had enjoyed it, I quickly saw this game (The War Z) and made the connection that it was the stand alone DayZ that I had previously heard rumors of. Now, I'm willing to accept that I'm at a lot of fault for buying this game on impulse without doing any research, and I quickly found out after I had bought the game, but before I had played it, that it was not any actual version of DayZ, but rather an imitation, I was a bit concerned. Still, I tried it out with some optimism; it couldn't be terrible, but how wrong I was. The game is far from complete. Now, this in itself is no real crime; plenty of games are played before they are complete yet they evolve into something much greater over time. The real tragedy here is that it makes no mention of it's Alpha stage before you purchase it. It, indeed, presents itself as a full and complete game. Now, even then, that's not to say the game couldn't be fun. Yet, while some tend to enjoy it, it would seem a good majority does not. (including myself) There's nothing that really orients you towards any sort of goal. Now, this is also sometimes a good thing, hell, it worked for Minecraft, but in this case there isn't really too much to actually grasp and adapt to in the game. Focus in the game is not born through the mere playing of it, in my experience. Survival quickly becomes a chore, rather than a game. On the flip side, things look pretty from a distance and zombies in the game do scare the hell out of me, so the game isn't totally lacking in potential. Just, you know, as is, don't touch it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After giving this game the benefit of the doubt, after accepting and being aware of the fact that it is Alpha/beta test, and that I've only pre-ordered the game whilst being "allowed to test".. The recent alienation by the developers is one step too far (4-hour character respawn time).  This game does have potential, but more and more it seems that it's becoming "pay to win". I for one will not spend one more penny on this game, until such times as I am satisfied that the developers are no longer blatantly milking players for cash.  For me, this will probably be a year or more.

What a waste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game had potential and a team that seemed to care about their community. At first. Then they showed their true colors and showed they only care about their own greed. Pay to revive instead of waiting 4 hours, pay if you have a big clan and you can also pay for food! Then they rushed to release on steam under the false pretense of this being a "Foundation release". In no way, shape or form can this be classed as any release. Even the blind fan boys and fan girls call this beta. Sergey Titov, you and your community/forum moderators are slowly, no quickly destroying destroying this game by getting rid of anyone who posts suggestions that may be negative towards your game. I gave the game 2 out of 10 because it has potential to not derail itself but land back firmly on its tracks. Though with all these shambles you keep making, I believe you may have no idea how to fix this. In my opinion, this is a huge shame as I enjoyed the promises you gave us but if I am truly honest, I have lost all faith that you will deliver on half of them, let alone all.

P.S this is coming from someone who wasn't that impressed by Day Z. Before anyone claims I am a Day Z fan boy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is defined as an MMO. Despite this, it is definitely not an MMO. Massively Multiplayer pertains to a persistent world which does not exist in this game. Instead, you have servers with "batches" of 50 people you can play with.

The texture quality, especially the grass is quite awful. It is impossible to see in grass while proneing at all.

The money shop gives players huge advantages for those that use it and really punishes players that dont.

The game on STeam also says an 100km world and multiple maps, despite the fact that War Z only currently has 1 map and it is not even 100km.

The game is very much INCOMPLETE. I could go into horrible detail about how this game has missed the mark. I could understand, if this game was an Alpha. However, this is supposed to be version 1.0 and version 1.0 is a disaster. Not a good buy, dont waste your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OK hammer point has lied to the community and numerous occasion's and ban's way to many innocent people for there so called anti cheat  , witch has many flaws if its even real and doing ban's on illegal placed items is absurd.Banning people on forums for them speaking there mind on the game is also absurd.So much for treating the community  good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The War Z is DayZ with better graphics. The War Z has many features that rip off from Dayz. As stated in earlier reviews, it has many bugs/glitches. If you are willing to spend the extra $10 on ArmA 2, I would favor that over buying this game. Not only does ArmA 2 have mods like Day Z, it has mods like Wasteland Mod. You are getting a much better value with buying ArmA 2 over The War Z. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is a lie, it is a pay to play game that wouldn't even serve the people who payed with the kinds of features this game would need to pull some enjoyment out of it. Do not buy this game. The world is huge, yes, but it is mostly empty uninteresting space that you will have to tediously traverse. there is one map, there are supposed to be missions created by the players but i haven't seen anyone use this because the majority of your time and energy spent in this game will be spent avoiding other players because the game is balanced so that it is advantageous to spawn kill noobs as they leave the base and there are no protections for new players as they first venture out of the safe zone. this game is poorly balanced, poorly designed, does not include most of the features it says it will include, and would be pay to win if you could win, ever. Oh and did i mention that even off of hardcore mode you lose all of your items when you die and have to wait an hour to respawn. if that doesn't dissuade you then you and this game deserve each other. i promise you wouldn't enjoy it anyways. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to look passed the poor behavior of the developers (which I definitely regret), but the game still failed me.  I first tried playing on a server with about 70+ people.  I ran around killing zombies with my flash light while players were continuously banned.  Eventually as I was running clueless through an endless forest, I got banned.  I joined another server after that and it didn't get any better.  The zombies were very glitchy and got stuck a lot, but other than that it ran fine.  I had no lag or anything (and usually do not with my internet connection), so I'm not sure why I got banned.  Not worth the measly $4 I paid for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I myself personally think that The War Z has great potential, but sadly, in it's current hands, it has no hope.  The saddest part about it all is that you pay $14.99 for a game that stresses it includes features such as strongholds, anti cheat, and many other non-existent features.  The steam review is intentionally vague so that they don't need to take responsibility for telling you a specific value, a month ago they stressed it was "100 km of land", when in truth it's 100 km including the empty skybox.  The best part is, if you look at the help, they tell you it's not a Pay 4 Win game, but the weapons are so rare (some don't even spawn!) that it seems it is a Pay 4 Win.  They nickle and dime you, what I would expect from a pay once then play for life game, is that there is no in-game real-money shop.  Though the game has good features, it's the developers that I really dislike.  They give you their word, then the day comes, and they say "Sorry, there was a delay!", then you wait, and the same thing is said.   The second worst thing in this game, is that they promised you some limited item for buying the alpha version, but they know that hackers can just hack the random items in, and then claim they're legit alpha'ers, plus, they promised the alpha price was cheaper than the beta or gamma price, but is 25 less than 14.99?  I don't think so...  Plus, they abuse the new players and ban those that criticize their game in a way that forces them to either buy the game again or quit.  My thought for all you people out there, quit.  The third thing is that they make an in-game real-money shop, but hmm, I wonder, if they put the time and effort they did into the game that they did into the store, it would be even better than DayZ!   I give them credit for the base game engine, and I give them a thumbs-up for the survival based gameplay, but it's buggy, you can jump off of a car, [in which the car is incredibly off scale, or you are], and take no damage, but you can crawl down a small hill and take 3/5 of you're health as damage?  Plus, the doorways are a bit off scale, and the developers in game are jerks, some even encourage hacking.  If you put this all together, the game would be horrible if it got better, and with a good company governing over it, it would become an actual MMO, and way more enjoyable for the players.  I like the game, just not the creators. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not even worth writing a review on.

This game is the biggest disgrace of survival-horror based games. With tons of glitches, terrible AI and the lack of Anti Cheat within the game, just makes it a chore to play.

About 50% of in game features promised by the game are not present and it is clearly just rushed, and a piece of cash in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoy the game but i feel kinda scammed, game photos aren't in game footage. I bought the game cuz it sound like a good idea playing with friends but you can find cheaters that ruin your gameplay! Also the game will become into a Pay2Win. If this game doesn't get better it will have the worst metascore, and will have no people playing... Developers must work in the game before selling it... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aburrido juego de senderismo en tiempo real, vagaras por los campos de Colorado(se supone que iba a tener más mapas pero nunca llegaron) sin nada  más que hacer que matar zombies, no hay más misiones. La supervivencia que se vende consiste en mantener a raya 2 barras, una de sed y otra de hambre; lo cual es bastante fácil de conseguir.
Tras jugar durante un par de horas descubres que el único interés del juego consiste en coleccionar armas de fuego que es inútil usar contra los zombies.
Al final todo se reduce a un triste e injusto PVP en 3 zonas del mapa donde los chetos campan a sus anchas sin ningún tipo de control. Una pena porque con un buen equipo detrás habría sido bastante interesante 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game when it first came out to gain access to the early alpha. Since then many things... happened. I experienced that there were no remarkable changes for the better compared to what got worse or stayed the same.

+ zombie apocalypse
+ realistic thirst/hunger system

- paying for a game shouldn't include "real money items"
- forged ad pictures (still!)
- endless development without significant changes
- almost everytime fails at atmosphere and depth in gaming
- still many hackers
- frustrating loot system

And the list is ongoing. I am not sure if it even deserves 2/10 : 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good game, but **** game at the same time. This game has the potential to be a good game a lot of good items in games, good map, and like the concept. However it has more negatives the positives. poor melee animations is one, running looks weird, then we have 9/10 people hacking and the game is buggy and the community is utter crap in general 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought into the alpha of this around a few months back, videos and comments seem to show the same game I was playing back then. I was very patient back then, in spite of them doing nothing about the rampant hackers that I would constantly run into.  I was hoping that after a couple of months it would be a little more playable, and when I saw it on steam recently I was hoping that it was polished enough (I'm a hopeful idiot lol) to play. It's not.  Oh wait, i did notice highway markers on the map now, pretty cool. At least the map is pretty close to finished, not the TERRAIN, just the map SCREEN. about the only thing in the game unfortunately that looks ANY BIT different than it did months ago. The devs were initially biting off of the shooter genre then decided to totally be original, and bite off the dayz mod. no one else had done that yet, and there were tons of crappy shooters to compete with but only 1 dayz until they decided to rip it off, and make a paid + microtransaction-based product worse than a free mod. there should be a medal for that.    Achievement Unlocked: EPiC DEV FAiL 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was originally excited about this game. The DayZ mod was too graphically intense for me and this game seemed to hold the answer. What followed was a good faith effort by mass amounts of would be fans followed by HORRIBLE mismanagement of every possible step of game production. Feels like this company should stick to spamming Facebook games till it learns some important lessons about business, game mechanics, and community building. Already put my money into this game, at this point, I would not suggest anyone else follow suit. If you have already committed and would like a community to hold out hope in, contact someone in BMFZ. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

for goodness sake do not purchase this game, due to their quarrels over a lawsuit War Z has been removed from steam to prevent steam from becoming involved in this sham, the game itself is appalling and requires several fixes (more than that of Day Z mod for Arma 2) the servers are limited in size and people and have many issues attempting to connect to them from any day. the price for the game no matter WHAT OPTION you pick is a joke, if you insist on trying this game, find someone silly enough to have purchased it and use a day pass for 24hours, then you may have a faint incline of how poor this game really is. to top it off, the devs are refusing refunds to loyal customers who have stayed since its beta, due to the fact they have been fed false promises of repairs and new patches for the terrible bugs (which is illegal as i understand it) the in game cash system is also flawed, not only are you paying for an atrocious game the in game cash system offers you nothing unique such as custom gun or character skins, or something that will stay with the account forever, when you die, whatever you spend you lose (just imagine that £50 you just wasted) the only good points i can think of is that if the devs and mods listened and solved this game and improved it, it could have potential 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has potential but development is VERY slow, features that they claimed were already in the game that got us to buy it in the first place are not even in the game yet.  Now they have changed the respawn timer and are making people use RL money if they want to get back into the game before the 4 hours is up.  The thing is, that might be ok in a Free2Play game, but this is NOT a F2P game.  We have BOUGHT this game and we should be able to play the game that we bought! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Heard how bad it was going to be, but wanted to try it anyways. The game is fun with friends to just hop right in and try to find each other in a post-apocalyptic world while avoiding hordes of zombies (barely) and sly bandits, who are out there trying to take your supplies by killing you. It was fun before the 4-hour patch to just jump in, survive, die and repeat. But after the 4-hour re-spawn timer, if you delete a character (Why is there even a re-spawn timer anyways? If you die, you die.) and create a new one, you get nothing. Not even food or a flashlight. Seriously? You join a server and spawn in the middle of the damn forest with NO FLASHLIGHT?! On top of that, even to survive just to find food would be impossible without some type of defense. All I can say is, this game had a TON of potential. Probably the only reason I bought it. While it was play-able, after the 4-hour re-spawn patch/update, it's pretty much unplayable. To buy or not to buy? It was a buy game, but not anymore. I even had three of my friends get it because it was quite enjoyable in the beginning, but now we are all getting our refunds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this game and I tried to like terrible games like Sonic 06 and I just fail to. This game is so bad I can't and won't explain don't EVER play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely the best for the blind  .....
Best refunding game of the year  ......
the company must release some download content such as anti-cheat DLC (lol  .....
all of my friend love this game's name (just the name  ..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a failure at best and a scam at worst. Not remotely finished, horrible dev team (what kind of dev team plays the game using cheats against other players?), shoddy gameplay (Day Z ripoff, but somehow manages to be clunkier), very little content, and F2P style unlocks. Horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After 2 hours I asked for refund, and fortunately got my money back. This "game" is in pre-alpha stage, animations are terrible, dev's are using hacks on public http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=eOrNAKJbHpc#t=453s and calling players "faggots"  http://www.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729
Game description on steam is lying, they are turning this game into pay 2 win. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The War Z is far from finished/polished. I've had my fair share of fun but only to be ruined the next minute because of either hackers or dying from a 1 feet fall. It's buggy and not worth a single penny in my opinion. Worst release I've seen in years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't review this game.  Never played it, but somehow it shows up that I reviewed it as a zero.  So in fairness I will score it a 2, which is apparently higher than it deserves .  I don't know how to remove review scores from my list. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Infestation is a good game, but it's a copy off dayz and there are so much hackers and bugs. If this game had any differential of dayz I even recommend ... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The bottom line is this a company that is more worried about TRYING to control the flow of information about their game then attempting to make it better or listen to anyone that is not a fanboy. I as many others on their forums have had a ban placed on my forum account by their community manager kwek all cause we had some issues with the way the Devs were handling the development of the game to which we are paying customers of. I would see many posts get delete and or users banned for even stating one small thing the company did not like. I personally was banned AFTER I messaged kwek and asked him why my post about "paying for clan slots was a hidden fee" was deleted he banned me from the boards for "questioning a moderator" the ban is perm. Not to rant here but I did play the game for a long while and was made many promises by the company when I bought the game a few months back. ALL the promises they made have been not met, came up way short or were just totally different then what they stated.

I think the worst thing about this game is the fact that they are trying to release it as it is now and attempting to convince people that the game is "never really released" cause it will keep getting stuff added to it.

I am not going to say this game IS a scam but they people running the show over there at Hammerpoint ACT like they are presenting a scam to people. The way they argue with their paying customers is almost like a child on the internet that is mad cause he died in a video game. Oh wait thats right the lead producer did come on his own forums and cried calling people names cause he died in a video game. lol

Need I say more... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is crappy, it is really a huge scam dont buy it, just wait for the dayz standalone, like i am even tho i never played the actual mod if arma 2 co will be on sale i will get it just for the mod

I now firmly believe this game is an attempt to recoup some money after the failed War Inc, the developers are greedy liars who are just out to take your money.

I loved this game at one stage but now just cannot find any reason to want to play a game that I know is just going to continue to slide downhill.

They push every promised feature back months, they lie blatantly everyday about one thing or another and continue to hit players up with hidden charges when they said there would be zero charges after the initial purchase. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where can I start? Oh right yeah... Firstly, the developers produce screenshots that aren't even remotely correct (vehicles/working guns and vaccines e.t.c)...Then they lie about half of their features: huge maps? There's one map and let's face it, it's not very big. But we all know about those and I can't be bothered to go through any more. They took our money and put it to bad use. C'mon devs.

Now onto the game. Yeah, it's fun sometimes, but only when you get into a gunfight with a non-hacking enemy, which is my first complaint. Too many hackers. They don't even have anything close to an anti-hack system. They rely on screenshots and other reports. Then they don't even do anything.

Secondly, it's full of bugs. Too many bugs, then they have the right mind to call the game not alpha or beta, but "foundation release". Bugs: walking down a mountain and losing 90% of your health, jumping through a window and getting flung through the ceiling onto the roof, grass not rendering at far distances on lower graphics settings, therefore giving people with slower computers a better advantage. Also, all the random crashes, most commonly when you kill an enemy with lots of loot, it all drops at once causing a lag spike and even crashes.

Another thing is the zombies, way too overpowered for beginners, there needs to be some kind of tutorial to basically tell them how to survive. As a beginner you are sat there pounding 30 hits into a zombie with a baseball bat until they die. But if you're getting chased by a whole town of zombies then this isn't very good because you will almost certainly die.

Finally, the Sergey said the game won't be pay to win, but some websites are offering a version with an AKM, B92, a backpack and 21,000 GC (ingame cash). Won't be long before there's guns in the shop.

I think the game has potential but right now it's full of bugs, lying developers and constantly broken servers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably would have rated this a little bit higher as I have had fun playing it, however:

- Hackers are a massive problem, nothing has been done about it, other than implementing one of the stupidest things ever - loot bait. Placing items inside of walls which only people using ESP would know about. This led to a lot of legitimate player accounts being banned. There's a so-called anti-cheat system which analyses player patterns - this isn't good enough. I might as well go and buy some hacks now, I'll never get caught.

- Each patch seems to fix 5 bugs, and introduce 10 more. Patch release dates as well as promised features are constantly late, or not implemented at all. Other patches introduce things which are blatant money making schemes. Changing revive times to 4 hours, but then adding an option to PAY to revive instantly for example, right on top of Christmas, when they know more people will be playing, and have money to spend - despite the fact that you're probably going to die to hackers more often than not.

- Lying about features in the game - and then blaming customers for 'misinterpreting' information - the information could only be interpreted one way - it's a blatant case of false advertising (STEAM removed it from sale the same day it was launched on there. Also, check out the article on Forbes and GameSpy for more info.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave this game a 2/10 because its not really that great.  I got the game as a gift on steam and I decided to give it a go.  Wasn't that great to start off with, lag spikes and frame rate drops near citys or towns.  Which btw can get you killed (been there done that).  Graphics are "ok", but game play needs to be better.  Starting off in the middle of nowhere is not really all that fun, it takes FOREVER to find anything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is garbage. Don't buy it unless you are looking for the second class citizen of the zombie MMO genre. I purchased the game in Alpha some time ago and have thoroughly NOT enjoyed the few hours I have put in. Game mechanics are clunky and it feels like you're in a bad comic book while playing. The community (if you can call it that) is full of hackers and the developers have continually lied about the game and it's features. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The animations are stiff and lame.  There's no physics.  Other players kill you for no reason at all.  They could be holding an AK and you could be holding a can of beans or a flashlight.  They're gonna kill you anyway.  The point of this game is nothing.  It has no style.  It's lifeless.  I think the developers forgot they were making a video game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game that is only further backed up by their customer support. War Z is not ready for official release by a long shot and should have been delayed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was advertised as being so much more but in reality is a joke. There were supposed to be several maps with 100-400 square kilometers but there is one map with 10 square kilometers. There is a disgusting spawn timer of 1 hour that was apparently patched to be even worse today and now when you die you must wait 4 hours to respawn. Fan boys argue that you have 5 characters to play. Well some of us don't want to play with 5 characters we want to cultivate 1! The graphics are ok for a game made 4 years ago. The controls suck and there is no toggle to crouch. The interface sucks. There are hackers everywhere. The developer's behavior is atrocious. They will ban you for so much as coughing. If they ban you from their forums they will ban you from their game too. And here I thought the censorship and moderation with World of Tanks was bad. Sergey Titov is like the Josef Stalin of video game developers. THIS IS HORRIBLE. -Not as advertised. -Horrible respawn timer mechanic. -Inconsistent pay model. -Dishonest and disrespectful devs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too many bugs, game needs major polishing. Also the game is loaded with hackers that face barely any penalties, so everyone's doing it. In turn making the game a very unpleasant experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game could have been great, it has a lot of potential. but I can't help to be bothered by the greed of these terrible developers, the game apprently isn't finished yet, but already charging high prices for additional items, and even respawns. Seriously 1 f*cking hour to respawn, or buy a respawn? That is incredibly stupid, as if isn't hard enough to survive, when conviniently you can't find what you need in the game when you need it most and to reach safe zones way too long, and too little of them. This game is complete sh*t and regret spending 15 on it, just to see I'd have to spend more to actually enjoy such terrible set up of game mechanics. Maybe one day this losers will fix this cheap money drain, but for now that's all it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Before i begin i need you to know Ihave had a chance to play this in Alpha, Beta and the current "Foundation Release".

The game as it stands today is very broken. It has been plagued by hackers, bugs, and multiple errors created by the developers. Moving past that the game it self plays out exactly as the popular ARMA II Mod "Day Z". You are set in this world to survive and explore. Easier said than done.

You will travel this world for many hours find very little in terms of items, Infact you will likely run into another survivor, a pack of zombies or maybe even a hacker and die before you actually find good gear.

Once dead you will have to wait 4 hours before you can play that character again. Unless of course you pay real money. This in it's self is a little shady.

Graphically the game is really hit or miss. From afar the scenery and world looks pretty whimsical, however once you get a closer look the textures look very awful and out of place. The animations are less than par what they should be. Players and zombies move very statically, almost robotic like, very inorganic. This ontop of the combat animations which are also terrible make the game look very cheap.

Overall my player experience has been very poor due to the lack of content, Shady micro transactions, Bugs, Hackers and much more. I would not recommend this until it has at least fixed the issues stated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game a month ago.  The Game is almost unplayable.  It's advertised as a Zombie Survival MMO.  But it falls way short of that promise.  The reality is -  it's a PVP Death Match with some Zombies throw in the back ground.  And there are way better Death Match games on the market. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought into this game in "alpha" for $25 which is outrageous to start of with.  Then they release it for less than $15 without giving anyone who bought in early anything? The game is actually fun to play but not because of the work the developers have put into it.  Since I started playing months ago they've only expanded the map a bit (most of the new places aren't even worth going to anyway), added clans which you have to pay for, and thrown on a terrible third person cross-hair.  Oh and they also increased the respawn timer to 4hours while adding a pay to revive feature. Shady.  This company is clearly milking a brilliant concept while putting in little to no effort.  Watching the gong show this game has become is more entertaining than the game itself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, let's see, the game proposal is perfect, a zombie MMO in a apocalyptic world. It were fun in the beginning, in the beginning of November. After that the game become crazy. LOT of hackers, LOT of players who just wanted to kill everybody without reason. I had real fun in the beginning. Now the game looks like **** Their promises looks like "We will do that...just 5 more minutes" nothing is working. Skills, engine, animations. nothing at all. I miss my 29 USD. Hope the game gets better, but for now, I've lost money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is unfinished. We need to let know to the dev that this is a bad practice. Barely works, lot of bugs, overall low quality of assets. This game is a no-go in the short term, and perhaps, in all its lifecycle. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I recently purchased this game from Steam and found that I had made a grave mistake.

I'm all for putting money towards the development of an unfinished game, if they mention beforehand that it is still in development.  Alas WarZ is advertised as release version 1.0.

This begs the question; what happened? How are the developers of WarZ allowed to sell this game through false information on their store page?  Not only is this game unfinished, broken, and filled with hackers, the developers actually make you buy credits to be able to continue to play,  if you happen to die do the many problems that plague this game, like dying by walking down a gentile hill (apparently the engine thinks you are falling).

My verdict is, don 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute piece of garbage.  This developer has from the beginning been lying and deceiving people about this game.  They have stolen various elements from another popular zombie game, and even the name was picked to sound similar to it to deceive people.  All for money.  Do not buy this game.  On principle alone, you should not buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, here is the deal. I purchased this game Oct 14th at the pioneer level. I played it and had a blast. I have been playing ever since and have seen all the changes that have been made. Some good, some not so good. I went into this knowing full well I was playing an alpha build and knew there would be bugs for a while and several changes would be made. Yes, I have played DayZ for some time prior to purchasing this game, and that is actually the reason I found this game. I never came into this spiteful that it was ripping off DayZ. I have read just about every rant and rave people had and also everything the developers came back with. It was a little hard to swallow but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I get killed a lot by bandits, not always hackers, but sometimes my deaths are too fishy to even have a doubt that some horseplay was going on. I just suck it up and load a new character and enjoy what time I spend alive in game. It has now become too much for me to stomach. Consistently being killed after 3 minutes in game is crazy. Take a look at Youtube and all of the hacks that there are for this game. I realize that they have banned over 3k people and that they are trying to fight it, but laying traps for people and banning innocent players is excessive. I have not even mentioned the fact that I payed what I believed was a "pre-release deal" at 40 some dollars, and now its on steam for around 15 bucks. I just dislike overpaying and being told I was getting a deal. Are you a game company comprised of used car salesmen? I have read Gamespys interview and I have just about had enough with this whole debacle. I don't even want my money back. I want an apology for making promises that you could not deliver and over charging me and many others to fund your development of this now third rate game. Sincerely
a once loyal fan 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SCAM! RIP OFF! SCAM! RIP OFF! SCAM!

Please read before you buy:

This game is a total rip off and scam. The developers are incompetent liars who are not fit to run a game. Avoid this game at all costs. I made the mistake of making 8 or 9 friends and family members buy this game and boy was it a colossal mistake. Sergey Titov is a lying, greedy rat bastard. Please do not support him and this game. Ok on to the game: This game is filled with hackers, completely ruins all the fun. They have features like pay for clan that you have to pay for. They have 4 hour long deathtimers that you can buy your way out of with real money. They don't have many features that they told us they would have. Everything is delayed. Basically they are a bunch of liars and all deserve to be sued or go to jail for this scam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is one of the ten worst games I've ever played. Some fun facts: This game was also supposed to get a PC release, its own comic book, and Vivendi Universal was supposed to publish the game in Europe. But thanks to the fact the game was unanimously panned by critics, it didn't get any of those things. The gameplay is imprecise and unpredictable which leads to numerous unfair deaths. The missions are boring and the levels are full of glitches such as the ability to go through walls or enemies get stuck on objects. The music is absolutely awful. The game's graphics look like N64 visuals in real-time to looking like a hideous PSone title during cutscenes. Let's not forget Drake has one of the worst storylines ever in the history of gaming. Avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you want a game that is enjoyably bad, with awful controls, combat, graphics, story, and just about every conceivable aspect, look no further than Drake. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't buy this game!! It is a rip-off. The graphics stink same as the martial arts. It is soooooooooo cheap. Every level all you have to do is kill the same people over and over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In metascore I would give this a 22. Cause the game is almost unplayable and the gameplay is terrible and this is the worst racer on the DS. This game is not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even if you're a big Flatout fan: do NOT buy this. It's a waste of money, disk space and has nothing to do with the previous releases. The physics are bad, the car handling sucks, the graphics hurts the eye. Even the menus are a pain to navigate. I repeat -- DO NOT BUY. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not recomended for those new and accustomed to the older flatouts    Flatout 3 shows High speed in races, a lot of variety and good graphics, but that's the only good thing. The physics are soooooo broken even the first flatout had awesome physics. The cars feel too light almost as if you could fly, and battling with oponents in this game is a bad ideia because you end up flying away while they stay the same. Car Damage is also unrealistic, reminds me of the older need for speeds. This should have been called "Bumper Cars chaos and destruction" because that's what it looks like, and even playing with bumper cars or riding them is a lot better than this.I strongly recomend to wait for "Ridge Racer Unbounded" which is being developed by the ones who made Flatout 1, 2 and ultimate Carnage (Bugbear) and it promises better graphics, better gameplay and the most important, better Physics.Overral: This game should have never been released. It's a TOTAL disapointment 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics are hidious, the menu's are VERY buggy and cheap, and the cars are undrivable. It is waste of money. Even Flatout 1 (from 2004!) is better. Do NOT buy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a horrible followup to two great games. Let's start off with the game modes - no season mode to speak of which were in previous games, and the stunt challenges have been replaced with a simple bullseye-type challenge in different game locations. No Ring of Fire, High Jump, or any other stunt challenges that were iconic in the previous two games. Next, let's talk about the handling - well, we can't, it's nonexistent! When trying to turn, you car flies all over the place. And if you do try to brake at turns, the AI opponents completely run past you like they can handle perfectly. This makes it extremely difficult to win races, even on the easy setting. The various modes in the game are completely pointless - they make it seem like it's completely different, but in fact, it's just races with a night setting or races with monster trucks. The game is far too fast-paced to get into - they make it feel like it's some sort of simulation game instead of a fun, crazy racer. I could go on but I'm sure you understand by now that this is a horrible game, and an insult to the first two games which were great. Team 6 should be ashamed as this is one of the worst games, if not the worst, released this year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok I'm going to fill you guys in on the details here so you know exactly what the problems are. There's a lot of problems that I'm listing so I'm going to really apologize for the length of this. But before you buy this game FLATOUT FANS PLEASE PLEASE READ THIS, HOLD YOUR WALLETS FOR A MOMENT AND THINK!! ......... There are few good points here and there but mostly bad points. The 2 good points about this game (which is why I'm giving it at least 2 points) is that at least the graphics are pretty decent and there are more variety of vehicles but truthfully thats about it!! ........ I own and have played all the original Flatout games, but this one is far from the originals that were made by Bugbear. The problems with this game is that you do not have your own garage and cannot do custom upgrades as you win money. You can choose more automatic PRESET upgrades as you progress in the game or keep your car stock. Sorry but thats not like Flatout at all and I personally dont like it!! .......... Another Issue is that it is virtually impossible to even get through the first race on challenge mode because your car wants to go anywhere but straight (even with turning down the steering sensitivity all the way) you car will spin out from absolutely nowhere and for absolutely no reason AT ALL!! Therefor NEVER even so much as getting in the 7/8 position. Your car will NEVER stay straight because the steering is WAY WAY WAY TOO OVER SENSITIVE!! Its like driving a corvette with a supercharged big block that pulls over 800HP and driving on sheer ice with bald tires!! While the laws of physics OVERLY apply to YOU, and DO NOT apply to your AI opponents!! Leaving you FOREVER in LAST PLACE!! ......... I truly just about s**t myself playing nightshift mode!! FORGET even playing that one!! In this mode its just you and one AI opponent. In this mode it does not matter how you set up your car or what car you drive, the AI opponent's car handles 10 times better than yours and goes 10 times faster than yours. You have absolutely a snow balls chance in HELL of beating that one!! You AI opponent can take a square 90 degree turn at full speed and is off the map in seconds flat, you on the other hand CANNOT and you're WAY behind in seconds flat!!! ....... Once again the laws of physics only apply to YOU and DO NOT APPLY to your AI opponents!! Sorry but thats BULLS**T!!! .......... Lastly when it comes to the way the cars wreck, the physics by far ARE NOT THE SAME!! When bugbear made the game, if you got hit in the tail, not only would the body bend but the tail lights also broke. In this games case lets say for example: You have round tail lights, and you get hit on the tail. Your tail light will take the shape of whatever the damage is (maybe oval shape) but the lens wont break and also takes the oval shape. NOT REALISTIC!!! Bugbear made the damage and other physics more realistic!! This game is FAR from realistic and MANY things will happen in this game that does not make ANY SENSE in SO MANY WAYS POSSIBLE!!! .......... The whole time while playing this game, my facial expression was ........ O_o .........or........(O)_(O) WTF!!.......... It really is not the original Flatout!! It just looks like it, thats all! Its still in some ways fun to play on certain modes and tracks but most of it is pretty sadistic and will piss you off horribly, and make you want to quit the game enraged!! I can only play this game for about 15-30 minutes before I end the game in utter disappointment because I cant get ANYWHERE in some of the races and leaves me very confused!! .......... I have always been very good and a pro at most race games and I even beat ALL of the Gran Turismo's on PS3 (which is one of the most advanced and customized racing games on today's market) and I honestly cant even get 7/8 place in this game ........... So truthfully that says alot right there!! ......... I'm glad I got this game at a discount because I truly dont even feel it was worth even the discounted price I paid. I am truly and utterly disappointed!! .......... Once again I'm sorry for the length of this but FLATOUT FANS, consider yourselves WARNED!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game at its core is fundamentally broken. The physics engine is a complete mess and the driving mechanics are terrible. I wanted to like this but there is very little about this game that was done good.
Even the loading bar is broken, yeah it has the most cars and all that but the cars don't work properly and when you crash all that happens is sparks fly off, where is the destruction. I don't care that you can break fences etc if I can't even break bits of my car like in the previous Flatout's, if a game from 2005 can why can't this. Luckily I got it in the Steam sale in the Flatout Collection so I didn't waste my money but I deleted pretty soon after playing it. This game is seriously a game you must avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

amazing how almost every positive review was written on Dec 20, 2011don't get fooled, those ratings are from the devs.FlatOut 3 is a joke. The best thing about it, are the graphics and those are mediocre.The AI is really bad, the tracks are unimaginative, the car physics are a mess (in both settings), the sound makes your ears bleed, and the devs are a bunch of self absorbed smegheads.Oh yes, the developers...know for real classics like "Monster Trucks: ULTRA MEGA EXTREME", "Motorbike Challenge", "Ultimate Monster Trucks", "Downtown Challenge", "Scooter War3z" , "Pizza Dude", "Taxi Raser" and "Copy-Paste (German, French, European, Shanghai) Street Racer".If you know any of those games, you know what you are in for.And don't believe those patch rumors. A: patch #7 will most likely never be released, since the publisher gave up on the game after 1 month...and i really can't blame them, because B: you can't patch fun into a game that is broken on so many levels.Trivia: FO3 is made with the same engine as the above mentioned games, a 11 year old in-house engine of a shovelware developer. This is probably one of the reasons, why this game drops 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

AWFUL!Im shocked at the system requirements. Quad core + HD 6950!. Even maxed out the game looks like a PS2 game!.F**K you ruining such an awesome game series 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a HUGE disappointment to the FlatOut franchise.  I was so happy to hear about a new Flatout game.  It is horrible.  It is extremely cartoony and boring.  The awesome flatout physics are gone and are replaced with physics like Mario cart.  All the characters with their own traits are gone two!.  Same with the stunt mode which was so fun during parties.  Also, Flatout UC had an awesome soundtrack that actually affected the way you drive.  Lets say you drove on a track listening to an upbeat song you would take all the ramps and drift round corners.  While with a dark song you would drive very seriously and drive on the a pecks.  Though in FO 3, it is all the same annoying trash techno music! Overall, this game is NOT focused on the same audience as the previous game and it is focused at 7-year old kids 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't get what's with all the hate its just the poor mans Nintendo land I felt it had some good things about it and if you find it in a dollar bin you may just have 30 minutes of entertainment :3 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Physics on arcade and N64 were too arcade but ruled! Unfortunatelly I can't tell the same about Wii version... physics simply feels silly with cars doing weird things. Furthermore graphics are from 2 generations ago. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only thing fun about this game is the control. The load time is rediculously slow - especially for the terrible quality of graphics that is rivaled by any game from 1992. Also, don't plan on using this game to end hours of bordom; it only took me about 3 hours to beat. Instead of paying $60 for this game consider picking up an N64 with Cruis'n Around the World. I'm actually annoyed that I bought this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While i love the concept of this game, and really want to like it, it's really not a well polished game. The interface is poor and the gameplay is downright shoddy. It's a sad thing that such an entertaining concept paired with such a horrible game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lets pretend that 'Nathan C.' isn't affiliated with the team who made this game.. I 'didn't listen to the negative reviews' and gave this a try anyway, just as an experiment. Guess what? this game is no fun. Its sad, but true. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only for serious DBZ freaks... Street Fighter 2 on the SNES played and looked better than this. Not to mention... The fighting in that game requred about ten times as much strategy as this one does. Once again, you'd really better like Dragon Ball Z if you're going to play this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game isnt all that great. very bad graphics, bland gaming, definatly the worst DBZ game!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A disgusting piece of crap. I wasted 10 dollars on this. I was literally rooting for this game when others dismissed it. One thing I hate more then this game's missed opportunities, is myself for buying it. The ONLY reason this monstrosity gets a 2 is because I enjoyed Lana's death animation. SMACK GROUND DEAD. One helpful tip for those who consider buying this game. Download the trial. Then immediately delete it of your hard drive forever. BEHOLD THE AMY EXPERIENCE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This title is far from good. Its terrible. I have always played Horror games and seen many terrible games, and guess what? This is the worst game ive ever played and the worst money spent. First off, right off the bat the opening train scene is lagging. Then, animations are VERY amateur and mediocre. Also, the subtitles. Turning subtitles on is a must for some players who cant even understand what these horrible poorly done voice work is saying, however, the subtitles are not even right. Such as in subtitles, names are not spelled right, or some random name entirely. Example: "Mary, Lets call Regina". Neither of those names are even in this title. Next, Combat is broken completely. Hitting an enemy will be a 40/100% chance of working, due to faulty animations and broken configuration files. Save game points are terrible. Most chapters are about 1 hour long, and you die one time during it, YOUR STARTING THAT WHOLE CHAPTER OVER. 1 HOUR OF GAMEPLAY LOST! Some other issues is the game has HORRIBLE AI. Amy wont respond or come to you at times. Monsters sometimes just stand there like there mental. Then, here comes more! Theres a few areas in the game that have Mines. When this is bad. Because it takes alot of health away from you, and you need one of Amys powers for it, however a largely known bug causes that power to completely be removed from the power menu, making it impossible sometimes to use powers. The replay value of this title is TERRIBLE, and you dont even want to play anymore after 10 minutes of this poorly done BROKEN game. The controls are broken, clunky and very uncomfortable, so bad its unplayable for more then 1 hour before becoming disabled in your hands. The voice acting is poorly done, and is terrible. The graphics and visuals are better ON A EARLY ps2 game then this crap. So my final score?  Graphics: 1/10,  Sound: 3/10, Gameplay: 1/10, Replay value: 0/10. I do NOTTTTTT recommend you buy this game at all, in fact, i suggest you shoot your self in the face before you do. Like several other reviews said, $10 on your console of choice, can get you Hydrophobia, a fantastic survival horror game on a ship, you for $10 on PSN, you can get PRIMAL another fantastic horror title. So i suggest you go to your service... AND KEEP PRESSING THE FOWARD BUTTON, whatever you land on, no matter the price, im 100% sure its better then... AMY.   Final notes: I WILL CONSIDER CHANGING MY SCORE IF THE DEVELOPERS FIX THE TITLE IN UPDATES. UNTIL THEN, IM GONNA WARN EVERYONE ON EVERY GAME FORUM I EVER GO TO, TO NOT BUY THIS GAME. VECTORCELL DOES NOT DESERVE THAT MONEY THEY GOT FROM PEOPLE WHO WERE SUCKERED INTO BUYING THIS GAME, AND THEY SHOULD BY LAW BE REQUIRED TO REFUND EVERYONE SINCE THIS GAME IS NOT WORKING RIGHT. SONY AND MICROSOFT, DO SOMETHING NOW! TAKE IT OFF THE STORE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Packing potential to be named "One of the worst" 'AMY' features countless opportunities for players to "Rage" as 'PS2' style game play stands out as out dated and unoriginal. AMY could even make games such as 'Duke Nukem Forever' and 'Velvet Assassin' look good, as player cry in desperation for a much needed end to this horrible game. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Amy is a stain on the gaming market. Poor mechanics and retarded A.I, this game is just baaaaaaaaad. I have to give it credit for at least trying to make an actual survival horror game, but that's about it. If you're looking for a GOOD survival horror game, I'd go with Amnesia: Dark Decent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too frustrating, non-intuitive controlling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. Truly Terrible. This game has major technical flaws that cripple any fun there might have been in the game. Camera control is non-existent, you'll find yourself running out of rooms you just ran into as the perspective changes instantly. For some bizarre reason, there's practically no elements of classic Leisure Suit Larry games present. Rather than chasing girls and dates using cheesy pickup lines, you will spend your time doing mindless tasks like cleaning up grafiti and delivering packages for fat guys. What's up with that? What's unforgivable though is that despite everything, the game just isn't fun. Plenty of flawed games manage to be fun (Resident Evil 5 comes to mind), but LSL BOB is not fun in any way. Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the worst game I have EVER played. It spits on everything that the series stands for. It almost feels like they were trying to make a PG rated porno. The only reason I give this even a 2 is that some of the artwork is pretty and it does have the voice talent of Carmen Electra. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Repetive gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hey everyone, DarkZX here, I just want to say before you read this review, this game will piss you off in so many ways imaginable. Anyways continuing, the game introduces 10 sports, all of which are hard to play due to horrible controls. It was a ridiculous excuse for an idea that has been overused many many times. The only reason I am not giving this game a 0 or a 1 is because it is a good filler game (game to let out your anger on while waiting for a new game). There isn't anything else to say about this game.Final Rating: 21/100Consensus: Don't buy it.... seriously buy another game that actually has a little something called good controls.If you want more reviews like this, sign up today at http://gamerspurgatory.darkbb.com , We have an awesome community where you can just chill, take part in contests, chat, play on online servers, and all sorts of other cool things. My username is the same there (DarkZX). Just request a review from me, I review video games, movies and music. Cya guys later!

Very disappointed.

I purchased this title with great enthusiasm; the trailer was sharp, and the concept seemed sound/innovative. However, I had this sinking feeling things were going to take a turn   for the worse very quickly once I got my game. Upon launching the game it failed to let me click on the button for registration. Once I got the registration done by manually logging into their site, the client locked up while trying to download my "Characters" which I had not created yet. That is an issue that has existed for over a month; related to their database provider underestimating the needs of the game (which are still obviously underestimated).

Then I finally get in after retrying 6-8 times, only to find out that I cannot play a two player game, and that we have to wait until four are ready to play. The fourth didn't show up in the twenty mins that I waited DURING the Steam summer sale; only a total of 17 people were online and playing the game during what is likely to be the hottest time for the game since release day.

What looks great in the trailers is a dog in the kennel. The game should have local servers, the game should support 32-bit Win7, the game should, the game should, the game should...a lot of should's and not enough do's in my opinion. This game is not going to last...so much for my $10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How did the developers get away with this. Honestly, the worst game of the year possibly. Personally, as a fan of the genre, I actually found some redeeming qualities in this game. The single player is fun if your only interest is killing nonsensical enemies for trophies. As a quick Platinum this game is recommended. Bear in mind you'll also need three or four willing helpers for the online trophies since NOBODY goes on the online. Aside from mindlessly easy trophies this game is good for nothing. The graphics aren't a next gen standard and at best it reminds me of one of the 2005 Xbox 360 games, or a late PS2 game. Absolutely no innovation in this game at all, and although it's based on the autobiography of 'Demo Dick', they seem to suck all emotion and character development out of the story with horrible cutscenes and terrible timing and script writing. If your a fan of a sadistic level of vulgarity or want an easy platinum then possibly rent it. If you see it for below 99p anywhere, your purchase will be justified. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

brightness issues controls are passable story is so generic i would rather have a odd coloured poo which would entertain me more
graphics take time to load which for a game that you are unable to see where you going is ODD
online has trophies which has stopped me from obtaining platinum 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can think of very video games that have made me laugh, completely unintentionally of course, as much as GoDai: Elemental force. Supposedly a third person action game GoDai gets virtually everything wrong. The fighting mechanics are ridiculous (It’s possible to make a great deal of progress by simply doing a slow motion roly-poly over and over again!), the graphics are barely PSone standard and the enemies only seem to know about three phrases that they choose to repeat every ten seconds.

It will likely provide you with a good twenty minutes of comedy gold but you won’t bother putting it back in your console again after that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lacking any tutorial based anything, and no real single player experience, Basement Crawl is a Bomberman clone that feels more like a bad Twisted Metal side game than anything else. I experienced a lot of server lag, and the art makes it hard to see what is exactly going on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The following review was posted by Rik one of our writers over at simplyplaystationgaming.com

It was not supposed to be like this.

When Bloober first announced Basement Crawl, it’s fair to say that I got very excited.

My first experience with Bomberman was in the late 90′s in a combination of booze and local multiplayer mayhem. It was absolutely insane.

For anyone that has never played Bomberman, the core gameplay here is that you’re a character and your goal is to kill all other characters. Essentially there are three ways to kill someone in Bomberman, by setting traps, by trapping someone in a corner or by deviously panicking someone into suicide. You all start off in different corners of a static map needing to bomb through brick to get to other players to build up the excitement and then there are the power ups and evil ups to keep you on your toes. There is a balance that’s hard to explain and it’s simply one of the best multiplayer games. Ever.

So… You’ll forgive me that when I saw the first video of Basement Crawl that I made an instant connection and the game went on my “day zero” buy list.

I also went vocal about this, explaining my thoughts to PS4 mates. For less than a tenner it was considered by all to be a fair bet to increase the number of PS4 titles owned…

The week leading up launch day, 26th Feb, was genuinely exciting. We had planned a session in the SimplyPSGaming community. Being fully aware of launch day issues we went in with an open mind. It was still a bit of a disaster to put it positively.

So, I found a news article the next day that suggested that feedback was welcomed, so I emailed the following based on launch night:-

I play in a community (simplypsgaming) and last night we had 7 of us trying to connect together to play.

Firstly, when it works it’s blinding and brilliant.

However I saw the following issues: -

- game would hang on the screen where it shows the controls
- game would start and clock would be counting down but there would be no players or blocks
- game would start and clock would be counting down but there would be no players spawning
- game appeared to have some invisible players that were playing and laying bombs but I couldn’t see.

Four of my friends found the following issues: -
- whether following an invite or browsing to a game, the players list would be empty – these guys would often be stuck on this empty waiting for game screen
- some would see the game crash

I didn’t think I got it too bad but overall the night was not considered a success.

Some things we discussed that would improve the game/interface…

- give the players colours (red/brown/yellow/green/blue/pink/white/black?) – when playing with people you know it would be handy to have a better feel for who you’re stalking and it makes it more personal. You could provide a key of colours vs players too. When playing with multiple friends it’s good to know who you can throw banter at over party chat. Having multiple versions of the same character with exactly the same colours ruins the personal revenge aspect for sure!

- have a private function where you can choose not to have randoms joining you. This was definitely annoying.

- what is global rank? Any chance of showing when you progress global rank – maybe a profile page?

I’m happy supporting the game so let me know if there is anything else you’d like feedback on or whether you need any assistance in testing any patches so we can start to play this game regularly in the community I’m in. :)

The canned response:-

Hi Rik,
thanks a lot for your feedback, we are currently working on solving these issues and adding new features to the game. Sorry about your problems.

Pozdrawiam/Regards

Now, more than a month later, it’s a game that I can’t play. The lack of SP campaign, not living with other gamers and it being dropped by many players means that the hectic MP action is not delivered. On the rare occasions when there is a lobby that has more than one player, I am not able to connect.

In the meantime my understanding is that Sony are telling people to wait for the patch before they provide a refund.

Please fix it soon, Bloober! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible game by all accounts. I can simply not understand the positive user reviews. Utter garbage it is. Sure, it may provide some guilty pleasure, But sucks so, yeah. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shameful to release such a half finished, disjointed, and empty game.   Terrible quests, empty maps, cliched forgettable characters and terrible voice talents.
Even if every single bug gets patched, at the core is a terrible game.  You can't patch that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it's obvious to see this game sucks. reality pumps are getting to a hell of pieces.
i rather to play the abysmal risen 3 than ever play this thing again. my official contender to the worst game of 2015. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The cartoon graphic is nice but gameplay is just bad. A one lvl game with good intentions... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

terrible, i actually enjoyed it a little bit for some of the stealth kills, should really have been third person with the option to go first person for shooting. bit like hitman blood money. its like a ps2 shooter has been ported to the X360. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rogue Warrior is of course a terrible game, but the worse part of it all is that Bethesda actually agreed to publish this piece of crap. I have lost so much respect for them as a Game Publisher. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an abysmal failure! The aiming was terrible, the enemies ai was dumber then a nail, graphics/sound were pre-gen garbage. I'm a fan of Dick Marcinko and I'm really surprised he did'nt kick the crap out of Bethesda for making one of the worst games out there. Bethesda by the way made Fallout 3, Morrowind - what were they thinking when they made this game? Avoid this game at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off when you review a game remember to understand the difference between a developer and a publisher. Was the game bad? Yes. Did Bethesda make it? No. They were just publishing it trying to help another company with it's idea. Bethesda is too busy crapping out AAA titles to screen what they publish it seems though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I haven't done and won't be doing a full length review for this game because I would essentially end up saying the same thing over and over. Sadly, this is one of those games where I could just imagine it being terrible before I'd even played it, and boy was I right on the money. Speaking of money, don't waste yours on this junk- and junk is what it is. It's always sad when a studio puts in "work" on a game that is inevitably so terrible that it's hard to imagine somebody actually crafted it over a long period of time. Literally the only thing interesting about this game is that Rambo in-game has about the same expression as Sly had throughout the entire Rambo series. Other than that, this is an entirely too much on rails game that can't even do on-rails correctly, and ultimately falls into the hellish abyss of crappy games. I'm being pretty generous just giving it a score of a 2, as that is probably more than it deserves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

F'''ing horrendous it has awful graphics and cutscenes, what is this sh't you ask it is a f''''ng rail shooter, with awful perks don't buy this and use the money to buy mgs gz a piece of sh't is this game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, Rambo. Rambo, Rambo, Rambo... What are we going to do with you? First of all before we get into what is so, so wrong about this game, let's go through the things that were good about it. Number one is that it made me appreciate how good the Rambo films are (well most of them) because of how different they are to this game. Number two is the constant enjoyment I get out of nearly every aspect of life, knowing that life will never get as bad as that horrible time I endured the torture of this video game. Number three is that it has made me appreciate free movement in video games. And finally the fourth thing the game has taught me is that trailers can sometimes make the game seem better than it is. And then there are trailers, like the one used for this video game, that not only exaggerate how good the game is but also straight up lie to you. So, ironically the things I liked about the game were the things that it made me appreciate while not playing it and the things it didn't ruin. Right, now onto the relentless criticism. The price is the main issue here and all of the other waste in the game simply revolves around it, like flies orbiting some dog faeces. The fact that someone can charge £30 for this in this day and age is a disgrace to the human race. I would not think this game deserves this to reach the price of an arcade game. I would not expect this deserves to reach the price of a free to play game. The price I would say this game is worth of is in the minus numbers and even then, it would have to be a pretty big sum. I think that the developers of this game should pay people to play it. It's that horrible. Here's why. It's a rail shooter (a shooter that does not allow you to move, just to shoot) in 2014. In 2014, actually no scrap that, let's go back 10 years. In 2004, we did not have rail shooters. We had games like Star Wars Battlefront (a much better game released 10 years before this), FIFA 04 (a much better game released 10 years before this) and the list goes on and on, but you get the point. Having a rail shooter in this century, let alone year, is unacceptable. The graphics as well as the gameplay are horrendous, another aspect of this travesty that shouldn't be allowed to be so bad. The character model of Rambo, looks nothing like Rambo. It looks like a child picked up their favourite doll and then dressed them up like Rambo. Actually on the subject of character models, all of the Vietnamese people in the game look the same. Not only is this an insult to the people who bought this game, but link this with the racist attire they are wearing and it becomes an insult to the people of Vietnam. The voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard only second to that of Ride to Hell: Retribution. It also doesn't help that the game lacks a story and for most of it has you, Rambo and I'll repeat that, RAMBO, mowing down policemen. So not only did the developers get the graphics, the gameplay, the story, the character models and the overall feel of the game wrong, but they also managed to, and there's no other way to put this, screw up the character of Rambo, the literal name of the game. Giving this game a 2 is generous, the only reason I rated it so high is the joy it gives me in knowing I never have to play it again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So if your reading this review right now, your probably considering picking up this game. "It's one of the cheapest games for the DS" you say. "There's nothign else to play," you also state, while begging and asking why this game should even be considered. Don't pick it up. The mini-games are shallow and take no brains. The character customization is equally as shallow, delivering in no redeeming qualities. This game really doesn't even need to exist, and it existing is just more proof that the DS needs some good titles now, and luckily some are coming out soon. As for now, be patient, and resist the urge to buy a mess and a sad disgrace of a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Anymore I see this game going for $15 at EB Games and GameStop and other specialty stores. How does this sound? I bought the game for $3 at K-Mart. That's about all it's worth, because the minigames that can be played with this you can play with a pen and paper. A few pens and a pack of paper costs about $3. It's also a chatting application, but who's gonna use that when there's a chat program built into the DS? Simply put, Ping Pals is one of the dumbest ideas for a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This entire package contends for worst game ever - it's literally unplayable. It's only saving grace is the London Philharmonic sountrack and the decent cinematics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No tutorials when the game is complex. The controls are really bad. Graphics are good for a gamecube game. The game is hard cause it ain't playable. Plot ain't so bad but this game deserves to be skipped. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ill keep this short and sweet. This is a extremely low quality title that you can beat in one sitting. It has terrible visuals, gameplay and offers no challenge. The only reason one might seek to rent this game is the easy achievement factor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave this a 2 cos' when it works i actually had some fun playing it... although the game is so uninspiring in places.... but my problem is that it is so unstable and buggy. It keeps crashing my pc and even stops other programs working!! I am astounded that any gaming studio could release this.... if you pick it up on console for bargain bin prices its worth it, but only then. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really tried to give this game the benefit of the doubt despite my instant reaction within the first 5 minutes of playing, but ultimately my initial response to this game remained the same throughout. I was actually happy that it was as short as it was so I could put it down and never play it again. What a waste of my money. I really wish Steam could give refunds and apologize for selling you absolute crap. I liked the voice-acting by Mr. Rourke, I even liked the way the guns recoiled when using the sights. Add to that that the music was pretty spot on for giving you some energy as you play, but other than the things I just mentioned...A game that could have been something more. I had expected some sort of Splinter Cell"esque" type of title based on the trailers, etc. but I found myself playing a tired game that reminded more of playing Goldeneye on the N64 than any sort of modern game. I'm sure the multiplayer would have been nice, but there is only one problem...There is no one playing it. Do yourself a favor and buy something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible controls, terrible AI, terrible graphics, shall I go on? There's little redeeming features to be found in this game, but one thing that is worthy of merit is Mickey Rourkes horrible voice work which is borderline hilarious sometimes, unintentionally though. There's nothing memorable at all and every game-play mechanic and story arc has been done before and much better. The campaign won't keep you around very long and there's literally  no replay value whatsoever, but if you feel like spending a few hours thinking you're trapped in a bad 90's movie, there are worse ways to get it done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this a 2, because its only 2 hours of gameplay for a $50.00 price tag. I knew Captain Marcinko and I was very happy to see his fiction series translated to an interactive format, but this game did not deliver on the potentiality of the character or the intellectual property. It is quite simply a stain on the face of Bethesda Software and on Richard Marcinko's face as well because while the game isn't exactly bad, you can literally play it over a long lunch break. As semi realistic shooters go, its fairly well done, the AI isn't terrible and the levels and settings are fairly good, but, just as you think you've completed the first tier of missions, and you're about to dive deeper into the story from there, you end up getting a credits screen and the game is over. This game doesn't even do justice to the books, much less the mans life and service to the United States, and its got to be the most unexpectedly horrible release in Bethesda Softworks history, simply due to the gigantic glaring and obvious fact of them dropping the ball with delivering a title that actually delivers engaging shooter game play with an enigmatic character that could have actually delivered at the very least 8 to 10 hours of single player story line...but no, 2 hours, it literally makes Modern Warfare 2 look good by comparison. Overall, a good attempt at a realistic shooter game from Bethsoft, but, falling far short of the mark in regards to the expected level of professional development you'd have hoped BethSoft would have taken with a title this potentially lucrative. Don't buy it til it drops to $10.00 in the bargain bin, cause that is about all its worth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If one day Uwe Boll wants to make video games instead of creating movies, the result will most likely be Rogue Warrior. To put it simple, this game truly is a piece of crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very harsh game play, if the designers have thrived upon a goal of boring the user to death with shoddy dialect an lame game play, then congratulations they have achieved there goal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(Rolls eyes) wow now this is a surprise a GBA based on a show who knew it would have generic boring gameplay, and annoying multi-player and replay value is pretty much non-existint wow I thought it would be good I wanted to give it a 10. (In case you are stupid I knew this game would suck.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

they really should have scraped using the Wii u and just used the Wii then it would have been at least a little more use able but hay if its in a dollar bin you may get 30 minutes of entertainment 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Massively disappointed in how this turned out. One of the worst football games ever produced, and I've played some downright stinkers in my time.

For anyone to actually feel this deserves praise for just existing is a tad delusional, and really not helping the developers to learn from their mistakes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are pretty good, especially movies. Unfortunately, this is the only good point, because the game is far too linear and simplicistic to be at least interesting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is an example of what will happen when Publishers decide that they not only want to manipulate peoples soft spots and nostalgia for a huge series like Pro Skater that hasn't gotten a sequel in years, and try to turn this nostalgia factor into pure revenue. This idea, just as well, would be if the developers/Publishers decided to skip BUG TESTING. THERE IS SO MANY BUGS IN THIS GAME, THAT I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF ANY OF THE DEVELOPERS OR PUBLISHERS TESTED MORE THAN THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS OF PHYSICS AT ALL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The levels are bland. Let me start off by saying that. They feel open and don't give you that 'exiting Tony Hawk feeling' that you get from the older games.It's just the little things, like you automatically do a wall ride if you hit a wall, but, in the other games you had to press a button while you were hitting a wall. This takes all the skill out of some of the tricks, adding to the bland feeling that this game gives off. Also there is one other thing that really annoys me. Let me explain: in the old Tony Hawk games restarting was easy. You thought: 'oh, i'm not going to complete this mission in time'. You hit start, press down once or twice and hit restart. The load times were minimal or none and you were back in the game, skating along. In the first Tony Hawk game It took me about 5 seconds to restart and finish loading. In Tony Hawk 5 however, to restart you have to hit Start, press down 4 times, hit restart. Then it comes up with dialogue saying 'do you want to restart?' Then you had to hit 'yes', wait for it to load and FINALLY you were back in the game. After a while this gets aggravating, and makes you want to scream. Also they messed up the placements of items. In the old Tony Hawk you would have a certain amount of minutes or seconds to get however many objects, that were scattered around the map. In this game you might have to get a large number of items, maybe 50, for example, and they are all grouped in one place. Oh, here is 15 right next to the spawn! Grind over here and get the other 35! Now let's look at the multiplayer aspect. Collision? No! You are in a small space with a bunch of other skaters doing... nothing. Sure, you can turn on voice chat, but i'd rather play singleplayer. Actually, I wouldn't! BECAUSE IT SUCKS! I give this a 2/10. Note that this is an above average score. Don't buy this game, not even if you want to complete your Tony Hawk collection. 60 dollars is waaaay too much to pay for this piece of crap. There are conspiracy theories that Activision's contract is running out with Tony  so they  wanted to make their probably final game in the series so bad as a punishment to curse the next company that might end up with it. Personally I think this is not true. Cos' it's just a sh*t game. End of story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, its out. I am a MASSIVE fan of the tony hawk games, they rank up there with metroid and phantasy star to me as my most beloved franchises, so it pains me to say this. WITHOUT NEVERSOFT THERES NO REASON FOR THIS FRANCHISE TO EXIST ANYMORE! There its said.

Robosucko or any other company simply isnt capable of making these games the way they deserve to be made. I am sure several people already have gone through the laundry list of things worng with the game, so im going to skip that. Instead im going to point out the things that bothered ME the most.

1. They put lil waynk in the game! I mean as stupid as octodad is to have in the game this 1 move says everything about how seriously they take game development.

2. The soundtrack is generic rubbish. Usually a hallmark of tony hawk pro skater games this time it seriously all sounds like garbage they found on soundcloud.

3. Slamming sucks! At first i thought it was a neat mechanic, but oh no.. it DESTROYS all your muscle memory from the previous games, you essentially have to re-learn how to play and do combos (more on that in a minute). I think the mechanic itself is part of the developers lack of ability, they couldnt get the physics to work properly so they added a way to force gravity.

4. In a move pretty common among older franchises (::ahem:: elderscrolls! ) they have made alot of mechanics retard easy for the learning impaired children of today. For example it used to be when you lost your "balance" in a manual or grind you FELL, not anymore, nope you just skate right out of it and lose your combo. Maybe its to make up for the asinine slam mechanic being so unwieldy or something but you cant chain tricks together like you used to because theres some sort of "safety" animation in there.

5. No more custom specials. As with #4 they nolonger feel players need to perform quick combos to do special tricks, instead you hit the bumper and you ARE special (kids these days are so "special" it make me want to vomit).. everything you do will AUTOMATICALLY BE a special. I find it insulting, you also cant customize what these "special" tricks are for the record.

6. The art style doesnt fit. Its some sort of hybrid cell shading and it really just looks like sloppy filth i have been seeing on pc for years.. why develop a game using the unreal engine if its going to look and behave like some piece of trash some indie devs made with effing unity?

7. The menu buttons are in the wrong place.. (im inclined to call them start and select) yea, you hit the menu button on the left and it pulls up a menu pane on the right and vice versa. So the question becomes did a mentally deficient person design this game, or did they just not listen to playtesters AT ALL? While its technically a separate gripe entirely in just going to shoe-horn in here the fact that the voice chat is also OFF by default when in free skate.. yes you have to go into the options menu and turn it on.. IDIOCY!

8. Menus. As you go through the game sometimes you will want to add or remove stats to complete objectives (more grind, speed, or manual), to do this you have to COMPLETELY leave the session you are in and go to the main menu and then edit your skater. Since everything is online this means load screens which means a pain in the ass because you then have to go back INTO the map you were just on and choose the mission to do. You also cant simply switch maps.. oh no.. you get to make that trip BACK to the main menu to choose another level.

9. The physics are just plain sloppy. Some times you have to hit balls out of a pool for example, but there seems to be no real rhyme or reason to how far they go when hit at a certain speed. Alot of the times when trying to initiate a tight grind you end up doing a lip trick or cheesing it entirely (because of the asinine slam mechanic). Its just not FUN anymore at this point, its frustrating. Again as a fan of the franchise i am VERY used to frustration, but when the problem isnt my skills but wanker coding its a very different feeling.

10. Generic everything, but especially skaters. Why have any more than 1 skater if they are all going to essentially have the same stats and since skins are unlockable? Theres really no reason FOR It! BUT they went through whatever they went through to put lil waynk in the game.. i hope they dont pay that assclown for anything.. if anything i hope he bankrolled the entire development. The skins you unlock are also less than impressive, be it stickers or heads, bodys or boards theres just variations on 1 thing or another. Several snow man heads, several bucket heads, several cop uniforms, several logos with different color backgrounds. THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL HERE!

Having typed this all out i hope it helps somebody. i was going to give it a 4 when i first started typing, but having actually spit it all out its getting a 2. No really, thats all it deserves.. i didnt even cover the gimmick poewerups. Positive reviews lie! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing this I think I'm going to go apply for the game developer. Do I have experience or know what I'm doing? NO! But I'm pretty sure neither do they! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a Lifelong Skater from late early 90's trust me when I tell you Tony Hawk is only liked OUTSIDE the skate community..
---Onto THPS- No wonder all The Skate-3 fans are screaming for Skate-3 to be released on Playstation Now or be XBOX One Backwards Compatable.. probably gonna happen now..and probably gonna postpone Skate 4 or whatever newer skate game by over a year..
---I am not concerned about the cost of this game. If it were fun then BETitUP ill pay the $60 and smile..But this would anger me if it were $10 bucks..
-usually my gaming time is th emost valuable to me..in this case it was me wanting a next gen Skate game.
-Whats funny is how many people are thinking about theyre PS2's right now.....

--how could this happen?
--I feel th eowrse for the NON-SKATERS hwo looove THPS. Because theyre childhood memories just got dumped on..
--THPS is responsible for a resurgence of young skaters learning to skate back in the late 90's and I was sooo naïve to think it was gonna happen again.

---Can this be patched or DLC'd or updated/repaired with creat a park etc???? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fans of the Tony hawk series will probably look back at the old games and remember all the goods times it brought them, with it's great humor, solid level design and understandable controls....for the most part. But Pro Skater 5 is very different....It has it's moments of enjoyment when playing it but there are to many other horrible problems that ruin the experience. Constant glitches with physics and collision detection make landing tricks and getting around the map horribly difficult and aseptically a chore. The map design it's self is a step back from the old games, The old Tony Hawk games had interesting maps with hidden parts, Interesting Gaps and just felt all around immersive. The new maps feel just slapped together without to much thought and the parts that do feel thought out aren't that unique.There is a small list of skaters you can choose from and also customize your....sort of. It's more like you slightly alter other skaters into your own, witch is somewhat of a horrible why to handle character creation. Music to the game almost felt like everyone who worked on the game all picked some songs and put them on a playlist, some songs feel extremely out of place. If your looking for a good Skateboarding game For PS4/XBone I must say your out of luck at the moment, Skate 2-3 still hold the crown for console Skateboarding games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 sadly fails to capture any of the fun or engaging gameplay elements that once made the series great. It's buggy, the controls feel clunky, and the game just lacks fun.

First and foremost, the game does not deserve to cost $60. There are a total of 9 maps, all of which feel small and thrown together without much care for their actual enjoyment levels. Nothing about any of them feel charming or noteworthy, instead feeling like 'The token school level' or 'Let's go to space, I guess'. None of them feel like something I'd want to play, given the choice.

The UI is flawed and spends a lot of time sending the player through the same clunky menus over and over for no real practical reason. The addition of a new mechanic, the 'slam', might have been interesting had it not been bound to the grind button. As it stands, all it's good for now is throwing off your combos.

Lots of elements of the older games are missing, such as the ability to shift your grind and manual type mid-move. Additionally, a significant number of techniques are locked behind the special meter now (such as pretty much every special manual like the handstand and most grinds beyond 'tailslide'). Because the bar doesn't fully register being full until after your combo ends, you get one special bar per combo, making it very difficult to create high-scoring lines at once.

The new powerups (such as giant skater, flaming board, and double-jump) are level-specific and feel incrediby gimmicky without adding much to the game.

Various bugs make the game hard to play too. Grinds breaking for no reason, bailing instead of landing a vert... it all makes it very hard to play the game.

Gameplay is nothing more than an endless string of "Get huge combo in X area". "Get huge combo to stop your head exploding" (oh right, for some reason bighead is now a game mechanic? Odd decision), "Get lots of points by grinding", "get lots of points from manuals", before moving onto the next area and doing it all over again, but with bigger numbers as the objective.

Just rent it. Probably no more than two nights, really. That's all you'll need to get tired of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the most disappoint game of the year in 2015, and it probably will kill the Tony Hawk Franchise.  This game is a blatant cash grab and no one cared about this game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slow as molasses frame-rate at times, levels that are clearly rushed and poorly structured, amateur user interface, and hardly any content for the asking price of SIXTY DOLLARS. Skating around can feel great at times, but the rest of the game is bad that it doesn't matter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When the best thing you got in your game is Lil Wayne, that says something
And speaking oh him, this game has more glitches than the amount of tattoos he has
#rekt 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

you pay 60 bucks. What do you get. Early 7th gen graphics, bugs, crappy physics. It could have been nice a as a budget game, but no, we are not stupid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have a question for the developers: why? We told you about the bad physics (you can't even grind two rails in a row without bashing down), terrible cast (added amateur woman skaters just because they couldn't find enough professional ones and had to remove rodney mullen, chad muska, bob burnquist to balance it, which is awful), and bad game design.

You had plenty of time to fix it. Why didn't you do it? I'm taking this game back to the store. I honestly don't know who's the target audience. I just hope Tony Hawk never trusts Robomodo again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Update, as I just want to say a few words on this game. Firstly the graphics are terrible for a next gen game, the seem like a a ps2 game at times. The sound and music are just crammed in and totally uninteresting. The missions and gameplay are the same mini games over and over. At best this game is worth say, 10$, AT BEST. It's a cheap digital game that belongs on a tablet. But this is a full price game!! FYI I try to give balanced reviews and not or never have been a fan boy of any type. This game is genuine garbage. Is it a coincidence that the publisher is activison. I think not. Yes this make good games sometimes, but they are also known for being somewhat dodgy. This proves it. It's a total rip off. Please do not buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Magus is a surprisingly bad PS3 game; if I were told it is a PS2 game, I would definitely believe it.

The technical aspects are simply awful (particularly the graphics), and the storyline is nonsensical and dull from beginning to end. Gameplay is extremely repetitive and the settings are almost empty with the exception of enemies. You will end up getting bored quite soon.

Without a shadow of doubt, Magus is the worst video game I ever played on PS3. Unless you want to know how bad a PS3 video game can be, do not play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the few times that I bought a game without looking at reviews first. what a mistake. Just plain awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried this at a friend's house.  This game is SOOOOO Terribly executed with fight after fight after fight over and over, with a semi-lack of response.   All you get out of this is a workout because you pretty much have to do twice the work to get the normal result. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I signed up to Metacritic to warn people about this game. I thought a Kinect game from Ubisoft would be a safe bet... and I couldn't have been more wrong. Fighters Uncaged seems to be a simple conversion of a controller based game, rather than being designed for Kinect: you make certain moves with your body to trigger certain moves in the game just like you would press certain button combinations in a controller game. That's where it fails as a Kinect game: using a controller you can feel that you pressed the buttons, but using Kinect you're left unsure if you're moving your body in the correct way to trigger the move. Worse yet, the moves you can make are conditional on whether you're supposed to be attacking or dodging, and whether you're close or far from your target. For example, if you make a dodge move, your character in the game will only show a dodge animation if there is a punch or kick to be dodged. There's nothing to show that you did the correct movement, and that left me feeling very frustrated with the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

RUBBISH.

i love ubisoft and i put this down to kinect just coming out, but at least it tried to be a game other then a "starter pack2 game for kinect.

The fighting is fun untill you realise that thats it.....i meen theres about 15 fighters and all you do is fight them over and over and over and ZZZZzzzzzz.

In my mind i wanted it to be an arcade game like streets of rage or the bouncer where you beet a guy up then move forward like time crisis style but its not.
All you do is the same few moves and half of them dont even reconise the correct move and just dchoose some random move, hopefully it will do a random move for you and earn you an achivement though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful game. graphics are just awful at least borderland 2 meant to have comic graphics.grass just looks like a cardboard box painted green a laid on the ground.zombies are as stupid as a drunken hobo in fact the only highlight of this game is the voice acting of Norman reedus.do not buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WTF is this. This was terrible ive never seen anything more poorly excuted in my life. The only positive is the voice acting thats it. The survival aspects are gone in this. You have poor AI for zombies! Really how do mess that up i cant believe it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The back story to Daryl and Merle... was a FAILURE.  No wow factor, nothing in this game will want you to keep playing to the end.  It's pretty bad when you care less about the characters as the LEADS in a game as opposed to the TV show where they are not.  This game is worth a play at 10 bucks, but anything more and you're just getting ripped off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had high hopes for me being a hardcore fan of the series, then I played it, now this game had piss poor graphics to warz standard, and a combat system with  duh hit 3 times that'll do it" not much variety at all. So I expected the story and atmosphere to do something, like the telltale game, WRONG linear story, goofy walkers and no feel that the world went to  Now there are cool features like going in stealthy or Rambo-ing it up with guns but it made no difference, then there was alternate routes back roads used more fuel but more scavenge opportunities but then highways had lower fuel consumption but you break down more often. This cool except you can take the highways, use less fuel then break down and scavenge for supplies in same gas station you find every time with ZERO variety.
Then at the end SPOILERS!! you get a cliffhanger ending where Daryl and Merle drive off into the sunset  YOU it is mass effect 3 bad.
Then if you buy the dlc what happens oh some new guns and a absolute  survival mode that has 1 map and random weapons spawn. There is no tactics just shoot every thing in sight and drink some soda while your at it.
So final verdict is rental or pirate it cause it has potential bad terrible execution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh dear...another cash in.

This game is a dreadful FPS. It looks like it was made in 2005 not 2013.

Don't be fooled, this is not on par with the excellent series and looks like the result of a rushed, mess created to satisfy those who moaned that the first walking dead was a point and click.

At the end of the day this game smell of ploppy pants and doesn't deserve your cash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remember when a Dragon Age 2 developer hopped on here to shower praise on their half assed game. Seems alot like what's going on here.  reviews that read like a promo cash in. So, show of hands...how many that scored it 10 are employed by Activision, AMC or Terminal Reality? Ya I figured. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are some good things about this game, but they are countered by the many things wrong with this poor excuse for a licensed video game. The graphics are textureless, the story is dull and lacking (especially for walking dead) voice acting is awful, and most of all... there is no replay values. This game could have been soooo much more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a huge Walking Dead fan, but this game........ FANDBOYS, this game isnt worth the effort to defend. I was foolishly hyped up for it due to the excellent game "The Walking Dead", but instead we get a half assed, money grab. Not even the story could save this game!? Stop saying that the lowering of the price or the story. It sucks, its bad, please accept the fact that its bad and stop, watch the show and cry about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game blows massive chunks. Horrible plot and terrible graphics. I had hoped the game would've at least pleased me half as much as the Telltale game... So much for hope. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game felt like it was headed in the right direction then some executive just stepped in and said "Release it now!" despite the fact that it was only half done.

The controls are the worst example of this half baked feeling. VERY clunky which is a deal breaker in a zombie game where you need fast reflexes to dispatch them in close combat. Weapon swings take SO LONG it would be a death sentence to try and fight more than one zombie with just melee weapon swings even with something like a sledge hammer. Bottom line melee in this game is totally broken and useless.

The best way to kill them is just hitting RB then side stepping behind them for an "execution" which is also WAY too quirky and buggy to work reliably.

The firearms in the game work fine nothing special but there really no point in using them because they attract every zombie on the map to your location. So the best strategy ends up being to run past everything to the end which you can do on almost every map.

If you try and go the "stealth" route which is what they clearly push in the game then you can enjoy all the melee bugs and instances of them respawning zombies right behind you to add difficulty. Then also enjoy all those free scratch hits zombies get while you try to melee with their awful combat system.

The "survivors" you pick up along the way are totally pointless. You can send them out to scavenge but supplies are so plentiful there's never a point to doing this and it ends up being a total waste of time.

The last level is horrendously bad. I won't spoil it for you but when you finish off the game you will realize just how bad and half baked this game was.

I would have loved to see what they could have done with more time and money. A better scavenging/survivor system and a much more fluid melee combat system would have propelled this game into the "good" category for sure. Sad to see this get rushed out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a very big deception to the AMC TV show TWD. I love the series but the game is worse that I thought. The story is monotone, the sceneries are always the same as well as the zombies appearance. The graphics and the movements are very limited as well as the gameplay. In this game you don't have an emotion and a connection with your "partners", you can treat them as dolls. The only positive point is: you play with Daryl. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Playing through this game I maid a mental checklist of just about everything a game could do wrong.  Walking Dead Survival Instinct hit on all of them.  Invisible walls, check.  Horrible AI, check. Awful graphics, double check. Unresponsive guns that feel like a toy, check. Non-fluid animations, check.  I could keep going but you get the point.  This game is an insult to gamers and the people who buy games.  This should have been a $10 novelty game and even at that price it would deserve the scores it's getting.  The game is absolutely horrible with the only redeeming quality being that it's the only shooter where you can live in the Walking Dead world.  The devs and the Activision knew full fell this game would be horrible and they are doing damage control with user reviews.  It's actually worse than Alien Colonial Marines which I didn't think was possible.  Hands down worst game of the year and it's pushing worst game of the decade I've played.  There is absolutely no reason why this game should exist.  It's only there to trick gamers who don't follow review scores into thinking it's good because of the name only and to spend their hard earned money on this game (not even sure it should be called a game.)

Avoid at all costs unless you want to rent to find out just how bad it is for yourself  like I did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Huge fan of the television series. Unfortunately this game is nowhere near as good as the show or the Telltale game. This is a rushed title trying to cash in on the popularity of the show. The poor graphics wouldn't be a problem if the game had any substance. There's a total of 3 levels that cycle randomly depending where you stop. The zombies have terrible AI, the animations are horrendous, the voice acting was phoned in and the gameplay is boring.

If this was a $5 alpha build with claims of further development, I might tell friends to take a chance. But this is a full price pile of doodoo, pure rip-off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There really isn't much to say about this game apart from the fact that it is just plain awful I will start with the graphics which are a big thing nowadays. Even on the outdated Xbox 360 console the graphics are bad. This game looks like it is from the play station 2 old Xbox era and I have seen better graphics on Xbox live arcade games. But that's not the biggest thing for some people is it so I'll go say how the story is next If your a big fan of the walking dead like me then I beg you dont buy this game and fall into the trap like me and so many others have done. It's obvious this game was just a money grab and from activision that doesnt suprise me. You may be tempted with it having the dixon brothers in it like me and it also having the actual actors from the show for the voice acting but thats no reason to go and blow your hard earned cash on this crap game. The story is sub-par and doesnt do the show or the dixon brothers the credit and justice they deserve  You drive around from place to place with the game actually being scripted I kid you not scripted. When travelling from one destination to another if your hear dialog as you do so you will not I repeat will not find any supplies or have the opportunity to scavenge any places The ending was crappy too and was a huge letdown I managed to scrape through the game and was looking forward to seeing the ending as I thought that would atleast maybe make up for something but it doesnt This game just screams rushed. The gameplay is also very boring too like the story and the zombies are incredibly stupid too you can at times stand behind one for several seconds and they wont even smell you and turn around The zombies also re spawn too when leaving a area and going back Dont buy this game I would suggest renting it at best 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They should rename this title to "The Walking Disappointment". I think its amazing how the leaked trailer that was dismissed by Terminal Reality as not being actual gameplay, but in fact it was an exact representation of the game released! I really wanted this to be something special like TellTales TWD. What this game should of been was a 3rd  person open world game! where you can go around Atlanta surviving the outbreak in the same way you do in DayZ, but with a proper story mode with emphasise on the bond between the Dixon brothers as they struggle to survive the outbreak. You could have loot-able shops,house's, cars,warehouse's etc, in this game you cant even break a car window or jump over a small fence to go places that look accessible! The Walking Dead isn't going to stop any time soon! so the quick cash in was totally pointless. They should of taken a leaf from TT's book... oh wait you did, you wrote a review about your own game, like TT's self review of Jurassic Park. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, I wanted this to be a good game, but unfortunately it Isn't.

Sega's newest attempt at the blue blur fell remarkably short of most expectations. It's scattered with many bugs. While not gamebreaking bugs as some have described, many require you to restart the level. The game lags out at several points as well.

It's graphics are a huge disappointment. While some levels, such as Lyrics base, look nice at parts, other parts are downright ugly. At points it really does look like a PS2 game. On a system like the Wii U this is simply unnacceptable. In addition, after three years in development one would expect consistent graphics, but alas, no.

The gameplay is generally repetitive and I became bored within the first few levels. The difficulty is minimal, and while more enemies began appearing near the end, they are easily dispatched.

Music has been one of the consistent bright spots of the Sonic franchise, but unfortunately Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric bucks this trend. The music is unfitting at points and generally forgettable.

The major bright spot is story. The games story is far more advanced then the last four Sonic games combined. It does have a generic villain and stereotypical (and pointless) characters, which takes away from the enjoyment.

In an effort to appeal to new fans Sega has completely alienated it's original fan base. The game is not good enough to draw in many kids; nor Sonic enough to draw in the dedicated fan base. Sega has fell into a situation all too many companies fall into. In short, this game is very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic Boom: Rise Of Lyrics is unpolished - and even worse, flat out boring. Like, super boring. I tried to find something positive, I really tried. Trust me! But nothing about this game stands out - in a good way that is.

The graphics are sub-par, even bad. The music sucks - it's stuck in this ambient, cinematic mood and never stands out, ever. The gameplay is repetitive and the puzzles are dumb - you have slow button-mashing fights, then there's a bad puzzle, then a scripted speed section which will most likely glitch out. Rinse and repeat. The characters, oh man, they're annoying. They never shut up. The writing is an atrocity, with constant references to internet memes from 2010.

The only things I really liked were Amy's new personality, she's no longer incomprehensibly annoying, and Metal Sonic. He's always a nice villain. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had some hopes from me, I was expecting something different yet interesting. Instead, here's what I've found:
-Graphics that are lazily done, on the Crysis 3 engine no less
-the combat isn't as enjoyable as one would expect, it's different, but not satisfactory
-the humor is really degrading, especially poor knuckles, a character I respected in sonic adventure, sa2 and sonic heroes
-BUTTLOADS of glitches that SHOULD have been watched for, its like an early beta or late alpha build.

As a comparison, I'd have to state this is a lot like a bad spin off of The Legend of Spyro trilogy or the Spongebob Squarepants Movie (video game). The story, character model design, and voice acting isn't horrible, but the slowpaced action and horrible humor isn't something I was looking forward to. Three years of building, yet loads of bugs and graphics that could have been reworked before release if BRB had the common sense to actually do proper testing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me just put this to rest, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is not very good. It's horrible, it's quite possibly one of the worst Wii U games i've ever played. It had so much potential, when I saw a trailer for this game on TV, I thought it was going to be decent, but I thought very VERY wrong. The gameplay is boring, it's glitchy as hell, it runs like hell, it doesn't even look good! The game is somewhat funny, but it just makes the characters look like complete idiots. And don't even get me started on the character designs; I know the game was made alongside a different company, but still, whoever thought thought it would be a good idea to give Knuckles steroids needs to be fired.  All jokes aside, this game is horrible, and to be honest, I found more enjoyment out of Sonic 06 than this. If you see this game at any game store, don't buy it, if you're a hardcore Sonic fan, then be my guest.

Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric gets a 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game seems to fail on many, many levels. Bland textures, and Dreamcast level presentation, make this an ultimately ugly looking game. The gameplay itself is also dull, with repetitive, uninspired platforming and glitches throughout.

The script writing is also relatively poor, with cheesy jokes and cringe worthy lines. I get that this is a kids game, but that doesn't mean it has to be so low in quality. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad OST, bad story, bad graphics, tons of glitches, annoying voice acting makes this one of the worst games; if not the worst game in general; of 2014. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't think this game is all terrible, I admit at times it was kinda fun to play, but in the end there is just too much bad there. Firstly it is rather broken game with some frame rate issues, Secondly It is also easy game that also gets a bit dull as there is lack of interesting challenge and it feels very dumbed down game TBH -.-... And thirdly, it doesn't really even feel like a true sonic game at all, which as fan of franchise is very disappointing me just by itself, as game isn't really good either to help me accept this. As for being broken, for instance you can literally avoid all hits (was it enemy or some crazy spikes etc.) just by rolling continuously as that makes you apparently invisible, how does something like this even make it to game...

All in all problem is just that everything feels bit off in this game, nothing is done particularly greatly and some things have been done extremely badly. I feel they had actually good ideas here though, just that what we in the end got here wasn't those ideas implemented in game in some awesome way. Rather we got complete train wreck that will be laughed at as one of the worst games made in 2014. Even dialogue is full of unintentional comedy as jokes are so damn bad... There really isn't any reason to return on this game other than maybe try harder mode if you found game interesting enough somehow to make it to end (Personally I just couldn't make it...) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just like Sonic 06, horrible. It really is not good in any way, not even story-wise. This game isn't even cannon to sonic games, I don't know what sega was trying with this trashy game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will give this game a starting point of "2 out of 10" because I like the characterization when their lines weren't being repeated over and over. However everything from the fact combat does NOT level you up with experience (The bot parts you gain do nothing but grant you passive upgrades), the fact you can't learn new moves, the choppy horrid framerate that can't even sustain 30 fps, the rating system that LITERALLY DOES NOTHING FOR DOING BETTER IN COMBOS (Got an S rank? Doesn't do anything special at all), the fact that revisiting an area (at least in fast travel) resets all the cutscenes and dialogue spoken in that area....

This game is severely unpolished. I feel regret that I bought this and beat it in a day. I wasn't mad that I beat the game: I was actually satisfied but upon reflecting on the game I had been playing....I just didn't have a reason or wish to go back to it.

So I traded it in to GameStop towards Super Smash Bros Wii U: something I recommend everyone do if they made the mistake of buying this.

If not and you're reading these user reviews: PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. WATCH THE CARTOON INSTEAD. The cartoon actually has some talent behind it who have been working in the field and know their limits.

SEGA, it's time to just let Sonic die. Please.

This game is an absolute disappointment because of a number of things. It has a terrible framerate, it's full of bugs and glitches, it's unfinished (due to Big Red Button breaking up during the development of the game hence why it's a terrible mess) and most of all, the game is extremely dull and monotonous to play. I personally would recommend Sonic Lost World or even Sonic 06 over this abomination. For your own sake, avoid this game like the plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just to make it abundantly clear: this game isnt bad like how Sonic 06 was bad.

06 was an utterly terrible project, with awful gameplay and level designs, terrible side missions, very bad hub worlds, an abysmally stupid and just wierd story, and it was glitched and buggy as hell to boot.

Boom is glitchy and its framerate is choppy, but apart from that, it's not a terrible game. It story is stock. Its design is stock. Its visuals and music are stock. Its characterization is stock. Its combat and running sections and general platforming is stock. And by stock I really do mean stock, as in they picked every rejected or mediocre parts they didn't want to put in other games.

This is what really needs to be remembered: Boom isn't bad because it's terrible, Boom is bad because it has no soul. This game was shat out as fast as possible with no soul or any kind of creativity or love. Nothing in it has identity, is daring or specifically Sonic, it's just a stock, boring platformer with nothing for itself where the brand Sonic was put on the cover.

For the love of god, SEGA, if you want to make a Sonic spinoff, which is already stupid since after Generations was great you made Lost World which was already stock, mostly soulless and generally boring, but if you want to make a spinoff while you're already trying to secure a market for your main series, AT LEAST DONT SHOVE THE GAME IN THE HANDS OF SOME DEV WHO CLEARLY COULDNT CARE LESS AND JUST WANTED TO GET IT OVER WITH.

Another **** on Sonic's legacy, it'll live through it, but for god's sake I really hope SEGA management all commit sudoku, because this game is a disgrace to the fans, a disgrace to kids who might buy it, and a disgrace to Sonic.

I always tried to be forgiving with Sonic because underneath the ocean of terrible concepts or ideas there was always something of value. Even in 06 for all its atrociousness there was ambition and effort, even if the game was forced out while it was still an alpha because even back then, SEGA was a terrible company that understands nothing. But here there is nothing to forgive, because there is nothing under. It's a game nobody wanted to make, nobody poured ideas into, and nobody wants to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITS AWFUL THE COMBAT SUCKS THE STORY SUCKS THE CHARACTERS SUCK THE DIALOGUE SUCKS THE CONTROLS SUCK THE GRAPHICS SUCK THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS THE VISUALS SUCK THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME!

Shame on you Sega! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic literalmente hizo boom, boom boom en todos los aspectos, este juego es "EL PEOR JUEGO DE SONIC JAMAS HECHO" al principio se veía muy flojo, tuvo tiempo para que lo desarrollaran bien, pero al parecer lo hicieron a la ligera. En lugar de llamarse Sonic Boom, debería de tener como titulo "SONIC BUG" pues hay de sobra. No gasten su dinero en esto, es de los peores juegos del año y probablemente el peor juego de Wii U oficialmente. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not buy this game, even if you think its a kid's game that people treat too harshly. It has tons of glitches, slow pace and the speed parts are laggy. The graphics are bad and even worse if you want to play 2 player. The only good part is to be able to use 4 different characters. For your own sake, do not buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring ass game, horrible graphics, OST used in a cradle with glitches rivaling that of 06, this games is boring and shallow. The character interactions are good as they seem normal. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

-_-    Should I bother writing a review for this game......Well, fine. This game is complete trash. This game is **** Just no. No.........no.......no.....no.......NO.....NO...NO...NO...NO... NO NO NO NO NO! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic Boom makes Sonic '06 look like Sonic Boom.
In all honesty, this game is a mess. The constant framerate issues, the random clipping, the gross textures, bland environments, broken physics, everything just fell apart...
This is what happens when you take a game engine that's not compatible with a system, and force that system to play whatever it can. CryEnging, I'll admit makes games look good, just doesn't work with a Sonic game. Most importantly, it doesn't work on the Wii U!

The only thing I CAN praise is the acting, some of the writing, and the animations during cutscenes. This is pretty much the best acted Sonic game so far. Every character interacts with each other without making it seem dull and boring. The writing can be pretty funny at times. The animations are very very VERY fluid and cartoon-esque. It just seems natural.

So, overall, don't play this game. If you just have too, get it cheap. Do not pay over $20 for this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Damas y caballeros... Con ustedes el FLOP del año!!!
No se que decir... SEGA, creas Aliens Colonial Marines, una reverenda m*erda, haces bien en quitarlo del catalogo de Wii U, prometes compensarlo con 3 juegos, Sonic Lost World (bien), M&S en Londres (Regular) y cuando el hype por el tercer juego esta en el aire sales con esto... BOOM... así describo este juego, donde SLW se convierte una obra de arte subvalorada en exceso.

Sonic Boom: Rise of I don't Know :

PRO:
-gotta go fast
-nice meme
-ahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahaha kids save your money
-if you wanna laugh with your friend buy this game if you think it's good then I'm sorry you are wrong

CONS:
-Everything

CONCLUSION:
Sonic wasn't fast enough :| 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Still better than 06.

Don't get me wrong, this game IS arse, but it is better than Sonic 06.  I just think this is better than 06 because the storyline isn't like 06's. I do hate the redesigns though, especially Knuckles', because he was my favourite character.

And SEGA, DO NOT screw up the next Sonic game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the only sonic games sonic 3d blast I hated creators we all took what was good sonic and changed in big cow dung,
I hope that Sega does not do it again an error like this ...

There have been a lot of bad Sonic games over the years but Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric has to be near the top (or bottom? ) of that list. There is hardly anything redeeming about the game. Wii U owners looking for a Sonic fix would be better served by "Lost World" or just going back to the Wii's "Sonic Colors". Honestly, there is no reason to play this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic BOOM: Rise of Lyric is nothing to be proud of. This game has been known to be one of ,if not, the worst Wii U games. In my opinion, it is a re-mastered and glorified version of Sonic '06 for the Wii U and it is still as glitchy, laggy, broken and painful as Sonic '06. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Do not buy this game and avoid it at all costs as it will just gather dust on your shelf full of Wii U gems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst, least inspired pieces of trash to be released this year. Don't be fooled by positive impressions. Stick with the reviews and avoid this at any price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is absolutley PANTS, DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ставлю этой игре оценку 2 из 10 .  В игре очень плохая графика  , но высокие системные требования  , много багов и недоработок , ужасный мультиплеер не приятно убивать врагов . Не понимаю как 505 games смогли сделать такое говно . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had this game.

Bruce Lee didn't look lie him.

Look like Moe from The Three Stooges.

The game is okay.

But you know when you make a games.

Game is so-so, graphics are not good.

Need more action. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very poorly made game. A huge disappointment considering it is a fantastic movie. Game play is too simple and controls obviously made for console not PC. Graphics reminds me of PS1 graphics (but worse). Complete waste of money. I didn't even bother to finish it. Couldn't stand it any longer. Sorry Sega, but your game is really poor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i didnt like this game and not because of the graphics or the movement speed but because it is just so hard to hit anything in this game i wish there was at least an aming riticule or somthing that way i can tell where i am aiming at. the first mission does not even give you a tutorial it just says here u go go kill them and i bet given time i could figure out how to play this game with some efficiancy but it took me a long time to just do the first mission  but i am not a patient person when it comes to games like this i wish they would have done better that way i could enjoy it bacause this is defenatly an interesting story

Now when a game is adapted for a large amount of source material, like the Gundam franchise, you expect the game to utilizes much of said source material as possible. This allows for a great story for newcomers to the source material or nostalgia for those who have already seen it. Gundam: Crossfire on the other hand does none of that and tosses you into a story you know almost nothing about with the weakest mobile suits of the bunch. Let's see where this catastrophe went wrong.

The story of Gundam Crossfire is supposed to take place in the first series, Mobile Suit Gundam. Now instead of getting you into the great parts like the Battle of A Boa Qu or Odessa, it sets you up in battles that well didn't have much significance to the overall plot. You destroy a Zakutank here and there, but the main story is out there with the actual Gundam! You play as a soldier who is fighting up to the Battle of Odessa operation in hopes of changing the course of the war. I would care more...if you actually gave us characters to understand! This game is more or less sending you out as an unnamed soldier with no relationships. It's more like a demo for a game rather than an actual game itself.

Now don't get me started on the gameplay, this game passes off as a Gundam game purely from being in the universe. It should be called "Mobile Suit Battle Simulator" since the only Gundam you see will be further down the line. The damage aspect of the game is actually well thought out and actually pays homage to the source material. Your radar diminishes the more your head is damaged, if your arms get damaged your weapons start going, walking speed goes with the legs and the Mobile Suit gets destroyed once the torso gets too much damage. I love this part and would like to see it imputed in other Gundam games. The problem with this one is the combat, the mobility is off at times and the aiming itself can be a little too precise. The AIs literally sit there and take punishment. There is more damage done to at higher difficulties but the problem is that the AI doesn't get smarter. I don't want the game to take forever and the AI to just not care. You are allowed to recruit people, and sometimes even some from the actual story. Sadly this customization aspect was not given too much thought like most of the game and takes a backseat for most of the time. I'm done ranting about everything wrong with the gameplay.

The sound is almost non-apparent and the graphics are actually the only thing I love about this game. It looks damn good, the Mobile Suits look good while moving and shooting. Other than that the terrain is nothing special and only some Mobile Suits have more detail put in. All in all the asthetics of the game are really the only thing to truly look at.

When you look at the Mobile Suit GUNDAM universe, you don't look at a GM and say "I want to pilot that one!". You look at the GUNDAM and say "Dear god let me pilot that!". I'm disappointed that this was a launch title for the PS3. I guess it would make sense if they rushed it all to fit it in since you can actually see ideas forming here and there. It's just not enough to make a decent game. Would I replay this game? I'm just holding onto it until I have children then tell them never to play games like this pile of crap. It'll show them standards for gaming and for that I applaud Namco Bandai.

Story: 1
Gameplay: 1.1
Sound: 1
Graphics: 3.1
Overall: 1.5 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has absolutely the worst single player shooter I can ever remember playing. The fact that I even finished the missions is a testament to my own stubborn bloody mindedness. This is an utterly awful game and I'm ashamed of myself for even playing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a buggy horrible mess!

The 1 hour long campaign lacking a story line bored me to death.

Nearly unplayable due to massive look acceleration.

Nauseatingly low FOV.

Random crashes.

Can only play multiplayer if you have a NAT type 2 Internet connection.

FPS Issues.

Good

The create a class system is just the same.

Has kill streaks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i just don't understand how Activision could fund such a disasters. Bugs and  everywhere. players getting stuck on a door, a respawn point puts you behind enemy lines. controls don't feel good just yuck 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've long since lost love with the Call of Duty franchise, but even by my own checked expectations this is absolutely diabolical. It's an absolute unflattering slap to the face of anyone who purchased the Vita in confidence of developer's taking it seriously. Nihilistic have appropriately closed their doors and sworn off ever developing for retail again, as they should. This is an absolute joke, the Vita is more than capable of delivering something worth standing alongside the rest of the franchise and deserved much better than this pathetic effort. Looks dates, feels dated and the absolute absence of character or identity makes Declassified feel like one of those pointless mobile download games. Nothing but a name and a couple of, barely, recognisable pixel collections. I seriously can't believe this piece of **** managed to slip on to the market. How didn't ANYONE at Nihilistic realise - oh forget it. Just avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game. Only given good reviews by people desperate to justify spending their money on this bomb. Save your money and go and buy something else, ANYTHING else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a shame. The game is incredibly unimpressive given the system it's on license it is supposed to represent. I find it astonishing that users here rate games like halo 4 and black ops 2 down, but put all their support behind this unfinished turd in alpha state. Nihilistic changed its name during development, I suspect it's to avoid any connection with this game in the future. Resistance burning skies was actually better than this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the biggest **** for a PS Vita owner. What I expected was a action packed single player like the other CoD games. Instead, this game is meant for multiplayer, and multiplayer only. I DONT WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER ON A HANDHELD!!! Because it's crap and i don't want an online experience. I want to play a thrilling single player with lots of explosions and **** Nothing thrilling on this. Buy Resistance Burning Skies instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified is a total nonsense game that relies only on the name of the franchise to offer an unfinished product with numerous errors. A title totally expendable and it adds nothing to the catalog of Vita. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have got to average this score out. this game is BLAH!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Au bout d'un an de patches (!), le jeu est plutôt jouable, stable mais encore buggué quoique qu'on ne sache pas si c'est en raison des mécaniques de jeu périmenazes et absconses ou simplement de purs vrais bugs résultant de l'incompétence notoire d'Egosoft qui fait pourtant le même simulateur spatial pourri depuis des années. Les deux sans doute.

L'interface au pad 360 est bizarre mais presque correcte tout comme les menus à  la fois laids et peu pratiques. En vérité, rien n'est vraiment "pratique" dans un X, tout est pensé en dépit du bon sens. Le commerce est incroyablement lourd à gérer, même l'exploitation minière est un pensum. Les combats sont moyens, on est loin des vieux standards de référence (des années 90 !) en la matière !

Techniquement parlant, c'est toujours aussi joli (mais diablement exigeant... l'optimisation est clairement absente) sauf les personnages horriblement modélisés, un massacre ! X Rebirth est tout en français avec un doublage plutôt correct. Dommage que ça n'aide pas vraiment à jouer ce jeu kafkaïen. Je n'ai pas le temps (à perdre) pour circonvenir les limitations bordéliques d'un jeu programmé par la même bande d'incapables depuis des décennies. Egosoft, vous êtes des clowns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fistly: im not the "its bad because they changed it" kind of fan. I was really looking forward to this game because I liked the changes they planned (faster game focused on new players. More accessible but still complex). So far Im very dissapointed. Controls are not intuitive and very slow (most of the stuff is done by talking to npcs. This will get old very quickly. And then looking for new captain will just slow you down). And the game is buggy too much. Keeps crashing (great combination with no autosave). And there are mission breaking bugs. Me with many other players am not able to finish even the tutorial. Stuck on energy cells mission. Until there is some serious patch or two, avoid this game. It is Simcity all over againn 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After six months of patching and fixing it will be something like Edge Of Chaos or Freelancer. But of course not a sequel of X Universe.
Everything is broken for now. And most saddest thing is that game is broken because of poor design decision. This cannot be fixed by patches. I think it will be fixed in future DLCs, for a ammount of money of course. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An alpha or beta game at best, your ship has been stripped of almost all it's former features and I hope you like the ship you start with...because that's it it's all you're going to fly.

All the more strategic elements of the x universe are now nested behind unhelpful and repetitive menus.

Highly disappointing please I urge you reader not to reward this kind of release, don't buy until it's on sale if you can wait...If not at least give it a few weeks to see if any real support will be given. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

7years and they come with this?
This game isn't even worth a  in depth review,i played they other x3 series wich are far better than this piece of..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played in excess of 12 hours since the launch... the more I play it, the more angry I get. I cannot believe I wasted my hard earned money on such a disappointment of a game! I was excited that a faster pace, easier to use interface was going to be created in this new X, but there is so much missing from the other series.... The bugs are everywhere... There are repeats, music, characters on all docks... you can only get one pilotable ship!! which sucks... and cannot switch it. The missions, specially the escort missions, the ships are stupid and get stuck, or don't move... The game is unfinished, unpolished and purely a waste of money. If I could get my money back, I would! Egosoft, you really did us in this time! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here are some impressions after just 16 hours of play:

The Good:
Flying around space feels great and looks great.
Combat is good, and weapons pack a decent punch.
Sound assets and music are of high quality.

The bad:
- One plot mission requires players to edit scripts within their steam directory in order for it to activate.  For a full price release this is unacceptable and gamebreaking.
- Bugs, glitches, and crashes.  In every plot mission.
- Poorly implemented gameplay elements have caused players to have to reload plot missions  for example  one mission requires the player to take control of a 'hacker drone' forcing them to relinquish control of the main ship during a heated battle.  This results in the player's ship getting shot at (while the player instead controls the drone), and then the ship gets destroyed, forcing a 'game over'.
- Dialog is very repetitive and there are already mods that have been released specifically to remove the amount of repetition there is.
- Lack of laser and missile types.
- NPC models are ugly and assets are heavily re-used.  NPCs also perform squats while talking to them.
- Locating a merchant of a particular type (eg. drone merchant) is impossible as there is no station information anywhere to provide their location.
- The player's ship can get attacked while it is docked at stations.
- The player's ship can get attacked and destroyed during cutscenes.

Overall:
Post patch this game could achieve a 7. As it stands, broken plot missions and the requirement for editing the script files of the steam directory will infuriate players and push them away from what could be a good game.

Players who do not understand Javascript and computer programming, or who do not wish to engage in this to make the game function properly  look elsewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm deeply disappointed in Egosoft and Deep Silver. They are both two companies I look up to and I've waited since the beginning of 2013 for the release of this "masterpiece". Surprisingly, the sequel is nothing compared to its predecessors and I'm left with no words to describe the fall of a great franchise. This game had huge potential, but something went very wrong. Adjusting the series to new players is a good thought, but the result is a complete betrayal to the loyal community and all the fans.

I want to praise them for exploring a new concept with in-door exploration, but using the same environments repeated times won't keep the players around for a long time. There is also a huge imbalance in the graphics, where the universe is a lovable eye candy and the rest of the game's graphics is completely outdated.

I understand that it's not easy to run a gaming company, but this is almost ridiculous. The game is nearly broken at release, and the whole sense of roleplaying is very restricted compared to the other X games in the series. So an overall summary of the game would be, broken and over ambitious. I hope this won't put a shadow over the X series, because it's one of the best space simulators ever created and also one of the best games I've played. I'm talking about X3, obviously.

I asked for a refund, without any doubt. It's the first time I've had to do that, and I hope it will be the last as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a sandbox game this is severely limited.  The interface is tedious and frustrating.  The mapping and system is useless, and the trading system is excruciating.  The graphics are nice, but  top heavy.  You have to fly everywhere.  Docking is clumsy and tedious.

They put too much effort in making it a game to be controlled by a gamepad, and stripped most of the great functionality inherent in its predecessors.

A console game in PC clothing.

My recommendation is that instead of purchasing this, purchase X2 and or X3 on steam, which are being sold for decent prices on steam.  Do not waste your time or money on this.

This should be a considered a prequel for X Beyond the Frontier. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved the X series. This one will maybe be good in 1 year after the incredible amount of bugs, ergonomy failures and functionnalities loss has been corrected. For now I feel abused having spent that much. have about 12h in game, with 3h reporting and reading about bugs. Frustration and deception are the words for what I feel with that to be rebirth alpha game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been a fan of the X series from X3 Reunion and its deep, matured and complex gameplay that reminded me of game from the past. See, I've been playing games since the Amstrad CPC 6128 all the way to the entire PC era. But this... this! I can't recall having seen such an atrocious release of a game ever, and I've seen a few! The debacle is of catastrophic proportion both for the users and Egosoft.

It's completely crippled with bugs, as is often the trend nowadays, but I never saw such an enormous lot of game breaking ones that prevents you to achieve missions in campaign thus stopping the game until you find the weirdest of alt-tabbing and game saves editing and what-not work-arounds.

But far more importantly, as bugs like this can be ironed out with patches, the game totally sinks from idiotic and schockingly puzzling design decisions that makes every core part of the game, like trading, station building, fleet commanding and basically the rest to be extremely tedious, very limited, obscure and generally not working at all than again due to bugs.

The UI, something the devs were saying all over the place with pride to be streamlined yet retaining all the complexity of the game, well... it is the most tedious conter-intuitive thing i've yet to experienced in a game. You to branch into countless ramifications of one category to actually access a single fonction, opposed to old X3 where every fonctions of a category was presented in a single window.

You thought X3 was hard to fathom UI wise? well X rebirth is like comparing MS-DOS vs nowadays Win7, it's this much a nonsense...

You spend countless time and basically most of your playthrough actually finding the very station that has an arms dealer, in a zone that seems like 10 X3 sectors compressed down to a massive city space station were everything is scattered and that you have to scan from back to front, making sure you discovered every little docking area, then land on every one of those where you discover they have an arms dealer on board in the hope that, after having walk on foot through the entire station corridor in an environment wich uninspired graphics from 2005 are laughable at best (they really are), you'll find the right arms dealer that also happens to sell what you're precisly searching for!!! And if he doesn't... you'll cry while you get back to your ship to repeat the entire process!

It's... just out of this world! It'll be a mess so hard to salvage that they're going to have to hardcode a lot of things from the ground up. Something that is far more complicated than just patches... Frankly, there's so much work that involves core mechanics that I have doubts they can really do something.

And this means also we'll less be able to counts on modders because such things, they're hardcoded for a big part.

In all respect, it's X3: Light Edition, and certainly not a "different and new game", the excuse that those devs have been trying to pull over lately in a shameless attempt to evade critics.

In a way, I pity them also... because they of course knew all along what massive let down of a game they were releasing, and that they were knowingly insulting their fan base to an extent I've rarely seenstrictly for the money, probably in order to recoup the catastrophic failure of a development having gone crazy and off tracks. And now the lead designer and CEO of Egosoft is doing nothing but dancing around the fanbase worries and questions, in an attempt to evade the massive ****

Sad day for the X franchise, probably the end of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been doing these types of games since Wing Commander on up. This game has the worst graphics, controls, bugs, voice acting, navigation, and outright gameplay of any PC game of this genre--ever.

I really am lost for words. Everything is wrong with this game. No patch can fix it. They released off the back of Star Citizen hype to cash out on a moth balled project from 2005 IMHO. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very shallow game compared to its predecessors. Even without the tons of bugs and glitches it's a terrible mess without a satisfying endgame. Many vital features are missing and the UI is a nightmare while too many aspects are oversimplified. A beautiful presentation (sadly unoptimized) doesn't help too much this terrible misstep. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been in the franchise since The Threat, and while it is true the old games could be a little daunting for new players, this time around they have gone too far simplifying it. How are you supposed to "manage an empire" with an Xbox controller? The thing is, you can't, even with a keyboard, because it's all marketing lines. The game has very little content and very little possibilities. There is so much to say about the flaws in this game I'd rather direct you to the Egosoft forums. Try to ignore the hate and you will find explained many of the design flaws X Rebirth suffers.

I don't care for graphics. But let me say my computer shouldn't be able to run it (Phenom II X4, HD 6670, 4GB) but it does (everything at minimum, slightly OC graphics card). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried pretty hard to like this one. I couldn't. Let's just forget about the game-breaking bugs and horrible interface for a second; I'm sure you've already heard about them. Here are some other things wrong with the game on top of the basic broken-ness.

TL;DR: Everything is broken! Nothing makes sense.

The dialogue: No one who actually speaks English seems to have been involved in this game. I understand that the Egosoft team didn't make this in the US, but this isn't Zero Wing. It's supposed to be AAA(ish). I've seen translations of Japanese porn that made more sense than some of the quest briefings.

Also, "go boil yourself" is not the correct response to "where can I buy stuff?"

The animations: This seems to be a big sore-spot for a lot of people, and they really are bad! The animations basically look like what would happen if you put me in charge of the Egosoft animators. "Yeah, looks great the way her arms roll into her chest cavity! I'm just happy to be here!" I wouldn't care so much if the guys at Egosoft hadn't stressed that this was an "immersive" game above all else. Do we have a bad interface for these "immersive" animations? Is that why the dialogue seems like it was written by aliens? This game was clearly aiming for something, but it's like someone important at Egosoft got a bad head injury somewhere along the line and no one else noticed.

The boost system and the AI: Don't get me wrong, I like the boost system...right up until I have to wait for my npc squad to catch up with me. Yeah, the AI is better than in previous installments of the X series. My ships are not always exploding at dock like they did in X3:TC, but its not enough better that they actually behave normally without supervision. And by supervision, I mean CONSTANT supervision, not the interesting "keep it on track" supervision you might want from a game. So, when I boost over to a mission, I am suddenly very alone. Fortunately the enemies seem to be slightly concussed and sort of stop fighting intermittently.

Everything else: This is just for all the other random upsetting stuff I ran into. Stuff doesn't render right. The interface tags random freighters in the traffic lanes as enemy targets for summary execution and then the AI station praises me for defending them from raiders. No auto-targeting happens when you are under attack, but when I drop out of the hyperlanes it targets random things for me. Weird glass effects. "Go boil yourself." Quests with no markers like the "collect hydrogen quest". A weird inability to give orders to trading ships not in your squad. Confusing tutorial.

There is so much more, but that's all you need to read from me. Fly safe... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The off ship parts of the game are horrendously bad, and you don't seem to be able to just avoid that entirely... but even if you could the menu and command system are also a nightmare...  add in bugs and performance issues and this games a dead duck.
Flying around in space works great, but everything else is terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played the game for 30 minutes and after that i could not look at any  flat 2d JPG pics anymore. The graphics are truly terrible, like playing a game that is a bad console port. There is no decent controller configuration, assigning button on mouse and or joystick is not done. No radar map, the interface menu structure is absolute horrible. The FOV is way to small and it is not possible to walk around the  of your own ship.  textures are terrible (cartoon).
Im back to X3 reunion and TC to start all over again. Over a half a year i will have another look at Rebirth.

The good: the factories are absolute stunning! Big, nice details. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this game really badly. I would quit in a fit of anger due to something not working properly and wasting an hour of my time. After thinking I would not play this game again, I would come back hoping it would get better. After a full 10+ hours of gameplay, it didn't get better.

I finished a mission to hijack a trade ship and got not only the trade ship,  I was also given a construction ship. Awesome! This game is finally taking a turn.

Nope. I got stuck on the next mission to use the trading ship to bring 300 food to a station. Neither of them would move. I tried to get the trade ship to repair itself with an engineer because the jump drives and engines were down (have to take down the engines in order to board it). Instead of repairing itself, it just sat there. The construction ship, which was undamaged, also. Just. Sat. There.

The two new ships that I was excited to acquire soon got destroyed  the construction ship by a passing destroyer, and the trade ship by a station's large platform cannons. All because they just sat there like morons and wouldn't move. I spent 4 or more hours re-loading and trying different things to get these ships up and running before they inevitably got destroyed again.

The mission would have to be indefinitely put on hold until the game gets fixed. I've heard this and similar reports on the Steam forums because egosoft's forums are down (probably because so many people are complaining). Having played previous X games, I was so excited to get into another in-depth space sim.

I'm sure there's depth to this game. With the shameful UI, unresponsive ships, and broken missions, good luck scratching the surface. STAY AWAY until egosoft decides that maybe 7 years of development wasn't enough. They need to do a massive overhaul to keep this from bombing further. Incredibly disappointed and angry that my money and time were stolen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played the entire X series and I have experienced issues from time to time in relation to performance and game play however, this is the first time I have been really disappointed with EGOSOFT.  I was really looking forward to a rebirth of the series and enjoying the wonders in which EGOSOFT had in store.  This game feels like....... I'm at a loss for words, I don't know if they can fix this game at this point, Such a shame, good bye EGOSOFT, it has been a good journey but now we must part ways. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

XR is a slap in the face to fans of the X series of games, which were always about building and managing an empire. Managing a single additional ship in XR is a chore, and I can't imagine using this clunky, console-adapted interface to run a fleet even 1/10 the size of what I owned in X3AP.

So much just doesn't make sense--why do we have a copilot who does little except tell Betty to shut up? Why are there unlocked crates full of goods in every station that nobody cares if I steal, like this was some 16-bit RPG? Why do I have to walk in stations at all for that matter? Have cell phones been outlawed in the XXth century?

If you're a fan of the previous X games, don't buy this game. Otherwise, don't buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not a space sim, it is an arcadey simple toy. Fun for about an hour, no real hook. If you are looking for a space sim, look somewhere else. This game is designed for a console controller, not a joystick.

The dogfighting is clunky and awkward, optimization is in the toilet lending to further clunkiness. Do not buy this game.

Marketing a game to the hardcore space sim fans, but watering down everything that makes the genre great to appeal to the console crowd is not how to keep fans or win new ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Infuriating.   Gave it four hours today, and managed to hit a bug that prevents completing the tutorial.   A quick scan of forums at egosoft and Steam found that I am far from alone.

In short, a AAA (priced) game should not have blocking bugs in the tutorial.   I'm an X series fan.   I've been a gamer for 25 years.

But, I have also been a software developer for 15 years:  This is inexcusable.

1.   At a minimum, it shows that development was crunched beyond a reasonable QA effort.
2.   It shows, at best, deeply misguided priorities.   Who cares about whiz-bang shaded info-icons on stations, WHEN THE TUTORIAL IS IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPLETE?

I won't get into the other issues well explained here:  The abysmal performance,  the bizarre and unintuitive interface,  the  that wastes 50  of the screen real estate.

If I was on a team responsible for a failure of this magnitude, I would be fired.    This is not AAA quality.

I won't buy another egosoft game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An utter disappointment of the genre. The games UI is so barren of features and hugely impractical it get's to a point where you wonder "what can I actually do?"

Commanding your ships is practically impossible, as you have no clean system of being able to order them around, without having to go through 3+ menus to do so.

The trading system is VERY dumb. You have a ship, you set it on a mission. Half the time the ship stalls and doesn't do anything, and there is currently no way to cancel the queue and restart it.

The game is also currently riddled with bugs, broken features, poor texture quality on NPCs, (e.g. eyeballs rotate in their head to look like something out of a horror movie) and many other issues, such as game crippling bugs which include those that prevent you from continuing the storyline.

I'm hugely dissapointed in Egosoft, I'm amazed how they can even sleep at night knowing that they have alienated their core audience by dumbing down the game to such a degree it's become unplayable. I sure hope there is a patch on the way, a MAJOR one, which fixes some of the key issues:

* THE MAP. OH MY GOD THE MAP.
It's extremely unintuitive and terrible to use.

* NPC texture quality
Huge differences and inconsistencies between NPCs. The co-pilot is badly textured, while others are very well textured.

* Overhaul of the trading system  at least give us the option to modify  cancel their queues!

* Performance
Achieving 20 FPS in a game that isn't that huge is unacceptable. I understand that an engine in the wild will vary greatly, but in this instance, EVERYONE, even on rigs far more powerful than mine, are achieving rubbish FPS.

Please Egosoft, for crying out loud, SAVE THIS GAME! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you've played X series before, and loved it, you will not like this one much. Everything has been simplified straight down to an FPS like game. Forget about controlling your fleet, managing your properties, and building your empire in the way you used to. Whole interface and complexity has been seriously dumbed down to fix in a console, so you can play it all with a game-pad and nothing else. Graphics and effects are mediocre, basically sprites, and cheap low resolution textures with lots of dirt, splattered on top. Animations are absolutely atrocious, with people moving like robots, from A to B, and doing nothing. Faces look like those of 80 yrs olds, with voices in their 20-ies. Conversations and ambient sounds are also repeated every minute, so you'll hear the same "there were no highways 40 yrs ago" on every corner. Also, most characters are rude, and have strangely pathetic comments towards you. Station design is one big horrible circle with few stairs, which is duplicated absolutely everywhere. Basically majority of the game is 7 years of Copy & Paste. I can't believe how it's all the same absolutely everywhere. Performance wise it's not the best, but I think this will get fixed sooner or later. The gameplay though will not be fixed much, and I think it's the beginning of the end of brilliant X story. I pre-ordered the game after seeing all the brilliant videos, and sneak-peaks, but it turned out to be all so different when actually played. It's a big failure in my opinion. Going back to play X3AP now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played for a few hours, and unfortunately that is all I can stand.  There are horrible design choices that utterly ruin the game for me.  Apparently they were going for 'immersion.'  I think what they confused this with suffocating boredom and claustrophobia.  There is no radar (seriously?!)  and the map system is infinitely worse than in previous games.  Combine this with a cluttered screen due to the overblown  view and zero ability to have an external or free look mode and you literally feel like you have no idea what is going on around you.  This completely ruins the sense of scale that I always enjoyed in previous x games.  Imagine being the vanguard of an entire fleet...well, just imagine it, cause you can't actually see it....just trust us, they're PROBABLY all still behind you.  The menu systems are a step down from previous games, the graphics don't feel like an improvement.  The world does feel more 'alive' at times but mainly because they seem to just cram everything together in tighter clusters of activity.  The highway system may seem to have some merit, but it feels like this will lead to a lack of exploration as you will inevitably stick close to them.    I won't even touch on the horrible out of ship aspects, as I wasn't expecting much and was planning on just giving them a pass as long as the core gameplay remained enjoyable.  Sadly this is not the case, and I don't see this game ever becoming something I can actually enjoy.

Its truly sad.  Although I am a long time fan of the series, I was more than ready to embrace change, especially in the name of greater immersion.  But every aspect of the game feels like its a step back in intuitiveness, accessibility and actual functionality.  Given this is a sci-fi setting, they should be looking to improve these aspects, not further cripple them.  (Again, no radar?  What are you smoking egosoft?!)

Side note, I had no performance issues to speak of, so none of my frustrations stem from bugs or glitches.  Had that been the case, I would simply wait a few weeks or months until things improved.  But with the core gameplay being what it is, the game has already been deleted.

The one positive to come from this game is that it rekindled my desire to play X3 again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a gamer from the 80's brought up on Elite I was very excited about X Rebirth and today shelled out £40 which I now wish I had given to a homeless person and watched him/her walk into an off licence and buy some spirits and then tell me to p*** off, I would have felt so much better.

This game is broken thankfully because if it actually worked properly I would see that it is probably a lot worse than it actually appears at the moment.  When I saw the NPC's I actually did spit out some tea with a spontaneous laugh, they are so bad.  The UI is so complicated when trading that you literally have no idea wtf u are doing, did I just buy something?  Checking your cargo is another joke.

How is it possible for people to make a simple game like this so utterly complex, they should all play Elite and see how it's done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played for 4 hours now and I like the atmosphere in space in x rebirth. I am also fine with the one ship like it was in X Beyond the frontier and some other design decisions they made. The framerate could be better but it's actually quite playable, at least on my system.

BUT: after about 3 hours of playing I am now stuck in the campaign. There is a mission where you have to buy and sell energy cells, but your freighter gets stuck due to a bug. This makes the game pretty much unplayable at the moment.

Other things i noticed:
its really obvious that the game is meant to be played with gamepad (menus dont work well with keyboard)
keyboard controls cant be changed at the moment
there are many issues with the voice playback 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has a tremendous amount of potential, and I can think of nothing like it other than other games in the X series.  Unfortunately, it is profoundly broken, to an extent that makes it clear that egosoft was aware that they were releasing a broken product for full price.  Basically, they were scamming their fans.  There is real potential here, egosoft was trying something novel, which is why they don't get a 0.  The product is so fatally flawed, buggy, and misguided that I will never purchase another egosoft product and I demanded my money back.  Avoid it, or pirate it if you're a die-hard, but don't give them a cent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It has elements that showed potential but falls short, the game might entertain you for a little bit but it's not worth getting and the game has a major problem with the graphics, it take time for your surroundings to appear and sometimes even longer for the characters, so my advise is to save your money for a better game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After two hours on the PC version I am sorely disappointed. Horrible performance, shoddy graphics, laughable station "instances" with characters that would seem modest by the standards of a 1998 game. While the space sim seems promising (hard to tell, every time I approach a station the framerate goes to hell), the rest of this alpha quality monstrosity is an insult  poor voice acting, find-the-loot-box mini games and a female sidekick that's cringeworthy even for those who ride the campy retro wave.
Six crashes later I'm calling it quits and consider the $50 a late taxation of the endless fun I had with the previous X games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Summary: i gave this game a 2 because well i fought the urge to give it a 0 it has a few good points but mostly bad i can look past the graphics being sub-par if it is reflected in the performance but it is NOT. below is a list of my Personal reviews about 3 hours of gameplay even when i wanted to turn it off after 1

PROS: -Space travel is much faster even if the Highways are stupid
-Can enter highways at any point not just front of the gate
- Space performance is acceptable and "OK" Graphically
- .........that's about it.

CONS:  Voice Acting.....Almost Non existent.
- Everything Menu Related is Horrible it is all Console Based (Epic Fail) and is Laggy at best even on a gaming rig, trying to tell your fleet ANYTHING game needs to be paused, Trading Windows also Fail at times textures make it impossible to see the prices that is if you can figure out how to buy/sell anything
- Can only Pilot 1 ship for the foreseeable campaign
- docking your ship is a hassle and when docked you can only access a small part of the station usually limited to the room that you docked at
- finding a specific person on a station without a nav beacon takes so much time because of the numerous docking ports on each station which you have to get Uber close to,to see who is in that room
- the Land Or Station portion of the game is Atrocious even with more than powerful enough GPU's it is choppy/laggy,  you have to be in front of a person before talking to them, again Menus are horrible and choppy, you can loot random boxes/lockers who just puts out random stuff for people to take even in games that is stupid,
-.In Previous X titles stations were Menu based and you could access the whole station from the main docking port which is as it should be without all this walking around crap it was much simpler and Faster to me the First Person Station aspect is an entirely unneeded and Broken Portion of the game Although with the menu system this game has to offer it would somehow make it worse to revert back to the old way.

All In All Steer Clear do not WASTE your money on this Pathetic excuse of a game, And EGOsoft you have just Lost at least one Loyal Fan( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What can I say? As a fan of the whole X-series I had such high expectations for this game.

What we got made me feel not only disappointed, but also ripped off. The trailers and hype highlighted the (admittedly) beautiful space scenery and combat, while hiding the broken mechanics, control system, menu layout, ridiculous script, amateur voice acting, and bad indie-game last-gen graphics when docked at a station.

Egosoft lead us to believe that we would be getting a first person experience at the level of quality we have come to expect in the series. What we got was a basic and uninspired (freelancer-esque) place where players can wander and explore the same few rooms on every damn station while trying to locate some poorly modeled and textured npc who will either offer to "show us their wares" or (if you ask for the ship dealer  which no longer exists) will simply insult you and end the conversation.

This game is a travesty, and Egosoft should be ashamed for having made it. If I thought there was any chance of getting one, I would ask for a refund. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have also been waiting for a long time for a REALISTIC IMMERSIVE space sim that actually makes you feel like you are in a believable futuristic space world. That means DEVS, There is no air in space. Which means ships have no max speed, only max acceleration and burn time.  Sure you can use ship computers to limit max speeds during combat or in certain areas.  With that being said why do ships in this game have to use these Disney like monorail highway systems.  Can't ships just travel the old fashioned way,  with the use of their own engines?  I thought the accelerator gates in the terran systems where ridiculous. This is worse.
Another very important part of a space sim is the detail and functionality of your ship. All of the parts should work and the  should be completely realistic and functional,  not what the 'skunk' has which is just simple eye candy garbage.
The final most important thing in space are something that is always forgotten.  It is what we live on, Planets.  When considering a new space sim I always ask a couple of simple questions.  First,  can I interact with planets? Like something so simple as orbiting them, or landing on them.  Egosoft has always ignored planets as with most other space sims. Except for freelancer,  which is 10 years old. I thought X rebirth might fix this.  I think not, again they are completely inaccessible pictures in the background.

Another thing I ask is when I look at that nebula in the background can I actually get there. In this game there is no real way to get there because the ships are slower than a modern day airliner.  Again just background pictures that mean nothing,  immersion breaking.
The performance issues of this game are truly bad and there is so much unrealistic space junk floating around I just get a headache.
Here Is my final prayer for a distant wish, or dream of a realistic, believable space sim, not Mario brothers in space for a console. Please please Star Citizen save me!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very cool idea, but it runs like a 1 legged dog.  Despite having more than the recommended specs, and a very clean machine which is up to date and all that, the opening scene ran at 15 fps, shooting up to 60, then back down to around 20.

Despite the performance issues, the game looks massive and open.  Dock on stations, get out of your ship, walk around the hanger and then take a stroll through the station.  It is very impressive.

However due to the performance issues I cannot give a high score as of now.  The game really is unplayable at 10-15 fps in fights on a machine that handles most current games superbly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay.  It is buggy.  Bugs can be fixed, so if you wait a couple of months you'll be better off than the release day victims.  Fine.

Okay  this isn't like one of the other "X" games.  Fine.  It should have a different title, but that is a marketing thing  I get it.

What is really incomprehensible is that the game doesn't even have basic functions like "target nearest enemy", any sort of situational awareness tool, no way to scroll through contacts, intentional delays in menus to slow you down... just horrific design decisions.

For hours at a time, you'll be stealing things out of boxes and crates  nobody cares  and selling the contents to the guy standing next to you as you do it.

This looks more like an attempt to sabotage a great series than any serious effort at making a decent game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've waited for this game for 3 years. It is such a disappointment. First, they had a horrible advertising campaign. They had us believe that it would come out in 2012. Then for a year, they were completely silent, with occasional videos of how they work in GERMAN language. Such a treat for devoted fans. So it was postponed to 2013, and frankly two months ago, everyone believed that it would be postponed to 2014, which it really should have, because the game in its current state is abysmal.

And how ironic  Deep Silver would go out of their way to convince us that they've put all into real life imitation for the maximal immersion, and it happened to be the game's capital offense! Immersion my ass. There are literally one single head model per male and female NPCs in the entire game. Half the time I can't even tell them apart. They are all 60-year-old-short-hair grandmas and grandpas. Not to mention the voice-overs. Oh those voice-overs! It's like the actors are literally reading from the script for the fist time in their lives. Same goes for your co-pilot. One person who is supposed to make your journey fun, kills it with her robotic voice. I want to find out who the actress is and send her an angry letter.
All stations look alike on the inside inside, all ships look alike on the outside....

They tried their best make travel more fast and fun, but it's all the same. I still have to wait 2-3 minutes while I run by those highways. That actually is pretty realistic, now that I think of it. Anyone has to drive to work for 40 min everyday here? Yeah, there's your immersion fellas.

Bugs. I haven't had too many of those, thankfully, but I did have a nasty one that pretty much ruined my tutorial part of the campaign, because I did exactly as the window script told me to do. Anyone had that crap with the delivery of energy cells? I know for a fact that a lot of people did, I checked.

And of course there is this stupid  design that blocks 50% of your view, thus making one of the most important parts of the game  beautiful view  inaccessible. Why do I need all this crap getting in my way? I want to see the stars. And then again my idiotic co-pilot tells my AI to shut up all the time. What's her problem?....

At least it's a good thing, they've allowed modding right of the bat. May be some good people will turn this thing around. But it is not the modders' job to fix a broken game. And there is only so much you can mode. The terrible voice-overs are not going anywhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I finally registered for Metacritic today just so that I could weigh in on this atrocious launch.  I've been a huge fan of the X series for years.  I've logged over 320 hours in X3TC alone.  I'm running a solid rig  i7 quad core, 16 GB ram, Nvidia GTX 780.

While I haven't encountered the frame rate issues many have, I have run into a myriad of others.  Corrupt save games, getting stuck in the clipping when on stations(which is easily the least enjoyable part of the gameplay experience), and buggy missions.  Most recently my ship UI just randomly decided to disappear preventing any further progress on that save as I could not use it to issue commands to my trade ship.  How a game does not have an autosave feature in 2013 continues to baffle me.

As many have stated, the character animations are atrocious.  Conversation options are drab and feel forced.  Egosoft's attempt to add immersion only serves to break immersion for me.  The copilot(who you're stuck with) drones on with repeated comments that seem to loop every few minutes.  I wish I could seal off my half of the cabin and jettison her out the airlock.

The only redeeming factor is that space is gorgeous and flying itself is a joy once you get used to the keyboard commands(which are very similar to the default key commands from x3tc).  Unfortunately the keyboard commands are not mapable(whuuuuut?!)

Lack of proper joystick support is also inconceivable to me, considering this is a space sim.

In it's current state, I can only caution potential buyers to keep their wallets put away for now.  With a few months of patches and hopefully a release of the modding tools, we may have another great game from Egosoft.  As it stands right now, X Rebirth is a steaming pile of dung. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bought on Steam, can't get a refund.

So lets see,

The map system is terrible, it makes no sense whatsoever.

The  view is the only view, I'd rather a seamless view with some HUD elements. At least an option to switch between them would be nice.

Mission targets/waypoints sometimes vanish for no reason, and you're left not knowing what to do.

Docking system is terrible and unrealistic, spoiling immersion,especially when taking off again.

Don't expect to be able to upgrade your own personal ship, or buy/build lots of new ones you're stuck with the same one, and can only get other ships to join you're fleet and follow you.

Walking around on stations is completely unintuitive and feels like a game made 20yrs ago.

NPC dialogue is a chore, and spoils immersion.

Frame rates can drop for no reason, and requires a reload even with a good pc.

Not even gonna mention the vast array of bugs.

So I'm completely saddened and disappointed in this game, I love space/trading sims etc and I expected this to at least be as good as X3 and much better, instead it's the opposite.

A cross between Eve Online (without PvP) and a better X3 would've been my ideal game of choice. Too much to hope for I guess.

All in all I feel cheated, and I can not even get a refund. Won't be trusting Egosoft ever, ever again, sorry their reputation is now ruined. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My initial review was a 5. It was mainly due to poor performance/graphics ratio. In any case. the graphics look like they are from 2006 (except space). Space in this game is awesome though and it is probably the only thing that keeps me interested. But here are objective bad parts of the game:
1. Why is there only one (maybe two) types of female npcs? Moreover its an old hag with saggy boobs who is in tights and speaks in a young schoolgirl voice...wtf? Whenever they try to put some glasses or hats on any of the npcs, they look crooked and out of place...cmon. Moreover, NPCs just stand in stations and ships like statues, not doing anything...immersion breaker.
2. The stations are all pretty much the same (found 3 varieties one of which is the inside of a ship u dock into). The loot that you might find on the stations is always the same and in the same location. Finding anybody in the station feels like a choir and doesn't add anything towards immersion.
3. Poor UI, very poor. Kill it with a spade, stab it in the brain, get rid of it...makes me want to cry.
4. Your companion is annoying...her "Shut up Betty" needs to stop. She needs to be vented out of the ship.
5. The MAP! Just look at this blinking horrible zone/sector/galaxy...ugh...cant call it a map.
6. Bugs. Many of them. I couldn't complete the tutorial when i had to buy and sell some energy cells. At least in X3 AP if NPCs cant do it, you can do it for them. Here though, you cannot do it any other way but through an NPC and when its bugged....cant complete mission.
7. No proper controller support.

Warning: (Tears incoming).
I want to like this game...i really want to, I still cannot believe we all got ripped off so hard. I feel cheated and if i had a chance i would have refunded my game...I would not recommend it to anyone ever and egosoft...I lost all the respect i had for you. Never ever ever i will buy a game from you.
(Tears Over).
Guys, I know i told you to wait for the patches and get it when its on sale...but, now I got to say stay away from it entirely. Do not buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buggy and filled with performance issues upon release, but that's not really the worst part.  While I do appreciate the revamping of caps and trying to add further immersion, the base concept is flawed.  For one, if you're going to make stations, least do them proper, create decent models for npcs and actually give them useful dialogue otherwise you're just creating a terrible feature that does nothing but waste time that could be spent actually playing the game.  Two, here's a biggy, if you're going to give people capital ships, DON'T FORCE THEM TO WATCH IT FROM A FREAKING LITTLE RING IN THE DOCKING BAY.  If you're really can't handle making a generic capital ship bridge interior where we can actually get readouts on what's going on and be able to look out from the bridge instead of a little window with a 45 degree FOV, least give us 3rd person view.  Sitting in a tiny little ring in the docking bay with a 45 FOV window with no information on what's going on is pointless.

-That being said, you can't really use directly control anything else other than the skunk, which wouldn't be as bad if it weren't for the aforementioned.
-Gone is the intricate single menu where you could control the entire world, in it's place are even worse menus that require you to take a 6 sec animation to actually get any useful reading plus founding through even worse menus.
-Did I mention for a space sim generally about getting new ships, you're stuck in a single ship?

Fundamentally, the game's broken, even asides from the bugs and the performance issues, the base game's broken.  Less they actually bother changing that or some mod does, the game's essentially unenjoyable if you plan doing more than fly around the galaxy in first person in a single ship.  Only reason you're even getting a 2 is because yes the game does look decent and battles in theory should be enjoyable if it weren't for the fact that they're not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is shameful. I have played the X series since X2 and this is NOT an X game.  The user interface is terrible, shockingly bad. The textures and graphical fidelity is something you would expect from 5 years ago. The performance is dire considering how bad it looks. The game is not stable at all with regular freezes and crashes. The highway system sucks and the map/info windows are so obtuse they feel like a hinderance.

Egosoft what are you doing? I feel this had so much potential but you fell very short, it is full of great ideas and I really wished it was the game you wanted it to be but it isn't.

Don't waste anymore time or money on this, give up, there is too much too fix, I cannot imagine this ever being close to what it should have been. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played all the X games, and love how deep they are. Building galactic empires, engaging in huge trades, dog fights, capital fleet fights. It is all wonderful (and the graphics were good for the time when they came out).

I have a Gaming PC which plays BF4 without a hitch, but this game kills my system with graphics not on the same tier as BF.

Now, I can't really say too much about the gameplay as I can't play for long with 20fps but here are my first thoughts:
- cool I can walk in stations, but it seems more like a chore and it's not very alive. I was hoping for a mass effect atmosphere.
- the stations do look awesome and are huge.
- The UI stinks. But the UI typically does in all x games. I found it difficult to navigate the maps though, and that was one thing which was easy in x3.
- Hiring crew is cool.
- ONLY ONE SHIP?!?! X has always lured me in by allowing me to try all the different ships, have a bunch parked at my HQ and get to have completely different game experiences based on which ship I'm in.
- The highway system is stupid. Ill take Seta and jumpdrive thanks.

But alas, maybe if I could properly enjoy the game without the eyestrain I could understand the dramatic changes in design. I have been waiting years for this game, this is the most disappointed about a game release since Dragon Age 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whether you approach the game as a veteran X player or a new space sim enthusiast, you'll be sorely disappointed. The game's positives are massively overshadowed by countless throwbacks to an ancient generation of computer gaming, bugs and misguided attempts to emulate recent commercial successes. If you are ready to stomach 2004-level animations and frustrating design choices just to get your hands on a twitch-based space sim, you'll be much better off with an actual 2004 game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had to change my review now that I've played the game a bit more. I was originally optimistic and thought I could see around some of the problems and give the developers the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately I have now come to realize now that this game is a complete disaster. Avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

4 in graphics
0 in interface
2 in gameplay systems

you will spend more time waiting for a ship to deliver/receive goods than doing anything else, oh and walking inside stations looking for some dude

poor game overall, x3 was way much better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am an X veteran, been playing since X3:Reunion. I have put more time into this series than any other game. So far, for Rebirth (or Stillbirth, if you prefer), I have put 18 hours into this game.

Right now, this game is pretty bad. Here are some of my main gripes:

1) Trade is broken. Your freighters cannot handle multiple trade orders, they will get confused. Even with just one order and with babysitting, they will get confused and freeze up. When they do dock, they will often freeze and the cargo drones won't do anything. I made the mistake of saving and restarting X Rebirth, but upon loading, all of the wares I was trying to sell were missing, and I didn't have any credits from the sale.

2) Repairing squad ships is broken. You can find a Ship Dealer and tell him to repair one of your ships. One of my ships was at 85% hull, and I was charged 1.5 million for the repair (even though the ship only cost 5.5 million brand new). But when the repairs were "complete", the ship still had the same hull damage, and I had still been charged 1.5 million credits.

3) Squad ships will disappear sometimes. I was on a station, and tried to add a Construction Ship (plot) to my squad. The ship simply disappeared. It was not in combat. Nothing funny was going on near it. The ship just *poof* up and was gone.

4) The plot has major bugs in it. Game breaking  game halting bugs. Even 'smaller' bugs are supremely annoying, such as your ships not being returned to you after a plot mission.

5) NPC models are fugly. When I first saw the co-pilot, I had to laugh, because she really looks like a dog. Lucky for her, the rest of the NPCs on the stations look even worse. And their dialogues are annoying to say the least. There is no way to skip the dialogues, when you're trying to run away from the NPC out of disgust, you are locked in place until they finish talking.

6) The universe is NOT alive. Not even going into the NPCs, the ships that fly around the stations just snail around in circles. The highways and superhighways have the dumbest mini-game ever (where everyone is faster than you), and the ships in the lanes aren't even "real"  they exist only in the highways, and do not exit with you.

7) You do not have direct control over your own ships. You can't tell them to move to different locations.

8) The  takes up 50% of your screen. For a game who's strenghs lie in space visuals, having 50% of the screen covered up is pretty lame. Not to mention, it blocks visibility in tactical situations, such as dog fighting. And even in combat, there is no button to target the nearest enemy, which can get severely confusing. And the target icons that are on the border of the screen will disappear when they get near corners. They were hard enough to see in the first place, being so small and having no contrast, having them disappear is adding insult to injury.

There are a plethora of other annoyances, I promise you that there is no screen in this game where I cannot point out design flaws or bugs.  If you are considering buying this game right now, DON'T. Stop, put a pin in it, wait for Star Citizen, whatever.

But, that said, you might want to check back in a year or two. Egosoft has a history of releasing games in an unfinished state, and I have no doubt that they will be releasing patches to improve this game drastically over the next few years. I am still worried, however, that there are inherent flaws in the design of this game that cannot be overcome. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Base standard for my review... FIX IT, FAST!.
I've played a lot of buggy games in my time, and I didn't think a early release (Actual) would be worse than Sword of the Stars II which was a pretty bad early release, those of you who have played and know what I am talking about will get the idea, but its worse in X Rebirth, a lot of the control systems are buggered, no joystick support unless I use Pi, damn near a crash bug every 15  20 minutes, a lot of graphical command problems where you'll see twitching or fizzling in the graphics and I am not talking about combat. (And before anyone tells me otherwise, all my graphics drivers are up to date, my directX is upto date, my Sound is upto Date, and yes my C++ Redistributables are current with 2008, 2005 effectively as well). I would recommend this game after a stern redevelopment point kinda like what CDProjectks and Kerberus do when they say: Enhanced Edition. Because this has 1.2.1 Worth of patches written all over it, and its only 1.0.0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played for about 2 hours now and these are my initial impressions.

Game play is clunky and designed for Xbox and PS3 and has been just dumped on the PC making things very problematic if you do not have a controller. Mouse and keyboard are poor second place to a controller.

Graphics are for a PC title very poor. Characters are badly animated and have more polygons than you would expect given the year. 5 years ago these graphics would be acceptable today not. Space and ships look OK at a distance but close up you can see the lack of textures.

Given the poor graphics even with a top of the range PC the performance is poor with numerous random pauses and slow downs.

Story line is like something written by a child of 10 and less said about the voice "acting" the better. The opening part of the story is clearly the tutorial which is a great idea. Sadly the guidance on what you need to do is most of the time hard to decipher and at times very unclear.

Overall I would honestly like my money back. Was a huge fan of the earlier X titles but this is a poor relation indeed. Paying £10 for this would make the score maybe 6/10 but for the amount of money being charged 2 is a fair score.

Stay clear unless you are a huge huge fan of space trading and even then think hard before spending your hard earned cash 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfinished game, initially designed and developed for consoles, but for some reason they changed their mind somewhere halfway through the development and decided to make a PC game.

Literally every aspect of the game is dumbed down or simply cut out from the X3 series. There are a lot of plot-breaking bugs. The interface is terrible and even some extremely basic features are missing (fleet command being dumbed down to "follow me" command that cannot be even undone). The entire walking in stations part looks as if it was made in 2000 and it's not only ugly, but also makes a lot of simple tasks a chore.

The two positive things about the game as it stands now are the graphics (as long as you don't leave your ship) and space combat. That is, assuming you can actually enjoy this part which is pretty random with the nonexistent optimizations and generally a lot of people reporting 10-20 fps on fairly high end machines (or at least, way above what the developers recommended, think of i7  GTX780).

Generally, while the plot-breaking bugs can (and most likely will) be solved, I'm afraid that the number of horrible design choices cannot be recovered from in predictable future.

X3 fans should really stick with X3TC/AP. It would take years for XR to come anywhere near the complexity of modded X3TC (eg. xTended). In its current state it's hard to recommend this game to anyone, at least wait until they fix the plot-breaking bugs and the price drops to $20. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i7-4770K  4.5Ghz
16GB RAM  2600Mhz
GTX780 SLI
Less than 40FPS at max settings.

Poorly optimised and rushed to release. Advertised as an X game and is clearly not an X game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The performance of this game is terrible while the graphics are horrible. I'll wait for a couple of patches before I retry this game. I am a tad disappointed... other games run just fine but this game, even on it's lowest settings, is very, very sluggish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To start this is a title that was intended on bringing new life to the community for which I was a part of since 2003.  X was a very hard game to play and took many months to master.  X Rebirth was promised to fix this by creating a X for dummies which intended on adding features like first person on bases and an easier GUI for the player and easier control for your owned assets.
instead its a mixture of horrible bugs, unplayable storyline, and impossible sandbox mode.  I bought this game on Steam based on the 10 years of great community history with the company and overall satisfaction with the previous version.
I gave this game 20 hours of wanting to really like it.  It has bugs from factions, to graphic issues to crashes with most of the video settings.   Its far short of easy to play, even for the season players because they changed everything behind the mechanics of the game.
If you like looting on bases and picking u crates and opening lockers then you might like this game.
Today on the forums they are asking the community which bugs they should address first.
sad fact is all the new players drawing to X by pre-purchasing Rebirth are left unhappy and asking for refunds (of which they will never see).  I deleted my account on their forums and this puts an end to any support I ever had for this company in the 10 years of support they got from me.. including beta testing.
I would not buy this product for least a year based on my experience with other X titles.
Game over for me Ego..  Sorrry.  You made me look like an idiot recommending this game to my friends and ripped me off 50 bucks for trusting you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where is the game they advertised?  How do I buy that game instead of the game I have now?  Total disappointment, the X3 name has been ruined by this release.   Shelving this and will wait for patches, going back to the previous versions of X3 for now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A console port in the making. Way to support the PC demographic that has supported and fixed your games for 15 yrs, Egosoft. this game should be refunded to people who pre-ordered, and it should be sold at $30 for full price. This is a complete joke on the fanbase. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

lol... its so bad you have to laugh after paying £40 to play it.. they kept it secret and only showed certain for a reason and now we know why. Stay clear at all cost. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not X
It's a total disappointment. All features that make X Universe solid are cut out or oversimplified. When X3TC was true sandbox, where you could do whatever you want whenever you want, this is just scripted rail-straight stuff, just like singleplayer campaign in CoD.
Horrible optimization and bunch of bugs. Needs some serious patching.
Better stick with Terran Conflict, which is more playable then this 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DO NOT BUY! it looks likes its made for console  and game play feels that way also.   Joysticks do not work  Graphics are horrible  even on a 770  very buggy  does not live up to all the promised the devs made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would love to give the game a higher score. But some of the design choices just don't manage to grab me. For example: Stations are plastered with npcs. But they look really awkward and sometimes miss animations. Also some look like they're supposed to be holding something but dont. It would be a minor complaint if they werent EVERYWHERE completly runiing the atmosphere. Another point of critique is the very bad performance. I have a rather decent pc and even for me the framerate jitters a lot, depending on the direction i currently look at. Very annoying in combat. The campaign  as far as i plaid it  is not very good. More like a tutorial coming directly from the developers instead from an story writer. It's mostly really awkward and somehwat childish. But well, i didnt buy X for the campaign so forget it. Overall, it's still a good X game but by far not the "rebirth" i was hoping for. It mostly seems like the budget was going into make things fancy then really thining things trough and maybe find new approaches. The new approaches they did   like the higway minigames  just don't seem very well-tought. I dunno... i just can't get warm with X: Rebirth. Still a O.K. game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not ready to be on the market. It's as if they didn't even bother testing it but on a single specific machine. Tons of glitches, horrible frame-rates with even the best hardware on the market. And the textures, and character models remind hail back to the early 2000s. This game is not a finished product, and there is no way to believe they didn't know that.
They have taken us for a ride, and we fell for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a game that took 7 years to be developed, it's a complete disappointment. Freelancer was released in 2003 and it's probably the best space sim ever, simple and with great graphics, storyline, music and a huge universe to explore.
X Rebirth is insanely complex, even the smartest player would find it difficult to perform the simplest tasks. The fighting is nice but only 1 weapon and missile can be used at a time????
Requiring at least 4GB of memory and a 64Bit system is kinda dumb, the game looks pretty, but there are games that require a lot less and have better graphics.
Entering the stations is a nice concept but confusing and time consuming, even if all you want is just to repair your ship.
My overall review is in favor of the graphics, cause the rest is a failure. Huge price, bad and confusing user interface, huge amount of system requirements, system map is also difficult to read, and confusing aswell, trading should be a lot simpler.
Honestly guys, if you haven't played Freelancer, do it, since it's the best way to compare a game from 2003 and a game from 2013... I prefer the old, simple and rich in storyline games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is basically a scam. Almost every aspect of the game is broken and it's obvious that the publishers of this game knew it when they sold it at full price.

Some parts of it are absolutely beautiful such as the graphics for the universe and music, however the game is utterly unplayable.

I have no doubt that Egosoft will fix this in time, and that the community will mod this game into a playable game, however, the fact that egosoft sold it to unsuspecting buyers unfinished leaves a very sour taste in my mouth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ive played all previous X versions. I hoped that x-rebirth is a "rebirth" with better graphics gameplay and so on. But im dissapointed. The whole game is a total mess. Its so badly unfinished, its an Alpha not even a beta.

There are so many design mistakes and Bugs in this game, i cant even discribe how much went wrong. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is a joke and should have been named  X3: vaselina.

its 100 miles way from what the X series was before
if you're looking for a REAL space sim then just go for one of the previous episodes like X3: TC or AP 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is very dumbed down  the other X games where complex and not everyone's cup of tea, but this one is overly simplified and riddled with many bugs or features which are simply not working.
There are only 4 weapons in the game, even privateer had more XD

Only good thing I can say is that the graphics in space look good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know Egosoft has a long history of releasing buggy, nigh-unplayable games and then fixing them within months, and I'm sure that will happen (to some extent) with X3-Rebirth. I could live with waiting for the game to be patched, if it weren't so fundamentally lobotomized. You only have one ship (named  permanently  "The Albion Skunk"...so have fun with that), upgrades and weapons have been slashed to a fraction of X3's, automated trading has apparently been removed, jumpdrives are (as far as I can tell) gone..the list goes on, and on, and on. And what did they trade all this stuff for? Nothing. There is nothing better about this game than any of its predecessors (alright, some of the visuals are nice  too bad the framerate is terrible, even with my very-well-tricked-out machine). I was excited about being able to leave your ship, but they didn't even do that right  all you do is wander around identical space stations collecting items (which you're inexplicably allowed to just steal from crates and lockers with impunity), and talking to static, badly modeled, thoroughly uninteresting NPCs. It's actually more tedious  and certainly more time consuming  than just being able to interact with people via menus, ala X3. I really wish I could get my money back (thanks, Steam!)  I have honestly never regretted buying a game more. This, folks, is what you get when you purchase a game sight-unseen! Seriously, it was stupid of me  I usually don't buy games without reading several reviews first. The best thing I can say about X-Rebirth: at least it taught me never to make that mistake again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

absolute  i bought a full priced game and i get a beta finished game f**k you ego-soft. it is dissappointing to see a cpmpany who made false promisses and sells as most innovativ space game. sad very sad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a nice shoot 'em up or a nice arcade game, you know with sticks and buttons and everything. If you are looking for a game in which you can pilot a giant spaceship with all those functions, technical gibberish and stuff you have to try another game.  The space simulator you are looking for is at another castle. Nice graphics though but I think that's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Every game ever made has two very important simple rule: The basic controls have to feel natural. The interface do not stand between me and the game. While X-Rebirth is simulator, I can understand it just simply cannot be the case with this level of complex mechanics, but that is hardly an excuse for an unplayable game. It has some redeeming points. The AI is good, the drone handling is fine invention, less fatal crashes with other ships, and stations, and they get rid of the dangerous jumpgates, so instead they put in a highway mechanics. Many things flow better now. Still, there soo many bad design choices, with placeholder npc graphics and animations, horribly bad map system (4 layer map. Really now? 1 layer was complex enough for me like in the old days), no time acceleration for otherwise highly time consuming operations like full time trading, no (!repeatable!) in-depth tutorial for the new unintuitive interface, unless you read the 80 page manual and the list goes on and on... The game could be wonderful, but if basics feel bad no one wants to discover the very depth of your game EGOSOFT. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total failure. Looks like devs dont get, what brings X series to popularity. One ship is enough for X-series fan to say whats wrong in that game. Parody on spaceship  ugly partner, and finaly small rooms that calls "starbases" with boxes that can be looted and stupid AI personel? Fail. Epic fail. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a long time X veteran. Rebirth is nothing like previous X games at this point in time. So if you didn't like the old X games you may like this one. But if you did like the old X games you may not like this one.

I obviously do not like Rebirth as is conveyed through the score I give it. However, simply disliking the game is not the sole reason for such a low score on a game from a company I have been a fan of for years. The bugs are also not the reason for such a low score, and there are a lot of them! No, the reason I give this game such a low score is because of the dishonesty and deception from Egosoft about this game.

Several of the company's promises about the game either were not kept, or were just plain lies. The game isn't even in the same Genre as previous X games. Sure, it's in space and the lore is the same... but that is about where the similarities end. The creed of the game (trade, fight, build, think) appears to be missing 3 of the aspects. The fighting is there (easy-mode), everything else is either missing or it has been implemented so badly that it may as well be missing.

There isn't much point in going too in-depth for this review. So I'll sum it up:

If you are looking for an economic simulator with combat and fleet control that can rival the previous X games in the series, then you do NOT want this game.

If you are looking for an arcade game or a FPS shooter style game that takes place in the  of a spaceship, then this MIGHT be a game you will like. But with the amount of bugs in the game I would certainly wait for a few months before considering the purchase. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im new to the series, so dont have any knowledge of what the previous games were like, but my god this game is crap.

Huge bugs
Boring flight and fight mechanics
Confusing menus
Pointless tasks (wandering stations, flying around to find "i" points...)
Terrible tutorial so I have no idea whats going on

Seriously, £40 for this was an absolute joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a mess. Full of bugs. After the initial patches the game has improved but it is not what I've paid  50 for. I wanted to play a single player game with trading and single player possibilities, but what I've find is a game full of problems.

I just hope they are going to fix it, because the game is interesting... it's only messy, and buggy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad UI, confusing game mechanics, terrible performance with random fps spikes and drops.
I would like to take this a bit further, great NPC conversations and dialogue, NOT!

Fun sandbox, EVE single player like concept, terrible execution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been waiting for this game since it was announced. I've experienced previous "X" games from Egosoft and muddled through their releases until bugs and problems were resolved to make the games MOSTLY playable.

But this X Rebirth is an atrocity. It's clearly hobbled by some need for it to assume a console like play style to say nothing of the myriad of show stopping bugs that beset the game. Mini games??? Command wheels(instead of keyboard bindings)? A space ship that more than occasionally wants to 'upright' itself??? Just when you think you're getting somewhere or you're starting to have fun...BOOM! You hit that brick wall where your trader won't trade or your comrades (and even your own ships) won't fight leaving you to do all the dirty work (which was supposed to be the most fun). Or worse yet you have to figure out how to execute some task that's not even remotely clear in the UI and there's zero tutorial help. Go read the forums if you want to see the rest of this carcass.

Something told me to wait until January to buy this game. I've been looking so forward to it that I ignored that and got bit by Egosoft once again.

End result is that I'm not investing tons of hours into a game that's incredibly broken and released that way despite Egosoft knowing it. They HAD to have known it. I don't believe I can support Egosoft in any further ventures and cannot recommend anyone get X:Rebirth without the expectation of a broken game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not going to rehash all that is wrong with this game. My advice, wait a year then take a look. It might, just might be worth ones time with patches and mods. Right now, it's not worth my time. There are far superior games to be played at the moment! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That kind of product calls: "Game with Early access", not a "Release". This mess just cant be more than Beta. No ANY optimization, all docks & people models R awfull,  hide HALF  of the screen, AI doesnt exist  police can scan U every 30sec but YR ships can spend till 5-10minutes to do YR command or just hang in space... for ever   huge ships just fly through stations T_T  shields goes down by acceleration BUT collisions gives zero of damage, annoying dialogs with clones  same by second pilote, nochance to change a ship or even change the point of camera to get rid of  U cant scale or turn Map  rly looks like future gadget   control panel trying to say:"see U on console", highways idea looks bad  feels like journey of cristmas shlt inside the tube, & dont for get  ALL this happiness terribly laggs 20-30fps (max)  crashes pretty often. 2 houres R pretty enough to see all of that, if U'll be able to start a game on YR PC. To bad, RLY BAD! Going to Dark Side  Thx to Egosoft.
P.S. all that is REALLY SAD cos Egosoft already have all they need: exellent idea of X-Universe, great models of ships&stations (not inside   trade system, little army of true fans & alot of more. Creators just need to take all good from X3 (without useless-annoyng-random-imballanced boarding), add new models of ships&stations from Rebirth without copypaste of docks&ppl inside, add possibility of  view, large sectors with great views(what they really can) mb alittle more 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To get my overall opinion out of the way, this is an exceptionally poor attempt by egosoft.

I'm a fan of the x series of games in general but occasionally find them a bit too deep and meaningful, you can't just jump and be up and running in a couple of hours. Rebirth seems like it was designed to be that kind of title  very suspiciously so) however falls flat on its face trying to implement it.

Gone are the many, many different systems, gone are the many, many hard to find but ultimately satisfying to get right commands, gone is the ability to fly different ships. What do you gain? An extremely poorly voiced and annoying co pilot, a single ship with very limited upgrade potential, very little control over anything else you own, game breaking bugs even in the tutorial section  how can they get this wrong), very poor performance on a relatively high spec machine, about 3 different station interiors to explore....with about 5 people to talk to  lots of other annoyances.

They've pretty much manages to take everything that was attractive about the previous games and either remove or ruin it. Not sure what the development plan was is or if there was a major shift that we dont know about causing the issues but 7years to produce an unfinished game charged out at £40 a time is nothing short of scandalous.

New players will be baffled as of to why they should persevere, fans of the series will be disgusted with the changes. No amount of patching will fix this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All negative reviews sum it up. If they are so low it is to counter those fanboy 10/10 marks.

The game is in beta or post alpha stage. I would advise people to wait at least 6 months before purchasing it. Egosoft has always put much love in fixing it games post release. But here the problem dont lie only with bugs, but with design features, that were sold to us many times but arent in the game, instead we have poor design and loads of bugs.

Plague by bugs.
Trading not working.
Capital ships owned by player not fighting.
Quests stuck because of many bugs (i myself made an extensive thread sticked in the Workaround thread on official forum to give many hints on how to bypass them editing savegame so i know exactly what i'm talking about)
UI very poor compared to previous titles (takes more actions with keyboard for similar commands)
Not even a decent fleet command.
Lacking fundamentals key binding, like target next ennemy, closest and so on.
No radar.
Very poor map, cant read it correctly.
Walking in station was a good idea but it is very poorly done, you loose too much time in there.
And many more that could be said (just check all other negative reviews for anidea).

That said this game has huge potential, but i wont rate it on its potential but its current state. You probably wont be able to play it within the next month without huge issues forcing you to restart or edit your savegame, so for me its a 2/10 right now.

Egosoft lied to us selling us awsomeness in all their interviews and trailers, even untill a week before release. When they knew their game was so badly tested, unfinished (missing small ships dealers and so on). In short they deceived the fans. And i was a very lonng term fan.

Stay clear from this, and check official forum in 6 months or more to see how the game has evolved. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played this game for several hours. the sad thing is that, the longer i played this game the more bad things i found out about it. it is like they left out each good thing they had in the x3 series and replaced it with bad things.
The cockpit is blocking half of your field of view. there are thousands of bugs, menus dissapear, trading does not work properly, there are less ships, less sectors, less action, less available commands and of course less fun. The only improvement i found are the graphics.
please dont waste your time playing this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most games release with a few bugs. In the bug range from simple ants to gigantic roaches. This game has a swarm of roaches. The flying kind that lay eggs. The bugs even have bugs.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not a way to treat a hardcore open-universe space series. And not a good action either. If you're into serious space exploring sim - better try previous titles from X-series, this game is practically born dead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A botched addition to the X series of empire building/trading games that have built a devoted fan following because of the rich complexity of the games. X-Rebirth throws all that depth and complexity away in favor of a console experience that gets so many things wrong it's hard to conceive of how Egosoft thought this would work. Don't waste your money on this game until substantial patches have fixed the glaring problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game isn't ready for release! It looks nice in trailers, but they are made to look great.
I cannot use my flight-stick for this, the engine is poorly optimized, and the graphics are dated! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are you guys freaking kidding me?  Seriously?  This is seriously what you shat out in front of us?  We get ONE freaking ship as opposed to the TONS of others in the previous games and it's a tiny little, half-assed 2-roomed piece of garbage.  The animations on the characters also make Fallout 3 look like LA Noir.

Seriously guys, this is a slap in the face. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not buy this game. No amount of patching will be able to fix its inherent flaws. Wait for Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen.

Go back to X3TC  AP if you have to.

You have been warned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hey, it's more accessible than earlier X titles!
...which would be nice if it ran at more than ten frames per second on high end systems.
The performance is a bloody atrocity.  A machine that can giggle its way through Assassin's Creed IV should NOT be showstopped by this game.  It's pretty, but it's not THAT pretty, particularly at minimum bloody settings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some aspects of the game are nice. Large space stations, huge freighters and a travelling system (which is not perfect, but better than boring jump gates) are ok.

The  is a huge step down. In AP with its minimalistic hud you actually felt the space, it was very immersive, but now i feel like i'm in catterpillar tractor or something. Another sad thing is that there is only one ship to pilot now. In AP you could go and get fast Boron discoverer and or a big freighter. I miss this.

Unfortunately the commercials of X Rebirth featured only the bright sides of the game. They didn't include incredibly boring, lame-textured space station corridors (which is generally not a bad idea), and so (can't find appropriate words) awful NPCs. These badly-textured robots is a huge game breaker. I really don't want to see them, to talk to them or interact in any way. They are just creepy! Unfortunately one of these space monsters lives in my  even during free game. What's wrong with her clothes? What is this hole in the chest area of her costume for? I can only speculate that this is a trick to drive the look from her face. I'd add 2 points just for a feature of ejecting this monster queen from my ship.

So, for the space: +2, -8 for everything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My Personal Review of X-rebirth. Developers Check Ego_zac's list checking for working on fixing combat.
I bought a brand new computer that cost me 750 bucks. Then the game plus the collectors edition.
So I spent 800+ To play this. To give you an idea I own every x game except 1 and have logged hundreds of hours. Until this game came out I was running a single core because I did not need anything more powerful. Only reason I bought a new computer was to play x rebirth. So I am about as unbiased as you can get. So read my review.

A very simple thing that Ego_zac on the game discussion forums for the game on steam has not even listed in the things that egosoft is working on fixing and until they do I WILL NEVER PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN. Read on to see what my problem is with this game. WHAT I NEEED fixed

I put in 40 hours in the first 3 days. I had to CHEAT to get around the game stopping mission bugs.
I hate cheating in games. It ruins it I wanted to get around the bugs. Finish the story so I had access to all sectors and then play x-rebirth sandbox.

That was my plan.

I have little doubt that you left those bugs in the game and every time you put in a patch you fix something and take someone else out. So every time You gain the time to add the features into the game in the story so that you can complete the game.

You say that your priority is fixing the crashs. I DOUBT IT. Your game is not even complete.
You know it. I know it. Forget the reviews on metacrawler.

How do I know that the combat is not working. Simple I cheated to give myself money and I bought ships. I bought the carrier and the destroyer. The carrier should launch drones to defend itself. As well as use its turrets even if the drone combat has not been fixed at all.

I have a strong feeling that egosoft purposely has the trading buggered so people can not get far enough to see that the combat is not complete.

You get a hint of it when you get the mission to defend the heart of albions ship as they destroy a station. They just sit there. You own a trader. The turrets dont fire. I dont know maybe you have fixed it I have not played x rebirth since 2 patchs ago. Because i have asked in the general discussions and when asked them Are the turrets on your owned ships actually working.

Awnser a disgrace.

NO!!!!!!!!

One of the big things for players is simple you want your own private army. You build a station you drop off a ship to defend it. AND THE THING WONT FIRE A SINGLE turret to defend itself.

Come on EGOSOFT not having even basic combat working for your owned shipsis the WORST joke on an x game. How the hell you could release a game where the most basic gameplay. Which is ships that fight with you. Simply does not exist.

You want people playing this game. People are not listing this because this is so basic that everyone seems to be assuming you are working on it already. WELL are you. Seriously. That is the BIGGEST joke not being able to actually have ships you buy to fight with you. I'm sorry if I needed a meat shield I would load my ships with shield drones. Not something that is actually supposed to be able to defend itself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For me to rate a game 2 or less it has to have ALOT of things wrong with it.
It has to be a broken, misguided and just WTF game that I am playing. Well this is all three of those and more.
When I first learned about X Rebirth I was astonished at the trailers and gameplay I was shown, it was being called the Rebirth of Space Sims as they come back into todays modern age.
This game is a kick in the stomach to the above. Usually games with low scores are just called bandwagon jumpers, but for once I agree with most of what is being said. When I brought this game as a birthday present last year I was stoked, I was looking forward to trying this brand new game that would remind me of the old X wing games or just any space game in general, upon installing it I pressed play, but the game did not open, not only did it not open, but I received no crash message or errors, so I continued to keep pressing play and ended up racking about 10 minute's of gameplay just by pressing play. A couple of weeks later they released a patch which finally gives you a message stating about the crash and what is wrong. After spending about 2-3 hours trying all these different things to fix it I gave up, What I had was something I thought I could never play, until two months ago when I finally managed to get it to work. What did I get once I got it to work, well I got broken combat, ugly Npcs, some of the Worst Voices I have ever heard IE "Show me your wares" in a horrific voice, a got ugly indoor sections, ugly Npcs and a constant frame rate of 10-20 even though I can run most games on 60 fps like Battlefield 4 on ultra, Titan fall on ultra, crisis 3 on ultra and well you get the story, even after finally spending a hour finally getting somewhere I decide to go to sleep happy that I have finally got the game to work. The next day I wake up, have some nice breakfast, go onto my pc and launch the game, guess what happened?  A save game bug wiped my progress, so I shut the game down contact steam support and got a refund, I was too disappointed with the game I deleted it and will probably never get the game. Well I usually say what the game does right and wrong here but ill leave it to the pros and cons of this terrible game

Pro's
+ Space looks nice
+ The Ships look nice
+ Has the capabilities to be something amazing
+ Not playing the game

Cons
- Everything else
- Terrible voice acting
- Terrible graphics of both the NPC's and the indoor sections
- Broken game, terrible Frame rate
- I got it refunded (Yep that's right, it was that bad)
- Still broken in many areas

I rate this 1.5/10 but I choose two because I am nice
There is also other accounts of them lying about the game through their trailers and it is misleading and well that's it to be honest, avoid this for a few 3-4 years until Modder's do something about it, I may pick it up for $5, even though I generally do not, but I really wanted to like this game, but it may just never happen 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of the X-series, this game needs to be erased from my memory. All the things that made the previous game fun and enjoyable are gone. No more are the various ships you can fly, just the one. With the odd change to the hull and screen. While the giant stations and boarding are welcomed, it quickly becomes repetitive and the traffic space lanes are just annoying. Very disappointing and sometimes broken game from a company that had made some quality space games in the past. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun...(about 1 hour)This game SUCKS!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game looks terrible, its buggy as hell and its absolutely boring. Its a straight port of the PS2 version (hence the horrid graphics) and the same can be said about Iron Man also developed by Sega. Sega: you are coming down and I'm sad, I really enjoyed Genesis/Dreamcast games... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i bought this game thinking id like it, but $&%# no!!! i liked the graphics, this games not TOO bad, but pretty bad. the villain battles i hated, because all you do is bress buttons. those parts seemed alot like dancing sequences in dance dance revolution. i would recomend this game to suerman fans, but not for people looking for a really good kickass superhero game. two words: F**KIN TERRIBLE!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is game sounded good in previews, trailers and the original info for it, but this game is a complete disaster. The issues can even be seen in the opening scene where the voices are very bad, the character animations are amature and the scene lags. Second problems are in game, the checkpoint system is very bad and it is not fair at all. You die, your doing about 2 hours worth of gameplay... AGAIN. I would recommend burning your game system instead, at least its better then this horrible game burning your eyes out. I mean, i will rate this better IF they fix the issues with this crap title. Do a full update like what happened to Hydrophobia... Then maybe... Totally wasted 9.99. Im sorry wallet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All I will say is there is far better out there. In fact to be on the harsher side i'd say keep pressing x on your ps3 controller and you'll already have purchased yourself a better game than this. It is really a shame that this game couldn't have turned out better as it looked to be very promising and the concept was fantastic. The problem, the entire execution. Graphics: 3
Gameplay:2
Presentation:3
Lasting Appeal: 1

As a game and system collector I never wanted to buy this game. I went to a used games store and I saw the game for 50 cents.lol. That is the only time I have ever seen a game priced so low at this place. You only have 1 life and no save points and there are 99 levels (I think) So I wanted to see how far I could get, after retrying countless times, I finally started getting the hang of it.. Most of the time the AI will blow itself up. After getting to level 52 I messed up and I died. There is nothing more frustrating than dieing that far in the game. You will then get a "you lose" (or something like that) robotic voice and it sends you back to the main menu. When did Bomberman turn into a BDSM look a like game? They should of just called this game BDSM robots because this game sure does like to torture you. They tried to take a more mature route with this game and it wasn't a good idea at all. Even if you didhave save points in this game it doesn't save it. The camera doesn't work either when you are in that First person perspective mode. The game should of never been created, but I'm still glade that I bought it for 50 cents  and this will go into my vault of one of the worse games to ever be created along with superman 64,Bubsy 3d and Action 52 ( I don't have Action 52) but played the rom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What in the world? I have been tricked because I didn't pay for this.
The gameplay is terrible and I was surprised there wasn't any multiplayer.

Probably the worst transformers game ever made, stealth force does nothing right. Terrible controls, graphics, and little replayibility. I think this might actually be the biggest commercial for the toys, why, because you can't even **** transform. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is very disappointing. no co-op and no online. second rate graphics, zombie AI is very simple. the game drags on and the story is very light. the game had so much potential but it looks like it was thrown together in 6 months. this game has little depth and killing zombies has never been this boring. go out and buy the telltale game of the walking dead or left 4 dead. this game is horrible crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics would be something I'd amire... However, I can't considering the fact the game was released THIS YEAR. The tiresome gameplay, and old DOS graphics make the game feel like a parody of The Walking Dead, not just a plain licensed videogame. Games don't get much more exausting and unpolished as this one is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably not as bad as it originally seems to be, but still... Worst game you've played in a long time. Every idea is badly implemented. Technically it's laughable and it gets a "2" and not a "0-1" because of some good ideas (not their execution) and some jump scares. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An exercise in apathy, almost and mediocrity, The Walking Dead Survival Instinct fails in nearly every regard as a video game. And it sure as hell does it's damnedest to fail in the few areas where it nearly excels. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow is this a bad game. The graphics are bad, clunky gameplay/stealth mechanics, same exact places that you have to stop to if your car dies. The characters are really bad and after they got me what I needed I kicked them to the curb and left them for the walkers. There are almost no good things about this game. At least the game makes you use stealth(that is also pretty bad). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible, not fun at all. When you trigger the attacks from the military for doing to much damage they just spawn all around you and don't ever stop until you find a safe spot and just sit there for a few minutes. The gameplay feels like a chore, the weapons are unexciting, and the missions are dull. The graphics look like they could have been done on a standard xbox. The only entertaining part I found was the dialog, it can be funny at times listening to Crypto and Pox. Pass this one up, and at best give it a rental. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I received this game for free and feel I overpaid.  Here's why!
The environments are so poorly detailed I had to check again to make sure the disc said 360.
The voice acting is very annoying, the plot is non-existent, and many of the game mechanics feel incomplete.
The soundtrack and soundeffects are very poor, again feeling as if they were incomplete.
Basically the game feels rushed and incomplete.
The one positive I will give it is that I did enjoy destroying buildings and generally wreaking havoc with my UFO.  This should have been released as an arcade title for 5$ on the Xbox, absolutely not as a full game on the 360.

One of the worst games I have played on the 360 or the Xbox. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Got it for $1.49, and another copy appeared in my Steam inventory for some reason, so gave it to a friend. Below are our troubles:

He can't connect to me, I can't connect to him.
Shift+tab brings up console, not steam overlay. (who EVER maps console to tab!?)
Get in game. People walking into walls, warping and laggy. Leave.
Join another game.
Host stops server mid game. fun.png
VOIP always on, can't mute people in game, only in lobby.
No lobby chat.
No LAN support.
Maybe 4 servers on the internet list if you are lucky.
AI hear you at spawn through the floor below.
Join Versus server with friend. There is no way to start the match.
Have mouse sensitivity cranked up to max, still have to drag my mouse fully across the desk to turn 108 degrees.

This game is so borked. Sorry if you paid $15 for it. I guess you could have fun in single player if you are really... patient.

This is just a non working pile of code. How did this get approved for release on steam? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm writing this a few days after release, and this game is extremely buggy. The devs are apparently aware and working a patch, but it doesn't change the fact that this game, bugs aside, is terrible, even from a design perspective. It's completely lacking in any kind of functionality and usability that you would expect from a tactical shooter. There is no way to plan your mission, no way to familiarize yourself with the layout of the level before going in. Changing your loadout is done from the main menu, and when you choose which loadout you want for a mission, you better have a good memory because it won't tell you which one is which, except for a number. No way to change, or even see any of the options once you're playing. There's no way to take down enemies non-lethally, no way to subdue them.
The AI is absolutely horrendous. It'll run back and forth between two points, being completely indecisive about which is the better coverpoint, allowing you to kill them with ease. It'll snipe you from across the map with deadly precision, and if the enemy is not in your field of view, good luck trying to find out which direction the shot is coming from, as there are no indicators of the sort. The enemy also spawns randomly in the map, sometimes directly in front or behind you when you spawn, leading you to be killed the instant you begin the mission. There are no difficulty settings of any kind and the default seems to be on both ends of the extremes. The AI will react with lightning speed and kill you with deadly precision, or completely ignore you firing at the wall beside them.
The friendly AI is just as bad. You can change between defensive/offensive/quiet/assault rules of engagement, or have them stay where they are or follow you. That's it. You can't order them to move to a specific location, can't ask them to open a door, can't order them to flashbang a room. The only them your friendly AI serves as, is lives and meatshields.
I'm assuming this was supposed to be a multiplayer focused game, but the multiplayer hardly even works. Sometimes it won't connect to a game, other times, if you spam double-click a game enough, it works. There are no filters of any kind, and the modes that exist in singleplayer are not even present in the multiplayer lobby (Tango Hunt, Mission, Bomb Disarm). You can host a co-op mission just fine, but there doesn't seem to be any way to find them (Singleplayer can also quit on itself, telling you the "Connection to host has been lost".. What?).
Once you're actually in a game, you can't see who you're actually playing with, can't see how many are left on the opposing team, there's no way to spectate if you join a game mid-round and you just end up looking at a wall. I read that this was because they felt scoreboards were unrealistic, but it just ends up feeling like a missing feature. They could easily have implemented a scoreboard that only showed the names of the players and which team they were on, but nope. There's also a horrendous text-to-speech feature that can't be turned off (In fact, there are hardly ANY options, and no way to turn off specific graphical effects, except through a config file).
The menus themselves are also terrible. Some menus can not be quit out of by pressing "Escape", and you have to click the button that says "[Esc] Back". Sometimes it's the other way around; You can't click the back button, you HAVE to press escape. That something as simple as these menus are, are not working properly and consistently is baffling. The loadout menu is also completely unintuitive. To actually save a loadout you have to manually press "Y" to "Modify", even though you're actually saving it. Why not make it clearer what you have to do? If they had made the loadout part of the mission selection, it would have been less of a problem as you'd just select your weapons directly; You wouldn't have to remember them.
Every old school tactical shooter that Takedown tries to emulate, such as Rainbow Six, SWAT 3/4 and the first Ghost Recon, is better in every single respect. For a minute, it had me doubting, if my memory of old-school shooters were somehow better than what the actual games were like. I installed Raven Shield, just to see if I was wrong, and thankfully, I was. It's not the genre that's broken, it's just this game. It feels completely empty and devoid of features, and as a Kickstarter game (I didn't back Takedown, personally), I can't help but feel bad for those who backed it. This game is a massive disappointment.
Time to replay SWAT 4 and wash away the taste Takedown: Red Sabre left. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First thoughts: This game feels like an unfinished product. There is no story you are trying to follow or campaign mode. They just throw you into a map and tell you your objectives. The game is difficult (which is good) as the AI behave like hackers from Call of Duty, rubber banding to where you are and rarely missing. The graphics are pretty bad and there are some standard features missing which need to be implemented. The one that stands out most is I would really like to make a private server for friends. There are plenty of bugs that should have been fixed before release. I give it a 2 because I do like the difficulty of the game and the fact that you don't regen life, you don't have a map, you can't tell when you get a kill sometimes. The cons just outweigh the pros too much to be a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The games creators tout this title as a spiritual successor to SWAT4 and R6 Raven Shield, both games of which I am massively fond of, although to even start to compare Takedown to either of those games is a bit optimistic. Using those games as a benchmark I gave this game a rating of 2.

Sound just doesn't sound real. There isn't a feeling of immersion, especially when you get shot at.

Graphics aren't special, and looks more like something from 5 years ago.

AI teammates in single player don’t do anything useful.

Moving slow, dying in 2 hits and leaning aren't the only things that make up a tactical shooter. There seem to be a few things like reload animation jumps magically to a locked back slide when it didn't start that way, and the holosight not behaving like a real one just kill the experience outright for me.

After only playing for 30 minutes, this game appears to be more like a mod someone made that takes away half the functionality from R6 Raven Shield, than a standalone release that is ready to be sold on the shelves, even if it only costs $15.

My recommendation is rather than spending an hour playing this, spend the next 30 minutes finding your old Raven Shield disk and play terrorist hunt for 30 minutes.

Mmmkey, first i thought:  fck this, i will uninstall this game after trying it etc. 25 min. Then i thought, no wait. Let it be, may be DEVs will still work with that game  its 20.10 2013  and im now waiting for some months probably before uninstalling.

Anyway, DO NOT BUY this game RIGHT NOW if u wanna get a serious video game. At this point, its only a "trolling game" for having some stupid time spending fun. This game includes insta-deaths (but only for u, not for enemies), silly acting NPC.s and every time u respawn u will get a new prime weapon(!!?), no matter what, u have chosen for your equipment at the beginning of the mission.....DAFUQ?!?   And those are only some "funny" things from Takedown: RS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SWAT 4 was written in 2005 and it is still a better game than this in every way.

The biggest issue is that its just not very fun to play. Respect the game looks ok, but If they had money troubles then it should have been spent on the basics and not pissed away on round penetration etc that you will never ever notice.

When 'free' games like Warframe are around, I cant think of a bigger waste of money....Hmm maybe betting that England win the world cup.

Save your cash, your

TL;DR - Don't Do It.    I was looking forward to a sneaker/action mashup, and all I got was a half-arsed shooter. I would have forgiven this game if the stealth was any good, but it's just laughable. Enemies have don't see you when you're standing in front of them until their surprise meter runs out. You can stab people in the neck after sneaking up on them with your nano claws, but can't use it in any form of meaningful combat if you get caught in the open. There seems to be all of one line of dialog for enemies you catch off guard.The list of inadequacies is a long one. Read the first line - Don't Do It. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh no this game! YEEESH! Where do I start, with the atrocious graphics or the laughable QTE'S. First off before you read this review and your thinking about buying this game don't even bother with this game STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME MAKE IT YOUR GOAL TO AVIOD IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! Alright so before my tantrum I was going to say that this game is an ON RAILS ARCADE SHOOTER because of that we have enemies that are supposed to be tough to kill but the terrible A.I. does not make that happen just like the movie enemies that who cant hit the broadside of a **** barn. Also another thing that I should point out is that RAMBO LOOKS LIKE **** And this game was made in 2014 it looks like an early XBOX game as in the original. Finally thank you Reef Entertainment FOR MAKING THE BEST PILE OF **** GAME THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN JUST, THANK YOU. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fact that this game is a rail shooter is the reason why there are so many negative comments and reviews. Seriously, there's a reason why no one makes them anymore. This is 2014 not the 90s (it's outdated basically). This game would be more enjoyable on a console with a light gun because at least it has some value to it. This game with a mouse and keyboard is completely pointless. Throughout the advancement of video games and technology, rail shooter serves little purpose now (especially on PC). Rambo was never a good franchise, the first movie was quite good because it was an emotional and complex character study while the sequels were just mindless action movies. Despite that, Rambo could be an impressive game. But alas, this game disrespects the franchise. It's just a simplistic game with a well-known license slapped onto it. This game should be avoided at all cost, even for fans of Rambo. Rambo fans who defend this game are just disgraceful. I'm surprised that they can get away with charging idiots full price for this game (£29), not worth it even on console. I can buy a much better shooter with that much money, one that has better graphics and texture quality at least. You can throw a grenade in this game, like WOW! And apparently, you can heal when you kill enemies as well as disarm them when you shoot them in the legs. All the enemies look the same and this game is like 3 hours long. I know people hate CoD but this game is an example of an even worse shooter. I give it a 2 because it's not the worse game in the world. If I went to an arcade and I saw this game, I would give it a go. Put a pound in, pick up the gun and I would've enjoyed it a lot more but seriously, DON'T BUY IT!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately, it feels like it tries to appeal to my nostalgia, but like Duke Nukem Forever it doesn't work if it doesn't keep with the times. I think it might've done great back in the time of arcades with the pedal to expose yourself and use plastic guns like Time Crisis, but it doesn't work here. It's an outdated on-rail shooter mechanic with no originality, the QTEs send up a red flag for 'lazy day' development, the graphics look strange or subpar like with Rambo's features, the last level is too unbalanced and massive difficulty spike, some spots where you can't take cover annoy me (last I checked, I wouldn't like getting shot at), the limited ammo mechanic is annoying if I can't move from my on-rail shooter spot to get some more, the perks and weapon choices are useless and all feel the same (it's a cursor, no recoil or anything feels different about the guns), I expect controversy with shooting policemen and expect to go Rambo on killing them, there are finicky instant death moments like if I miss an arrow or miss a QTE and the enemy kills me.

There's too much salt to cover the nostalgia to get to the taste of it. I think it's an insult to those who love Rambo or for those looking for a good video game in general. I wouldn't recommend getting it. Also, there are some bugs such as being stuck in slo-mo, the music loops are distinct and unsettling, and the game crashes spontaneously for PC. $40? I don't think so. $10? I don't think so. Free from a friend? Why do you think he's getting rid of it? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game looks just awful and that might be something caused by the long time it took to develop this game but it's still fun for an on-rails shooter 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not going to give this game a 9 and then tell you about the mass amounts of flaws in this game. 9s should be reserved for games with very few flaws. The repetitiveness of this game as well as the Character AI really bring this game down. It was playable at first but then became a chore to wade through. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is very nearly a great game. Diehard fans of the genre might look past all the failings, but most gamers will be looking for the receipts in under an hour. The title lacks polish- boring dialogue, confusion, the elephant stomp running sound, etc...- to such a degree that it is hard for most gamers to enjoy. Deeper flaws in the game- repetition, clumsy combat, overly complex itemization, etc...- make the game hard for genre fans to enjoy. Diehard fans might look past all that and SEVERELY OVERATE THIS GAME ON METACRITIC, but at the end of the day this game still stinks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I only bought this because it was on sale for 2 bucks and it has easy trophies. Other than that dont waste your time with it- its a very boring fighter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Decent story idea, bad execution. Game ran choppy on systems that run Crysis ok. The voice overs were over the top, but not in a good way. It made me want to turn my audio off. The art style that they chose doesn't work for most games, so they should have gone a different direction with it. I just feel sorry for the game more than anything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics poor. Game crashes repeatedly. Sound and sound samples are repetitive and of poor quality. Gameplay is slow, repetitive, and non-entertaining. If you can get this game to work for more than 10 minutes, you will already be bored out of your skull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the show and I got the game cause I thought it would be good. It was not worth the money I paid for it. To only have 4 episodes was a joke I've scene better games. I would not suggest other people to buy this game even if they like the show. Worst game I've played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's a reason this game hasn't been reviewed yet: it'd be savaged if it were. The control scheme is awkward to non-functional, the seconds-long game-stopping transitions from standing to being knocked down are more than annoying, and the graphics and sound are barely serviceable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had been anticipating this game for months, and after the release date slippage and shoddy-looking animation on the preview videos, I became somewhat skeptical. Then I read a review on another site suggesting that the play control was actually excellent, so I went and bought the game tonight after all. And oh, how I wish I had that $30 back. The play control is somehow worse than Wii Boxing, especially with the left hand. Whereas Wii Boxing would have inconsistent punch control, this has pathetic dodge control, horribly inconsistent punch control (even though I'm a right hander, I *never* had the problems executing left-handed punched in Wii Boxing like I did here), and the movement sometimes just doesn't know when to quit. I can't count how many times I tried dodging using the appointed gesture (which is the same as Wii Boxing), only to be left flat-footed. My boxer's left hand seemed unable to throw a punch, and my boxer would somehow insist on retreating (and you can't throw punches while you're moving), so I'd often be left for a punching bag. And the load times between screens are simply abysmal. When you knock an opponent down, it actually takes a second or two to bring up the shot of the referee counting (always either a 7-count or a 10-count, nothing in between)! And then, it takes another second or two to load the regular boxing action back up! There's a slightly entertaining mini-game when you get knocked down, in which you have to guide a bullseye onto a moving target to rise, but again, the pauses really disrupt the gameplay and prevent the suspension of disbelief. The get-up mini-game is one of the few good things in this game; others involve the presence an energy bar to increase the strategy involved in the game and...well, I'm sure there's something else, but I just haven't found it yet. And I'm not sure that I'll spend another few minutes on this game to find out...ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

started out fairly solid game crashing bugs and corrupting games ruin a good experience. after three play throughs and being unable to progress for an extended period of time before the game freezes up, crashes, and refuses to ever load again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is awful, it should be ashamed of even bearing the name Dead Space. There is nothing in this game that feels like a Dead Space game. There's no cutting limbs off of enemies. there's no tension, there's no scary moments, and the cut scenes look like **** An absolute mockery of the Dead Space name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing. Poor graphics, difficult to control-unforgiving. The story line is uninteresting. Just all around, not much fun. Your $ is better spent on a different game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst games I've ever played. The story is boring, the graqphics are bad even for the DS but the gameplay isthe worst part of all. You play through a level using one of the four characters where enemies give you a cheap death and the character's abilities are stupid. After dying several times because of the high difficulty (not because of great game design but because enemies are terrible and gameplay is terrible) you get to a boss section when you use a vehicle in the way of a side-scrolling shooter. This adds a whole new meaning to BUTTON MASH and is extremely difficult. Don't ever get this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't ever consider buying this game like I did. Movie-to-game never works and it shows in this "game". Graphics are **** Gameplay is **** Everything is **** Do NOT buy this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked Dawn of Fate, but this game makes DoF look like a game of the year winner. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It only hurts when you play it.  broken, takes the fun out of dodgeball.  You might as well be a geek against 500 jocks and get pummelled by a million dodgeballs.  I guarantee it would be more fun than playing this game.  not worth the money, spend it elsewhere... even at the price of free, I cant recommend this game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is awful !!! It is so repetitive,buggy ass release and with it's extreme repetitiveness it is one of the worst rpg's I played on the ps3.Just like Risen and Risen 2 the game is just an extreme big cash in.It is awful and please do not buy it.And graphics... they are even worse than the first Risen.The game is just bad,don't waste your money on it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having a liking for ranged attacks,I plumped for shotguns and muskets,---bad choice !!!---since,if you inadvertently fire before the orange circle is complete,the game freezes,and one is forced to start again by switching the PS3 back on. This has happened more than twenty times,and one is then forced to simply use a sword instead of a firearm------it makes a mockery of the whole game,---am very disappointed. Incidentally,I am 78 years old,so therefore have lots of patience,but this is just too much.

Alekhine's Gun is being marketed as in the spirit of the Hitman franchise, it isn't anywhere close to it.  Within seconds of starting the first level you will quickly discover that you have been deceived. The AI for the guards is either hyper sensitive or completely unaware of your presence. The missions are boring and unoriginal as you move from one hit to the other hoping for something interesting to do but are always disappointed. It should also be said that the graphics appear to be last generation at best. My advice is to avoid this game at all cost and wait until it is available as either a Xbox Games with Gold or PlayStation Plus offering. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely horrendous visuals, a mindless story, and broken gameplay, Damnation is damned bad. It is one game that should be avoided at all costs! There is nothing more to say about this game than to say that if you buy it, you will be reminded of the worst on other platforms, cough Superman 64, and why we hate bad games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A  catastrophic disservice! Kalypso has ripped off the 4x community and handicapped everyone who brought it over Steam (TOS: non-refundable)   Customers who have brought this product have been swindled.  This sort of thing is unlawful. Steam has one mother of a class action lawsuit compiling against them one day.  Effectively Legends of Pegasus is in an alpha state, its massively broken, bug ridden, and the features its meant to have are a lie  (in its current alpha state dated: 14th aug 12)   There is incredibly limited ai, combat pathfinding, technical issues up the wazoo (no vsync on launch or any other graphics options) Is this game redeemable?  Take a look at Kerberos's product Sword of the Stars II, and thats a good indicator of what it takes to get a game like this on its feet, damn near impossible! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so insulted by this game that I opened a tech support ticket with Metacritic to fix the release date so I could submit a review.

It started with the account sign-up.  This is not uncommon, but I have no clue why they required me to sign up for an account for a mostly single player game.  I tolerate other games with this requirement, but I never like it.  Especially when the game is part of an established always-on network, like Steam.  For me, the game has a lot of bugs and glitches. I ran into recoverable freezes at several points, including adjusting the volume.  Several camera keys just didn't work at some points and basic polish was lacking.  For example, Esc opens the menu but no key closes it.  Basic feedback on actions is nonexistent. I tried repairing ships several times but nothing ever happened.  Each time, the unit confirmation sound played and nothing ever happened - I still don't know why.

While on the subject of the unit confirmation noises, these have to be the worst part of the game.  The confirmation and acknowledgement sounds seem to be pieced together from various sound bytes to sound like military chatter.  It sounds terrible because each sound byte is said in a different yet still monotonous tone.   The chatter is also constant in a battle.  Cries of "Shield stress levels are very high!" abound, even when shields all seems pretty relaxed.

The game play is very slow paced.  I spent 60-70 turns just hitting the End Turn key before I even got to some basic story.  I realize that 4X games tend to be on the slow side but there is usually lots to see and do while you wait for things to pick up.  LoP has very little in the way of management and information screens to browse and tweak.

This was touted as Sins of a Solar Empire but with a single player campaign and story.  The intro was a black background with voice-over and text.  I really would have liked to see THAT game.  The game just kind of dumps you into a situation with little background and starts into the first few missions.  After almost an hour of game play, I saw some proper story sequences.  The dramatic tension of the entire story went down the toilet for me when they demanded I build a shopping mall before establishing any sort of defenses or governance for my beleaguered colony.  Aliens may be attacking but there is this awesome sale at the outlet!

Maybe things speed up later on, maybe the story gets better, maybe I am being harsh because I was very much anticipating a good 4X game with ship customization.  I know that with other 4X games like Sins and Homeworld, I was into them from the start.  I didn't feel like I had wasted my money.  So buy this one at your own risk. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dated graphics, dated UI, just plain dated. Couldn't get more than 15 minutes into the game, just not anything that stacks up against a game I would expect in this era. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is a glimmer of a solid game, 3 months from now but it looks like the devs believed they could fix their gaggle of gamestopping bugs with a day 0 patch, the release of this game is basically down right theft on the publishers behalf, if released as an MMO the launch would have been reviewed as awful but for a essentially single player game to be released like this is a whole new category of bad that the English language lacks an appropriate word for.

"to the minority of users who post nothing useful in the forums and think that whining like a 5 year old in a playground will solve anything (avoid the forums like the plague or you will get accused of being a corporate bot or a troll) I believe they will fix the problems and I am looking forward to seeing where they go with this" Youve got to be kidding. So pretty much in your opinion people dont have the right to be angry after exchanging their cash with a steaming pile of crap. Im sorry but that is such a load of **** Im sick of games being released half assed. It seems to be happening more and more these days and people like yourself defend this **** Or maybe you work for Kalypso seeing you just gave it a 10. Really a 10 out of 10, and your positive comment is "I believe they will fix the problems and I am looking forward to seeing where they go with this". If thats a 10 what do you give a 1 or 2? Yeah you might say I havent contributed anything to reviewing it ,but pretty much the 18 or so people who scored it three or below pretty much sums it up with the comments. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It sucks really bad! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Broken. Completely broken. The controls are broken, the core gameplay itself is broken, broken, broken, broken. The controls have achieved a magnitude of suck I previously believed wasn't humanly possible, with plenty of buttons that do nothing and the majority of responsive buttons yielding crappy, ineffective moves. Multiple times in one fight, I would be facing and pushing the joystick in one certain direction, when suddenly, my character decides to veer off in a completely different one. Many of the celebrities I have never heard of in my life and the monsters are incredibly lame and clearly thrown in to make up for the lack of celebrities that agreed to be a part of this horrific, ugly mess. The voice-acting may be the best thing about this game and it too is not that good. I like how they included the actual announcers from the show, but many celebrities do not have the actual celebrity doing the voice-overs. The game is riddled with factual errors, ridiculous camera problems, and terrible animations. The create a celebrity feature sucks, just like the rest of the game. The only apparent positive that this game has is its humor. The game utilizes stupid humor to the max. You'll definitely get a few chuckles in, making this game good for about a few rounds. If you are inconceivably bored beyond tears, heavily stoned, or curious about self-induced mental torture, then this game is worth playing. Everyone else, move along. There's nothing to see here.

Dino Beatdown is a survival type game, where humans with high-tech weaponry fight hordes of oncoming dinosaurs. It takes place in vast landscapes, where the player must activate the power generator of one out of four bases and fight the incoming dinos. The game was first released in a rather horrendous state, making it impossible or very difficult to join or make servers, the game would crash often and such. While these issues have (for me) largely been ironed out with the first patch, the game is still full of glitches. Sound breaks down after map switch and the first person gun models don't properly react when you fire (leaving you with a feeling of killing raptors with a potato gun). While these are issues I'm sure will be solved by the developers, the game also suffers from some problems in the design. For one, the assault class seems to be the only to have an easy way of getting out of the way of the larger dinosaurs with the jet pack. The medic especially seems to be in trouble when faced with an angry t-rex, leaving them with the rather boring option of staying in-doors popping out every once in a while to pump a clipload of lead in the big lizard. The dinosaurs can't climb, so the right thing to do is get on top of something and shoot the hordes of dinos who are running around below like it's a free crack handout in a bad neighborhood. It is kind of boring that the smartest thing you can do as an "assault" is to just camp on top of something. When you die you'll have to wait until the other players either kill enough dinosaurs or they die themselves and you lose the game. This might be a very long time since the last player can just take a vehicle and go any old direction. We seem to lose a lot of players who die early after a spawn, because they don't want to sit around for 15 minutes waiting to re-spawn. The game now has an option for buying a new life after dying, but if you can't afford it you'll still have to wait. There are only three types of dinosaurs in the game - T-Rex, Raptor and Rahm. While the rahm (a flying dino that'll pick you up and fly away with you) is an interesting touch, the design hasn't been followed through here either: only the assault class has a way of surviving when dropped by a rahm. The recon and the medic will just spatter on the ground below. Killing these three types of dinos quickly become boring, and the game could really do with some more kinds. The game has a selection of vehicles, but alas, here the design is again lacking. The flying type of vehicle is a game winner - the dinos can hardly hurt you and you get to spend the rest of the game bombing defenseless lizards on the ground (and the terrain is game-from-1999-ugly when seen from above). The vehicle direction controls are mouse based, with is fine for the flying vehicle, but just feels clunky and incomplete for the ground based ones. The game is in a much better state than when it first came out (now it is playable), but that also means that all the design flaws come out. It's fun to exploit some dumb dinos who can't get to you, but it will grow old very soon.

Summary needs to be update with the latest patches "New Name" Orion: Prelude which was just another patch or update. Sad to see such an attempt to distance the game from it's original release. Each New Name is just a basic update.

Honestly this game would've done much better had it stayed Early Access until this 3rd Name Changing Patch was finished, probably wouldn't have such a low score.

The game it self seems to have improved, not much but it has, my low score is from the Developers Attitude towards the games community. Simply stamping a New Name on your game won't fix anything. Claiming the new patch has enough content to warrant a new name when it's not even close to a new game it self is rather sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Borderline unplayable. Don't waste your money. So flawed its like the developers never even tried it before it shipped! Oh, and its VERY brown. All of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+1 for Abe Lincoln standing next to a Cyborg/robot super soldier and +1 because I'm sure there was at least 1 person at Blue Omega that fought to keep this from shipping, it's sad they probably fired him/her. Controls, muddy and unresponsive. Not only is the analog not smooth the enemies jump around like parkour runners on speed. Note to all game makers give the player 1 of 2 options, a simple lock-on or precise analog control. Graphics, it looks like somebody took a can of clear lacquered glitter paint and sprayed down every wall and rock in the game, this isn't just unrealistic it literally gave me a headache. Story, only played for about 20 minutes, I apologize to the person that possibly wrote a kick ass story about Abe Lincoln fighting laser shooting robots (the game may or may not contain this, if not you may contact me for licensing rates). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The biggest piece of cr*p I've ever played, seriously stay away from this game, it's a total waste of time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A boring, repetitive, uninteresting game. This could be released in 1978 and only be considered decent. It's unbelievably outdated and thin. Not impressed.

Damnation gets a 2.4/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"X-Men: Destiny" was a major disappointment for me. Prior to this game's release I had heard of the mechanic of customizing your own mutant and your powers. I had even heard that the story-line will change depending on what side you choose. Unfortunately this game not only failed to live to my expectations but it also left a bad taste in my mouth with really bad mechanics and repetitive game play. The story line follows the X-Men after the death of Charles Xavier as they try to fight off against an extremist group called the purifiers. You play as one of three stock characters and you can choose only one of three powers: energy beams, shadow manipulation, and body armor. None of the starter characters are compelling as they are really nothing more than mere stereotypes. The returning characters from the comics have a few moments to shine but they end up being nothing more than quest givers. The main plot itself even had potential but it failed to keep me invested since it doesn't go much in depth as it could have considering the complex-lore of the X-Men franchise. On the Wii cut-scenes are done through still images which looks bland and reeks of laziness in Silicon knight's part. The dialogue tree is tacted on at best and pointless at worst since no choice impacts the course of the story. Where this game really falls apart is in the basic design. The combat is highly repetitive and tedious as yo rely on pressing the "A" button on the Wii remote over and over again . Enemies drop like flies as you button mash your way to the top. The bosses don't fare that much better because you only rely on one strategy to beat them. The sequences are visually impressive but the actual mechanics are pretty simplified to the point that I might as well be playing "Dragon's Lair". The customizing hurts the experience instead of helping it since when you choose a power or suit, you are stuck with that suit or power for the rest of the game. There is no chance to test them before equipping so if you pick a customization you are not satisfied with than you are completely out of luck. On top of all of this, the game is ugly to look at with brown layed throughout the game with out of date character models. This game has a lot of potential but that potential has long been lost as it was rushed to meet a deadline instead of being made from the desire to make a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surprisingly I did not encounter any bugs or glitches in this game. Some performance issues with the game stalling for a couple seconds in the after-race screens, and a slight drop in frame rate here and there during races, but overall a solidly built game from a technical standpoint. That's pretty much the only thing good about this game, and the only reason i gave it a 2 instead of a 1.

The difficulty spikes in this game are incredibly massive and quite frequent, with some races being won 5 miles ahead of 2nd place, and others requiring 4 or 5 retries before finally getting 1st place. Controlling your kart is quite difficult, as the control input has some minor lag and not enough sensitivity, on top of the controls themselves being quite loose, sluggish and overcompensating. For example, turning: it takes about a second for your kart to start turning after you make the input, where most driving games take a couple milliseconds, and the turn starts real slight and suddenly shifts to a hard turn. This takes a while to getting used to, and can often cause you to hit walls or to slow down too much and over turn. Bumping into walls at moderate speeds causes you to bounce really far backwards, and your kart takes a couple precious seconds to start up again. If you crash or get hit with a weapon, it takes a whopping 7 seconds to respawn, and another 2-3 seconds to get going again once you're back in. So if you're barely in first place and wipeout somehow, you end up all the way back in 5th place. This, combined with mediocre track design and some BS obstacles that can only be avoided if you know they're there because they're around tight corners, make the game artificially difficult, and ends up being an aggravating experience. There's quite a difference between difficult and straight-up BS.

The weapons in the game are decent. There's the EMP which negates any weapon you have and slows you down a little, the Rockets which fire two homing missiles at up to 2 targets, the Shield which seems to constantly be obtained when you don't need it and never when you do, and the Uzi which is by far the worst weapon in the game. Minuscule damage and non-existent accuracy force you to literally be right up on another racer's bumper in order to hit them with Uzi rounds, and even then most of them miss. The other power up in the game is the boost, which only lasts about 2 seconds and you can't use any weapons while boosting, making it more useless than helpful. Pressing or holding Circle allows you to melee other racers with a cane or equivalent, but even fully upgraded, the damage it does and the range it has is so small, it's barely worth using. Weapons obtained from the power up boxes aren't balanced either, so if you're in 1st place, most of the time you will get rockets or Uzis, which serve no purpose there, and if you're in last place, you can often get oil cans or shields, which also serve no purpose there.

For game modes, there's Story Mode, which consists of 13 races across 5 themed areas. 99% of your time will be spent here. You need to complete the story mode once as any of the Oldies, and then again as the Grim Reaper. Crazy Grandad requires you to collect items before the time runs out. That game mode is one that probably will only be played just for the trophy, as it's not really that fun and gets boring immediately. Time attack is another mode that probably won't get played, unless you want an easy way to do the Skater and Biker trophies. Time attack usually is good for practicing and getting to know tracks, but you don't get any coins like in Story Mode, and there's no progression system either, which makes Time Attack a waste of time. Explore mode does absolutely nothing, it's just free roam. There's no point.

The game costs $11.99, and its actual value is probably around $3.99-4.99. Any more than that is a waste of money, even for the trophies. This platinum is short, only about 3 hours, but it's quite an aggravating and rage-inducing game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am glad that Mike R., Ryan W., John S. and Joe W. Nintendo employees really liked the game. For the rest of us non-biased people, this game is completely unplayable. If you want to spend an entire game begging for your life to end, play this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Perhaps the worst adventure title of 2003. A dull adventure game wrapped up badly in the ugly clothing of an obsolete FPS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for this game...however, I'm stuck at the water elevator and can't progress. Why do companies release a game when one cannot finish it? I have again wasted good money on a bad game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too many times is idiot. I thing that enemy intelligence is based on abnormal soldier. If yuo shoot a person, it regenerates unrealistitically. Each level should having a limited number of enemies, strategically positioned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst ww2 game ever made. I'd rather play Battle for the pacific. The gameplay is unfinished. The graphics look like late ps2 or Xbox 1 graphics, its a generic buggy mess. The controls are horrendous. Everything about Hour of Agony Is horrible. One of the worst game this generation. Worse then Rogue warrior. Please do not buy this hilarious excuse for a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst games ever made! Broken mini games, awful graphics and art style, and annoying sounds. This game makes some very bad games look golden...or at least silver. I honestly tried this game, hoping that the bad reviews were just overly exaggerating how bad it is like a lot of critical reviews. But I was sadly wrong, and this turned out to be one of the worst video games, if not THE worst video game I've ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks a$$. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

for the love of God that is not game , they wanted us to do an imitation of gears of war however did crap endured not go further this game because the game sucks everything in it is bad but all the same !!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cute graphics, but it really does suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is just bad. the physics are awful, a ball moving at an angle can bounce off the side at the wrong resulting angle, and momentum can be transfered perfectly from one ball to another. like the other reviews said, things don't make sense. not enough time was put into helping the gamer have fun. games made from movies are better than this game. don't waste your time (or money) on this, even for the pics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If I had to pick a word to describe this game, it would be... "Dreadful". Really. What are the main things we expect from Far Cry? Gorgeous environments? Excellent AI? Well you won't find either of those things here. Look at the ground about 10 metres away. Its just green. Walk forward. 2 metres away, it renders some foliage. Try driving a vehicle. If you can live with 10fps, you're a better man than me. The AI is *wait till you get close then shoot badly, repeating uncomprehendable phrases*. Redeeming features: Some of the feral powers are cool, but not really new. Environments are pretty big. So yeah, mostly awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad graphics, terrible controls, horrible sound! The game looks like a N64 game, the controls are probably the worst I played on the WII by far, if you punch walls they somthings make flesh sounds. Gameplay is ok I guess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the first bad game that I actually played and that's disappointing for me. The gameplay was just lame and repetitive and the kinect missions were just unresponsive and boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We've already had a bad Potter game in Goblet of Fire. (Check out my review) Now this franchise has been turned into a shooter, a bad one! The graphics are dull, the enemies are repetitive and the controls aren't well layed out. Harry Potter is just a mindless shooter now, which makes me sad. A good soundtrack, but sadly, there are no other redeeming qualities. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's not a 0 only because sometimes you just have to appreciate the fact that they made the game a Godzilla game. I almost want to rate it with a curve because the franchise just sucks really bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible, just horrible. Play anything else, "Rampage: Total destruction" is a better Godzilla simulator than this. Just save your money and watch the movies, well not the 1998 one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh my god I love me some Godzilla, I've played all the fighting games.. but **** this game and burn it with fire my friends.

This game is an unbalanced incoherent mess, Hedorah slaughters everyone but Biollante who just barrels through everyone and they broke Destroyah... how do you do that? How do you break the best monster to be the worst monster I've seen. No wait, Rodan. L1+R1+Triangle wins every damn time. This game is just as broken as everyone says, I am NOT on a bandwagon here, it's seriously that bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's in colour, and for the most part you understand what is happening. Such a sorry and utterly pathetic waste of potential that actually raises doubts over Kinect's continued support. Avoid, at all cost. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game simply put is an unplayable mess.  The Kinect has proven time and time again to be a waste of gamer's money, but the limitations of the unit are on full display here.  I had such a hard time attempting to do ANYTHING, that I simply gave up about halfway through the game.  I had high hopes for this title, but this game above all others cemented my hatred of motion controls. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a terrible idea. Characters doesn't have a personality, there were camera issues, terrible combat and a forgettable, dumb storyline. Don't waste your money for this crap, there are so many games that are better than this piece of sh*t. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a very big insult to every Harry Potter's loyal fan. The gameplay is so lame. Some missions are just frustrating (putting a cloak on and checking if one is a Death Eater). The graphic is just better than previous games but is outdated in compared to current game market. The game is not recommended, even for hardcore Potter's fans. The better the movie is, the worse this scrap is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is an offence to all HP fans! It's just awfull, is like Call of Duty but with wands, and unfortunately this one isn't fun at all. The story follows well the movie but there isn't anymore more those information of the book that made the games even better. The spells are "riddikulus" in this game and you will probably only use Stupefy and one other, the rest is useless. Ans those mini-quests that some parts of the game are boring. At the end this is a bad game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was absolutely disappointing. I went through the whole arduous process of installing the game and waiting during the loading screens for an utterly underwhelming gaming experience. Three characters to play as, a focus on gaining money and points instead of gameplay, a flawed partners and allies system, a severe lack of variety in gameplay - the game was a bore hole. I was disappointed because I'm a huge Soulcalibur fan and have played almost every single game religiously, but this one left me wondering why I went through the trouble of downloading it in the first place. Even for a free-to-play game, it was a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an awful game this is. Its gameplay isn't executed that well, the controls aren't good, the graphics are awful and it lacks the concept of the film. Another thing that makes this game are the fighting levels, these parts are terrible and choppy; this fails to be a good game for the least part of it. Even Centipede and Space Invaders being added extras couldn't save this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

During the time, the FPS genre didn't  have to much importance, many games tried and other ( not to many) were able to be in top, ex:Halo, so this licensed game lacks the concept, and fails to be at least a decent game. The most laughable thing in this crap is that it also has fighting levels or genre on it, thats idiotic. So yeah as Arnold said, don't lose your head, unless you wanna be terminated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never played any tony hawk game's but i can tell that is WAY better then this, is just tony hawk with the simpson's logo, no story and terrible control's, it started with the intro, the music, the composition, the effect's are just **** with into the game it starts to go down hill, the control's my god is it busted, kind of as bad as dark castle for the sega genesis, i tried spinning while going up a ramp, i could not for some reason, i seen the characters spinning in the intro but i could not do it, with every thing you do doing a trick, failing or EVERYTHING, you all way's get commentary from kurk witch gets annoying really fast, as for glitch's their's a lot out the ass, don't buy this game for any fun you want, want a good simpson game? go get simpson hit and run or any the other ones from the nes or sega genesis, not this worthelss thing, i give it a 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been playing this game for about 5 years now and it is AWFUL. The gameplay tries paying homage to the tony hawk series but the controls are very loose.Very often you will approach a Half pipe quarter pipe etc. and push forward to gain momentum you have to pull back on the stick quickly before hitting the ramp or you will go forward and crash instead of going straight up.map design is awful there are random half pipes and quarter pipes littered on maps while this makes sense in scenes such as the construction site level it makes no sense on maps like downtown Springfield you will be skating around and see a random display of ramps and pipes. the gameplay gets worse  the further you get due to the unresponsiveness of controls  this is one of the biggest problems this game has you get taught new tricks that require more and different button presses but too many times you will press  a button and the stick to preform a trick and you will preform other tricks or sometimes you wont even preform a trick. the mission structure is lazy every level consists of two main objectives to pass 1. skate around and catch some kids who are skipping school or hit some signs. and 2. collect letters that spell out someone or something that is themed to the level  like "SKINNER" or "SQUISHEE". Seriously? you couldn't have come up with something more creative? 2nd place for worst part is the characters it sucks getting them and they suck at this game i wouldn't blame them either. You have to win a tournament  each level to unlock new characters combine all of the problems above with even worse map design and a limited amount of tricks and  try getting 70,000 points in two minutes its near impossible! and its a shame since later characters i actually liked from the show (Otto,chief wiggum) basically you will be stuck with nelson muntz for an eternity the music is bad its a remix of the original theme but it gives me a headache the game has a point system where you upgrade your skills it helps but barely changes your tournament performance. the voice acting sucks while the voice actors from the show are there the lines they recorded sound like they are emotionless.Overall simpsons skateboarding doesn't live up to be  a good tony hawk clone good simpsons game or a good game for that matter awkward and unresponsive controls near impossible challenges and the presentation which makes it seem farther from a simpsons game than its supposed to be.  the only points it can get is from the semi interesting but for the most part dull skill system. we should all be happy that fox interactive learned their lesson when they made hit and run and road rage 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Alright I bought this game the day it came out after watching the Preview on XBOX LIVE. I was sorely disappointed I promised myself that I would NEVER trade in a game for my 360... well I traded this one in. Its very hard to get into and after awhile it get boring REALLY boring. I remember bushido blade. Thats what I thought this game was gonna be like it. It isnt. I suggest just buying a PS1 and BB1&2 if thats the game you want because both of the BB titles CRUSH this game. It is def not a game to buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst game ever created. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lets start like this, you pick up a game in the store thinking, hey this game looks good, but when you put it in your game console to play, your eyes and ears begins to hurt. Well that's the case of this game. Bad controls, bad voice over, bad gameplay, horrible AI, its just that bad. If you wish to play this game, well go check it out. Buy i wouldn't recommended. Its just laughable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Vampire Rain sucks. That's all there is to it. Like the Earth spins, the sky is blue and dogs hump. Vampire Rain is a piece of **** One of the worst games I've ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh man is this game a pile of garbage. To make it short, Naruto Shippuden: Dragon Blade Chronicles is nothing but a quick cash grab from the developers. The story aspects of the game seems much unappealing and there wasn't a whole lot of innovation for the gameplay mechanics. All you did was press B and slash your way from start to finish. The multi-player functionality.... lol. What kind of 2 player battle is this? From the get-go, you only have two characters to chose from, Naruto and Sasuke. I'm not lying that's all you get even if you finished the story or not. Next you battle between each other in a lackluster stage environment where battles become waaaaaay too repetitive. Beyond that..... well its that! That's all you get from this game. A slapped on story mode and a laughable attempted for a multi-player experience. If it wasn't for the decent art design this game was going for, I really don't know who would honestly picked up this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought this was going to be more like TMNT:Turtles in Time. Boy oh Boy was I wrong. The game is painful to play, absolutely painful.  If you're a new member to the TMNT world you may like it. If you grew up watching the 80's cartoon stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thinking about buying this game? Well you should do a little research first then. A friend of mine and myself bought this game because we thought co-op would be fun with it.

As it is right now co-op is only barely working. You can only join random games, if you try to invite a friend, it just doesn't work. The developer states that they are aware of the situation and are working to fix it.

As far as the rest of the game goes, I am not really impressed. It is most definitely a budget title. As far as actual game options go, there are very few and far between. Upon running the game for the first time, it will start in windowed mode.

As far as I can see, there are no options to actually change the game's performance. I don't know if what it plays as, is what to expect or if it just automatically tweeks settings based on scanning your hardware, which we all known is a very imperfect practice.

The game doesn't look good. It looks like a late PS2 game in my opinion. The game is actually based off the new Nickelodeon cartoon, which I am not entirely a fan of, but regardless of that, I feel that it would have looked much better if they had attempt to follow the actual art style of the cartoon instead of going with this gritty, dirty style they actually went with.

As far as game play goes, the actual story mode feels clunky. You will be performing feats of ninja like agility, but it's all "context sensitive", you won't have to time jumps or learn any real skills, because the only time you'll be performing said feats is when you are near an object that requires it.

Combat is mostly a standard beat-em-up with some light puzzle elements and exploration, although to be perfectly honest the game feels mostly straight forward, it does not encourage exploration on any level.

There is an "arcade mode" that closely emulates the old arcade style of the classic TMNT games and that is were the good stuff lies, no matter how little it is. I honestly feel this game would have simply been better if they had just designed the entire thing based on around an arcade game then what they did.

My opinion, the game is broken right now and unless you like playing with strangers or by yourself, the game isn't worth actually picking up, but even when these extra features are eventually fixed, the game is hardly worth the $15.00 price they are asking for admission. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This may the the worst childish action adventure game have ever played. The story was cliche. The gameplay and combat felt sloppy, unresponsive and lazy. The soundtrack gave me headaches. The lockpicking/Hack mechanic was useless, It felt like Activision was trying to annoy players with it. This game is a cash grab. DO NOT BUY. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game clearly doesn't deserve 50$, I took all my time to finish it, it took me 6 hours. Graphics are really bad but that was not a big deal, the gameplay was catchy and the voiceover was amazing, from the two series actors. I was quiet optimist through the whole game, but then the game just ended, probably the worst ending ever in the video games industry. Even if you're a great fan of the Walking Dead, don't spend 50$ on that.

Total waste of money, $14.99 would have been dead on for this game. Not the 50 you have to lay out. My mistake was not looking into the actual game before purchase. This game is nothing more than a cash cow based on the TV show is all. If you love "The Walking Dead" that much buy it but if I were you then please save it until it goes on sale. The graphics system looked like half life 1 gen and the gameplay itself was terrible. (The PC version) Has very little health and ammo powerups unlike from what I've heard on the console that they have tons of health and ammo everywhere. This game completely disappointed me and I wish they would have taken more time to develop it as it could have been something great! But again it's a NAME cash cow game that takes the player by surprise after you buy it. The publisher should have been another warning for me to check into it before purchase as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a real shame this game was made the way it was, an utter cash in with the only redeeming features because the amazing voice acting by Norman Reedus and Michael Rooker. Graphics are a complete let down with rooms being full of nothing more than one chair and a table half the time, if this wasn't a Walking Dead game it wouldn't be worth a second glance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Kings of Cash-In have done it again. I seriously believe that this is what Activision has been reduced to: making bad games to cash in on licenses. This newest FPS cash in is very short so I will make this review short and spoiler free in regard. Walking Dead: Survival Instinct doesn't deserve $50 nor does it deserve $10. Survival Instinct is a complete disrespect to the license and its fans. On the PC version, you will experience horrendous frame rate drops from dated graphics that look like they could have been made for the PlayStation 2 and XBOX. A lazy story that ends abruptly with loose ends (though I seriously doubt Activision is going to release any DLC for this disaster). Terrible voice acting with some of the worst AI I've ever encountered because on five different occurrences, the Walkers in this game RAN....yes RAN!!! Also keep in mind that Terminal Reality is used the same engine that was used for Star Wars: Kinect. With that in mind you will experience badly timed QTEs and mini games that probably come from iPhone games and climbing mechanics straight out of Minecraft. If you are a fan of the series then stick with Telltale's version of The Walking Dead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's like Day of the Dead (horrible zombie-game on Unreal engine 2), but with «updated» graphics (still looks horrible).
The rush with which game was made shows. It's glitchy as hell. Shallow and repetitive gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Story and characters:none found in here.There's no weight to any of the characters and the story is laughable.After telltales master peace this game proves how badly things can go in this segment.
Gameplay:horrible.Its very repetitive and basic.It requires no skill no timing,nothing to be quite frank.Its just mouse button mashing over and over again.Weapons variety is poor and all the melee weapons do same damage also it takes 4 hits to kill a zombie no matter where you hit it.Also gameplay is very linear and map design isn't impressive at all.Also FOV is very narrow and there's no way for you to change it.
Graphics:yeh,they are bad.But the thing is that its a game from activision it's not an indie game.It looks like the game is made out of clay.Everyone expects good graphics from such a huge company but be prepared to be disappointed.This game looks ugly,it's obvious that they didn't even try to make this game look good.
Sounds:i guess its OK at best.Dialogues feel forced and since they are poorly written voice-over makes them sound awkward.
Bottom line:an obvious cash in on the franchise.Game is rushed out,it has nothing unique in it,nothing worth while. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Story

The Walking Dead: Survival Instincts brings you into an apocalyptic world where zombies roam the world. Throughout the game you play as Daryl Dixon, one of the main characters from the television show. In Survival Instincts, the story line gives general players and fans of The Walking Dead and insight look of how Daryl, and his brother Merle Dixon, met up with the main group and what they went through before that time occurred as well as show how Daryl achieved his ever-so famous crossbow.

The Graphics

Graphics quality in Survival Instincts somewhat lacks a dynamic punch, for example a walkers, otherwise known as a zombie, hair looks like it was made of glue or clay then molded onto the head. However, the diversity of each walkers face has it's own unique pattern of bite marks, scratches, shapes of the jaw, teeth and more, these all add to a good fright factor at the right moment of time e.g in a dark room, turning round and a walker attacks you out of no where. There are a great amount of bugs relating to graphics, such as broken fence pieces still floating midair, gates flashing black when opened, walkers floating when killed. All around missions have invisible walls, preventing you from going further away from the current map without any sort of police barricade, for example, taking away a bit of the realistic touch.

The Mechanics and sound

The AI is very sloppy, throughout gameplay I had opened a metal fence and the walkers still attacked the fence, paying no attention to me whatsoever, I then began to kill them one by one. When one walker died another took its place, as if they were lining up to die. The scavenging mechanics allow you to gather survivors and send them out to gather supplies, but the amount of survivors depends on the size of the car you currently have. That said, there are missions that allow you to find car keys to either bigger, or smaller, cars. When sending out survivors to scavenge for supplies, there is always a chance of getting them killed by walkers, depending on what item you give them to defend themselves with as each survivor has their own skill trait such as being good at using blunt weapons. There were countless sound bugs within this game, fences breaking with the sound of wood getting chopped, walkers dying with the sound of a metal fence breaking and more. The game includes a feature where the player can choose a method of travel such as highways, streets and backroads. Depending on what method you choose, one method can either consume less fuel or another method may take a road such as backroads where it consumes a lot of fuel with a high chance of breaking down. If, by chance, your car breaks down or runs out of fuel, a side mission will take place allowing you to scavenge the nearby area for fuel or car hose. The issue with the side missions is that they're very repetitive, as there are about 3-4 different areas.

The Gameplay

It felt a bit stiff trying to kill walkers, e.g using the sledgehammer was a lot quicker than normal. One thing that gives a good addition to gameplay is sneaking around, trying to sneak past walkers and stealth killing them by sneaking up from behind and executing the stealth kill action. Like any realistic movie or game, gun fire attracts walkers to your location so be sure to only use your gun in dire situations and ammo is scarce to watch out, you don't want to run out of ammo when you desperately need it. If you ever happen to get grabbed by a walker, it activates a grappling mechanic where the player must place the circle onto the walkers head, activate the attack trigger and stab them in the head. This method breaks fighting gameplay by 50% due to the fact after killing the walker that grabbed you, if there is another walker, it will grab you almost instantly after you let go of the previous walker, this allows you to kill over 15 walkers without using any ammo, losing any health and just drains the fun and realism out of the game entirely. On the last mission, near the very end the last thing you did is mount a military vehicles machine gun and kill any incoming zombies, after which it cuts to black screen and goes to the credits, without showing you how exactly Daryl and Merle met the group like the game was purposely made for.

Final Verdict

The game seems rushed, only to gain quick money. For the price of $49.99 or £31.99 makes the game a complete rip off, due to the lack of effort of the game. I feel the only reason others need to buy this game, is to play as Daryl Dixon and get to see Merle, even though he is barely in the game. A poor effort to a great series that could have become something incredible if more time was put into it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How did I complete this... This I'm sorry to say rubbish. The combat the level design it was rubbish I'm sorry but it's true. The gameplay sucked and the graphics looked okay but I could only run it on low. What the heck? I'm sorry but I have to give this a low score. Also i don't have multiplayer. I don't even know if there is any but there might be. But I lost half textures from the game to. Reason it did not download them. Why?

Overall
-Bad combat
-Okay Graphics
-Did not install correctly
Score 29/100 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pros:
Great voice acting
Motivating music

Cons:
Old Graphics
Broken animations
Performance
Confusing logics and scripting
Artificial Intelligence
Small maps
Basically lack of entertainment from gameplay

It's a rushed cashbrab, not much else to say 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a rip off! For the price and the name you'd expect more than this game. Even as a fan of the series, it is not worth buying. Do not buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not have to say anything more. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it............................ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off I truly wanted to enjoy this game. I been a gamer from the mid 1970's and own over 1 k games so can say I know what I am talking about when I say this is the worst game I have ever played hands down...and I played thrill kill on ps1.. This games logic is so messed up it hurts.. I will say tge graphics are good and sounds are nice as well but the game just is really not worth buying new or even used..maybe a rent if truly want to play something that will irritate the crap outta you. The game dosent even follow vampire lore. Bullets do not kill vampires more so 2-5 bullets kill the player..total illogical. I am pleased Kylapso tried to make this good but IMO failed baddly. Better to stick to Dungeons rather then fail at a game like this again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had the displeasure of playing this terrible excuse for a sneaking game. Everyone was complaining about someone else's terrible review that they all inflated this putrid game's score up.  Now that his review is gone, the score is far out of balance to what it should be.

The graphics are on par with an original xbox game, and watching the characters interact is a joke.  If you remember how acting on half life 1 looked like, this is the same.

The control is infuriating!  You'd think that having a teleport ability would be cool!  Not this game! It's so difficult to set where you want to teleport to, it makes more sense to walk there. On top of that, teleporting alerts guards from far and wide.

Which brings me to the 2nd part that bugged the heck out of me.  Feeding on people (Which makes no noise) alerts everyone around, whereas doing a giant loud instant kill punch to their back doesn't alert anyone.  Go figure...

The AI is so basic that it gets to be frustrating. As soon as you are found will rush to you, and then slowly back away when you try to get close to do your slow ass punch which makes any combat absolute torture.

If you want a great stealth game with awesome teleporting fun, get Dishonored! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely awful! Has no redeeming features and actually made me angry! Ive been robbed. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Its trying to exploit your love of ResEvil and its appaling. :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Should this even count as a spin off to resident evil? When i played this game i felt like i was playing a alpha version of resident evil 6. Dont get this game unless you love to torture yourself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Umbrella Corps is a multiplayer-based tactical shooter developed and published by Capcom. It is a spin-off of the Resident Evil series.

- Clunky Shooting
- Ugly Movement Animations
- Boring Modes 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game,Capcom disappoint you all, with a strange and frantic gameplay too much, expect much of this game, boring and horrible graphics, not worth 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks worst then Operation Raccoon City.

Graphics,
Looks like graphics from when PS3 started.

Sound,
Sounds are ok. Nothing that jumps out.

Gameplay,
I started a mission and 1 second into it I felt that it was going to be bad. There is a single and multiplayer. In single player its broken up into missions and the missions are all the same kill zombies get vials over and over again. You can use guns or melee weapon. guns are ok but the melee weapon is almost on par with the knife in CoD since it can 1 shot anything even in multiplayer. In multiplayer that's what you see most of the time are people running up to you and melee you.

Overall,
It's just so **** bad I played for maybe 1 hour then uninstalled the **** game. DO NOT BUY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off, the premise of having a shooter with a Resident Evil twist isn't totally a bad idea.  Especially because it would please the Resident Evil fans that tend to like shooters and keep them away from the main titles and more focused on this title.  (At least that's how this seems.)

Hell, just adding in the nostalgia of the classic maps, ubcs gear and flair makes it look badass!!  BUUTTT, don't let that fool you!

This title is so poorly made, it should have been a PSP title, with just the PVP portion added.  Everything about the gameplay SCREAMS beta and is shows no signs of fine tuning or refining!  Just look at the multiplayer, where you can CRAWL faster than RUNNING!  Not only that, you use all of you equipment doing so!!

Looking at RE5 and 6's mercenaries modes; UMB Corps is BEYOND TERRIBLE!!  The single player is NOT challenging and BORING.

(LONGTIME GAMER HERE and I've played some seriously underappreciated games with garbage graphics and STILL loved quite a few of them!)

The only reason I gave this a 2 is because the concept is a different take on the RE world, but one not to take serious as the survival horror games.  That, and there were some signs of potential in the multiplayer, despite it being a choppy mess of an experience.

For shooter fans, this game is a joke.  For fans of zombies, its a waste of time.  For fans of the Resident Evil series, its like the developers took a big steaming sh*t on their lawn and set it on fire! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the first Painkiller, and Battle out of Hell was even better. I saw screenshots and honestly was expecting (and looking forward to) more of the same, but DAMN.. The engine has not been improved at all in five years except for adding a poor bloom, there is little to no new content (I recognize nearly every enemy and every weapon from the first game, and one or two from Overdose), and the level designs are buggy -- many, many surfaces without a texture and in one of the levels you can very easily leave the entire level area. The second level has some cool environments like the ones I loved in the first game, but it's the only one. They tried making the levels less linear and more open, which would work in any other kind of game, but anyone who's played Painkiller knows how poorly that would work in it. In short, looks, feels and plays like a mod. The only reason I bought it was because if I preordered through Steam, it was $27 for it, Overdose and Painkiller -- $9 a game, not too bad. Still, I almost regret it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game, check out reviews on gamespot as well. This shouldn't even have the burout name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible graphics, watered-down gameplay, pathetic crashes, and collision problems and glitches make this the worst Burnout in the series.  The new game mode 'Pursuit' is nothing more than Road Rage with only one opponent.  And Single-Card multiplayer is seriously boring, as there is no traffic or AI and you can only race on one track.  The music in the game is tolerable but very limited.  Reviewer "Mike S." says it all.  I'm returning this and buying Mario Kart. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do have to give this game props on its graphics, but it just seems that since PSP came out, EA doesn't care about the DS. Let's see... NFS: Most Wanted, horrible. Marvel Nemisis, embarrising. Madden 2006, could have been a lot better. The only good games from EA are NFSU 2 and the 2 Sims games. EA is a great company when it comes to console and PSP, but is a complete embarrasment on the DS, and this game proves it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

UGH...what a travesty of a game. It's taken everything good that was Burnout and thrown it out, leaving a weak driving game with poor controls, weak graphics, and abysmal gameplay. We've seen through Mario Kart that the DS is capable of MUCH better than this. I'm just glad my boss let me return this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hec is this garbage? What a disappointment. This game is a disgrace and the people that made it should be ashamed. It's just so poor. Gameplay, controls....nothing works. The graphics are horrid. What is with these developers! Come on! Look at RE4. It's a Gamecube game but it looks 100 times better than almost every Wii game out. Graphics aren't meant to be the strong point of the Wii but that doesn't justify making games look worse than they should. If every game on Wii had the same graphical standards as RE4, noone would complain! But no, developers for Wii games are just downright lazy and don't want to make an effort. I hope they lose a tonne of money cause they don't deserve anything for this lackluster effort. Avoid this game! *screams* 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You have to blink for your character or his eyes dry out... that alone makes the game more annoying than anything I can possibly imagine avoid this game at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great Idea, horribly carried out. Throughout the game I was very disgusted with the camera angles. Sometimes the controls didn't work correctly. The ending (both that I've found so far) sucked terribly. The levels were alright, graphics were OK except on the characters. They were terrible. Overall, a waste of time. I am glad I rented this instead of buying it. Even my $2.50 for the rental was a waste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a major disappointment. The developer must have skipped all play testing before this game went gold. The controls are hideous as well as the camera angles. The graphics are some of the poorest on a WII game. Let me some up this game in one word - Frustrating. I am glad that rented it first. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are looking for a hack&slash, this isn't a hack&slash. This is a frenzy click-fest with items and some skills.

The only thing I can compare it to is diablo 1 (one), a 15 year old game which had more of everything in it (better story, better designed items and interface, more challenging). More can be written here, but it is nor worth my or your time. If this appeared before D3 and T2 then it might have had a chance because you would have played "anything". This is what the game is best characterized by: worst than anything else on the market now but better than nothing (and solitaire...maybe)... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It looked promising. It sucked. First of all. Well I can't list many because I just played one hour and I uninstalled it. If you want a good hack and slash buy Torchlight or Torchlight 2. Its worth the money and don't buy it or don't think "I like all the games everyone say is  because me and my friend played it and stopped playing it in like one hour. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This games was a disappointment. As a big fan of the park it was a must have, but after 2-3 hours of play. I already beat and unlocked everything in the game. I recommend it for players in the age group of 1-3 years, for when their parents want them to be occupied for 10 minutes. The only reason i gave it a 2 is for the movie music the is played when you are on the rides. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

USTP is far and away the worst game for GameCube. I have nothing good to say about it, and plenty to say that is bad. My first temptation is to rate USTP a mere 1 out of 10, but because a couple of the mini-games were tolerable for a few minutes I will bump my rating up to a measly 2 out of 10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply put: a shallow minigame collection and a poor one at that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring, short, uncharming and frustrating, got it as a birthday gift, and I could say this is the black sheep of my Wii collection, never truly finished it because its incredibly idiotic gameplay just got to my nerves, could barely get after the tomb level (the first one), after that... well... simply could not... horrible... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I fail to understand how anyone could rate this game a 10. Camera angle is rarely right to see anything thats currently kicking the crap out of you, and the poorly subtitled, and translated game makes me wish Bestbuy didn't purposely have a blackzone for cell coverage over their store to prevent me from googling the reviews before buying it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totaly agree with the Metascore on this one. This game is stupid - it surely have got FPS shooter in it, but  when you play the game, you don't get that, good game feeling at all. The game misses the general concept of "game" ... What i'm trying to say is.. This... Game... S**ks 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll give the game some credit for having a couple of jump scares (only works when you have your lights off), however the EXTREMELY slow pacing, frustrating controls and predictable moments really ruins the experience with Ju-on: The Grudge. If you like haunted house simulation gameplay, this might be your kind of game, though it seems less scary if you're retrying a level again. I recommend renting Ju-on: the Grudge and playing it with friends first. Hardcore single playing gamers will definitely get bored from this game right away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has good graghics if you have a big screen tv not an 10 inch tv you can't see any thang and talk about hard to beat Im got on the first mission and I barly beat IT! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Games based on TV series tend to be at risk of not feeling authentic enough to sit alongside the established universes that they offer. Back to the Multiverse decides to throw away the challenge of making a compelling game to sit alongside the TV series and instead gives us two discerning fingers right up the jaxie. The main problem is the game is roughly 4-6 hours of constant shooting, constant enemy respawning and alas constant boredom. Dialogue is recycled in a nonsensical manner from the TV show for instance Brian will belt out that he needs a midget with some gin to be in business- with zero relevance to what is going on. There are challenges to take on, a local multiplayer option and a seemingly impressive array of collectibles. But all of this doesn't make up for a shoddy, half arsed lazy cash in. Just watch Family Guy on DVD, at least you will get original concepts and ideas as well as shed loads of crass humour. Pick this up and bird won't be the word- but turd will. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

and one may say we waited for a new rollercoaster tycoon game, and this is what we got.
YES there was a teaser for RCT4, but that was "German" according to the video and YouTube and their Facebook page. While Germans MAY be getting RCT4 soon, THIS IS WHAT WE GOT.
(I hope that trailer wasn't fake) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remember playing this game all the time, spending countless hours building and making the perfect theme park. But this is not what i loved to play, yet while playing i found out that it could have been so much better. it has many of the pieces that could have made this game great, but in the end like many hand held ports this is a lazily produced game for a quick cash grab. Dont pick it up show Atari that we dont want this, we want a full fledged game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably one of the most obscene attempts at a gangster simulation game ever. Eidos tried to recreat a GTA style game in a different genre, and wow it didn't work. Don't buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game sucks period. If you love the socom franchise,this title makes socom online play look like a God. This is one game I regret I bought. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game makes it very clear that it takes place in an ALTERNATE HISTORY.  One in which Churchill dies early.  This is actually the cleverest part of the game--along with some really creative maps.  I mean the game still sucks, but let's criticize it for the stuff actually sucks at--like a ridiculous main character, and decades-old fps game play.  The guy who made the maps has talent and should leave and make maps for Fear.  They could learn from him. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I still do not understand why i never enjoyed the Army Men series. Frustrating gameplay ,no fun concept, the arcade design is very old and not fun except for Galaga. Sorry but I pass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aside from some interesting concepts and interesting character progression, this game is a mess.  Laughable dialogue, absolutely ridiculous and incoherent story, stupid characters, totally broken combat, abominable effects...This game is just in shambles.  It has some interesting ideas, but the execution is just...oh man...terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A totally bland and buggy game, Cursed Crusade demonstrates that trying to be like the big boys without a really unique IP will **** you over every time. There just inst anything here that you cant get a lot better somewhere else. Its no some much bad as just...meh 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is bad, ok, the movie can have some moments, but the game is terrible, is expensive, and is short, when you believe that you finish "the first mission" you finish the game. A big disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This video game is really really bad, at least the movie is better then this ****. The game takes it's self way to seriously even though the action is really bad and boring. The gameplay sucks and **** The Story doesn't make any sense and did I already said is boring? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like so many others, the conceit for this game was fascinating.  Underwater open environments!  New and interesting ways to fight in a dystopian, cyberpunkian future ruled by merciless corporations!  Lots of other stuff that, at most, gets passing mention in this game and has no bearing on the gameplay whatsoever!  Actually playing the game is the deepest (...hah.) of disappointments.  Thrill at having trouble getting onto a half-submerged staircase!  Marvel at the stiffest protagonist movement since Resident Evil 1!  Experience the pulse-pounding irritation of trying to make the sloppy, broken aiming work! This game not only did not learn from the current generation of FPS games' mistakes, it's still not sure that the mistakes of the 90s were really something from which to learn. Did I give this game a fair try? No, not really. After about half an hour of already repetitive, narrow corridors, enemies so bland I'm still not sure whether there was more than one enemy character model, godawful broken shooting, and getting caught on boxes and corners while trying to run around, I gave up.  Still, as the game is fairly pretty (except when it's actually moving or trying to do anything) and boasts mediocre voice acting to go with the atrocious script, as well as having at least attempted something novel, I feel that it has earned its 2.  This would have been significantly higher, no doubt, had they opted for a novel, interesting concept which they had some sort of idea for using.This game is like neon underlighting for your toaster.  It's a kinda neat, odd idea  that looks cool for a little while then makes you regret spending your money on such an utter waste of technology. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is it that games set in the ocean even when few and far between correlate so strongly with bad design? Hydrophobia: prophecy, Deadly Tide, and now Deep Black: Reloaded. I suppose I should have been warned LONG before I even made it to the register with this tome after all the game's unique selling point, right there on the front of the case was the fact that it 'supports nVidia's 3D technology!' But even after the install, I was leaning far, FAR back in my seat from the intro sequence when I was given a set of bullet points in lieu of an ACTUAL introduction. Then the dialogue started. Oh my god. No the voice acting isn't terrible, and no it's not as bad as sitting through Space Marine, but if there wasn't a 13 year old kid with ADHD and an obsession with burning things on the production staff of this game I will be surprised. There's the hispanic mission ops lady with the predictible accent and poor grasp of enlgish aphorisms, the over-testosteroned banter and deadpan delivery in the face of certain death and the enemies who not only spout the same three lines at you, that often make no sense: 'Unloading Grenade!' What grenade? The only truly immersing part of the dialogue is the assortment of 12 or more death screams... Yeah. When you put MOST of your effort into how people sound when their shattered bodies finally give out I'm gonna want to keep you away from the sharp things.
Oh and when it comes to certain death... Oh god the gameplay! What the hell were they thinking? I've never been a fan of Third-Person Shooters but this one is capital B.A.D. BAD. You run about 15 degrees to starboard of where you shoot and zooming in just exacerbates this disparity, if it wasn't for the auto-regenerating health it would be an even bigger headache. Even the underwater movement feels clunky. And in a game suffused with chest-high walls, only SOME of them are useable as cover, generally in combat areas, but even still that's yet another black mark against this game. The even MORE annoying thing about this cover mechanic is that the cover key is context dependent. Pressed when you're not taking cover you will do a roll in the relevant direction you happen to be moving. Wouldn't be so bad if the roll actually DID something, you move a total of about three inches while being completely exposed to enemies all over the shop. Also, why is there no jump key? Chest-high walls aside, it would be SUPER handy to be able to vault over cover and jump the odd railing. But obviously this was removed from the game to cover for the level design which features MANY areas which a player with a jump key could easily fall into and not get out of (unless someone invented say, a ladder), and the game would lose about HALF of it's ridiculously short key-quest style stair lowering 'quests' which amount to crossing a single room while facing maybe three or less braindead AI enemies.

That aside, with a proper amount of polish this game would actually be quite good, but the big problem is EVERYTHING needs polishing. The control system is half-finished, the level design--while it flows okay-- is still too simple and suffers from the aforementioned puzzle mechanic, the AI is boring, and predictible resembling space invaders more than current-gen shooters, and the weapons are bland, uninspired and look like they were picked out of Master Chief's weapons locker. The writing needs a lot more flesh on it before it can be called a story, and the truly sad part here is someone OBVIOUSLY had an idea, had a coherent sequence of ideas which did in fact resemble a chain of events and not just a few footnotes hastily scribbled on a whiteboard somewhere. Were it not for the fact that this game apparently has its own proprietary engine I would have said that Deep Black resembles an indie game done by a bunch of high-school kids, but the fact is that someone sank a lot of money into what amounts to a giant turd, and not a very polished one at that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

like others: nice idea... BAD attempt.I have quite and returned 5 times since release trying desperately to get my money's worth and give this a fair chance... but....Pros: ummm... none.graphics are 'o.k.' for a modern shooterCons: antiquated combatpredictable boring AIlimited AI actions/responses... you will see/hear the same thing 100 times in the first hour... painful!quirky controlsunmappable keysminimal menu options and dismal control schememediocre sound effectsbad voice editing...actors are o.k. but it does NOT flow naturally.poor scriptingterrible autosave checkpointsvery very very very linearI got sucked into the 'hype' and paid the $29.99 pre-order... ouchie.this is the ONLY game i have purchased in the last 5 years that i have TOTAL and aboslute regret *sigh*this game MAY be worth $9.99 (to some)... but even 'free' most will never finish this 'disaster' called a video game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only thing that good on this game is how good the graphics were and yeah,its optimized and the water sequence impress me,but the bad is more than good things.First,the Enemies,why enemies is totally hard to kill? Did they using Double-Armor Plated thingy or from their arse? Even on Easy too....The A.I. is poorly developed,its totally sucks.The Melee Sequence gets over-and-over-and-over till you get bored.The gameplay is Clone Gears of War + Halo Grenade + Dead Space Suit + Hydrophobia Prophency Water Effects and the game itself TOO REPETITIVE! The Multiplayer sucks too.I`m starting to like this game when start playing this game,but after 1 Hour playing this game,i really hate it.If you tend to wasted $29.99 for a shetty games,this is for you.Boring,Repetitive,Clone Gears of War,sucks.....

I was fascinated by the premise of this game. Underwater combat sounds like fun with an endless amount of possibilities. This game do sadly not live up to those expectations in any way. The movements and aiming is to start with clunky at best. The cover mechanic doesn't always work, you cant run and the main character moves like a big cube of metal. You might wonder why it matters how you character moves on land considering that this game is focused on underwater combat.

Well get that idea out of your head. This game is by no means focused on underwater combat. The water segments of the game is mostly used for you to get to land-area A from land-Area B. The game do now and then throw some underwater robots at you which triggers a repetitive and boring quicktime event which you basically cant fail at. The robots in question are also quite boring to say the least and i didn't encounter any interesting enemies in underwater which is a real shame.

But i don't want i to appear like my biggest complaint about this game is the lack of rewarding underwater segments. It was naturally disappointing that the game didn't match my expectations but i tried to give the land-combat a fair chance. And it was awful.

The fact that the controls were awkward wasn't a good start but there were a whole lot of other thing that dragged down the combat. The checkpoints were awful and all things cover related was a bit wunky. Which is quite bad when your whole combat is based around cover. Trying to throw a grenade from cover for example makes your character stand up straight and get shot to pieces while throwing.

Combine that with boring enemies and weapons and you get a combat which only succeeds in making you snore and rage.

The visuals are alright in the game. The visuals underwater do look pretty even though they are nothing out of the ordinary. On the land the game do look competent though a bit boring.

Now i know that i have been extremely critical of this game which is based upon the face that i had a terrible time with it. I should however mention that i didn't finish the game and that it its completely possible that the game does a 180 degree turn. That does not however sound very likely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

mildly fun game, but SOOOOOOOO LAME that you have to pay extra 240 MS credits as DLC to be able to change your robot's colors. Totally greedy!! Dont buy this game! otherwise it will encourage other developers to release games that are incomplete and will nickle and dime you more to play the whole game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

real steal is correct..pay ms points to allow customisation,repair wtf?!,even to play 2 player you have to buy DLC  to play?...in over 25 years gaming i have never come across such a blatant ripoff...even my kid who it was bought for said its a joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics of the game remind me more of a ps1/ps2 game, and the game mechanics are clunky. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i was incredibly dissapointed about how poor this game is. The controls are terrible, which is a shame because if it had had a bit more polish it would have been great, but no, it's awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ubisoft MUST be trying to ruin their good name... there's really no other explanation for how poor their Kinect titles are. The only good thing about this game is the hang gliding - it's actually fun. Every other sport in MotionSports has absolutely terrible controls that do not behave in a reliable way. Occasionally they seem to work, but only enough to cause frustration when you try to repeat the same movement and the game fails to recognize it. If you want to play sports games with Kinect, but you want to actually enjoy the experience, pass on this title and buy yourself a copy of Kinect Sports. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

they tryed to hard to make this game good with the graphics but this is a GBA not a Ds. so because of that the gameplay was slow. also I hurd this was orginally on the super Falcon in japan. so we are getting a game that is already way to old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It sucks. Its hard playing and its hard to unlock every thing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had a bad feeling about this when the game started up and I was treated to poor renditions of famous quotes from the movie... I was not proved wrong.... Just play the Rockstar version game... infinetly better in every way. Almost shameful, CTXM.... What were you thinking? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thank goodness for demos on XBL arcade. For the price, there are far better games out there. This one has tepid and boring graphics and very poor controls. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game just simply sucks.. The Graphicengine is taken from driver 1 (stright) and it really sucks and i DONT recommend it do anybody! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is only for Evil Dead biggest fans, fanboys and diehards. Meanwhile it's total crap for everyone else including me. Had some fun for 5 minutes before quiting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I honestly don't understand any positive review on this game. Now, I'm not trying to discourage anyone from either trying the game or recommend it to other, but please - make no mistake with this one and please, be very, very sure about trying it. I call this game "refund-dumb", because the first two hours of the game is quite... ok-ish. But you can't use Steam's refund option after the 2 hours, from which the game starts to fall on its head again, and again, and again.

Alekhine's Gun was initially Death to Spies 3 that took a lot of evident inspiration from Hitman: Blood Money. Getting those two games/franchises together, you might have a million-dollar idea on your hands. But AG fails to execute ANYTHING properly. The story is boring, the characters are dull, level design is terrible [1], game design lacks basic stealth options [2a] or execute these options terribly [2b]. Audio is probably one of the worst I've seen (or rather heard) in a B-title game. Dubbing (along with character models) is Road to Hell: Retribution-quality and most of the time, it sounds it's not even recorder in a studio but in some office with a bunch of friend sitting over a beer. Graphics aren't that much bad for a B-title, but the filters used gives you headache.

And the list goes on and on and on. I didn't even mention definitely one of the worst AI in games I can remember. They can't even climb the ladder. If you get close to anyone, he will just stand there staring at you forever until you move. Even if he or she was the one to bump into you. Lockpicking a door and someone sees you? They come to you, stop there, stare at you, you can just quit the minigame and they return to their patrol. Did I also mentioned that their reaction time is really long? Yeah.

This game has its ideas. A little polish to this, little polish to that, Alekhine's Gun could have had anything a stealth game needs to be... playable. But this game simply is not. Many people do 2 basic errors when it comes to "reviewing" this game. Especially on Steam.
A) They review it after playing barely and hour or too (see beginning of my review)
B) They praise this game because it's completed. Not like new Hitman, which was made episodic. And while I don't agree with that business model and I know that Hitman has its flaws too (there are many bugs and it's very demanding on computer, along with always-online DRM), I would choose Hitman anytime over Alekhine's Gun, because Hitman is in its core a fun game that makes everything, what makes Alekhine's Gun badly, good.

Please, stay away from this game if you value your 40€/$.

[1] - The levels are short, linear, unoriginal and the game reuses assets and design from DtS games - one library in the level 3 is the exact same copy of one of the Death to Spies hotel libraries.
[2a] - Hiding in closets for instance.
[2b] -  You can't move while changing equipment, interaction with environment is minimal, Instinct system is pointless, most of the disguises are pointless as well - you only need one to get more or less everywhere easily. By completing missions as stealthy as possible you get RP points, which you can use to buy new equipment, but... There is almost no stealth equipment available and you can get those hard-earned RP points from STEALTH to buy LOUD weapons. Where's logic in that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Before playing I read the users reviews here, so I can't say that I wasn't fairly warned. Like another user mentioned, the game seems to be trying to emulate Hitman Blood Money, but goes ahead and bungles all the things that made the aforesaid game pleasing and is a technical nightmare to boot...don't get me wrong there were aspects of the game that sometimes had flashes of inspiration like the lock picking and the art direction was good enough to carry off some decent atmosphere but all the mistakes like the broken AI where NPCs rely on cone sight distance and nearly only become suspicious from your costume and not what you are doing. More words would be a waste of time, this game crashes and burns spectacularly - twice my video card totally dropped out and I had to completely power offon the computer to get a picture back...sounds unpleasant doesn't it? In the log file for the game it says the renderer is a debug build...the game seems to be in alpha stage. Fair warning. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Alekhine's Gun set out to fill a yawning abyss left by Hitman's departure from it's original style and unfortunately failed to meet the enjoyment factor of any game in the series. It doesn't really stand up to much in the genre at all. Considering I wanted to enjoy this, the fact that I had to tap out midway into mission 2 speaks volumes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A sad disappointment, even sadder by people blindly praising it before they actually get to see how bad it is.

Sound quality, graphics, and A.I. here are at a new low. The gameplay is... okay, but, as a stealth game, this is abysmal! Stealth is made pointless by the, once again, terrible A.I., who will see you lock-picking a door and walk away, like nothing is happening at all. Stealth also has fewer options than in the original game, which came out in 2007! Also, please explain to me why you're handed NOISY guns as a reward for stealth? I'd think that if you were going by the stealthy rules, you'd like something to keep the silence, not just kill it.

Also, in case you were wondering, the story isn't too great, either.

2/10, mainly because the first 2 hours or-so aren't so terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Granted, I haven't tried out the multiplayer aspect (nor do I plan to judging by others impressions of it), but this is perhaps the most generic shooter I have come across in quite a while. The first 'warning sign' which the user will notice as to the quality of the game is that there is no real support for widescreen resolutions, despite being a widescreen option in the graphics menu. This was initially surprising due to nearly every new release game supporting it for the past two years, however a look at the graphics engine quickly explained why this so. Put simply, the game looks like it came out five years ago even on the highest settings. Trees are cleanly cut in half when shot at while identical, badly textured enemies abound. This wouldn't be an issue were it for the gameplay itself being of decent quality, however it is not. The enemy AI is as basic as that of Doom, with the enemies either standing still and shooting (and missing) at the player or running in a straight line towards them, thus making them incredibly easy targets to pick off. There is no recoil in the weapons nor are they even any interesting. Hence, it is possible to merely run forward and shoot at any enemies one encounters without worrying about taking any damage; the one time I did was from an enemy only a meter or so away. The overall feeling is that of playing any generic FPS with cheats turned on; as a result the game has a complete inability to build or maintain any tension or intensity whatsoever. That said, I did have some minor fun with it occasionally, in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way. However, the lack of any challenge in the game means that it gets incredibly boring quickly. Having reasonably enjoyed both the original DF and Black Hawk Down it seems as if this series has finally gone down the drain after circling it with Xtreme, with this one being so bad I was humoured by it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are from the 90's. Bad playstyle. The beta was bad... this is worse. For alll the Nova lovers out there... Nova said "Gotcha" for this purchase. Early Nova games were classics.... this one is too.... classically BAD! Save the $... there are way better fps games out there right now (and more coming) to spend your hard earned cash on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Few people seem to notice that this is merely a graphical update to Delta Force 2 w/ more multiplayer goodies. If you've got a laptop w/ an integrated graphics card I highly recommend it as it is a fun game and it's the closest to a BF2 or CoD4 as we're gonna get until developers start offering lowered graphics options. Glad to see a lot of indie guys doing this already. If you have a good graphics card, don't bother unless the price comes down and you just want a great, nostalgic action shooter w/ a helluva lot of folks to frag. BOTTOM LINE: Until the price comes down you'd be better off getting the original Ghost Recon from D2D. With all the add-ons it's only $15 and then you've still got all the great MODs to play with and a great community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought a wii for my kid, and he loves it. Then I bought WWII Aces. I am stuck on the first mission, where you have to sink 2 U-boats while fighting off I don't know how many fighters. Granted, I've done very little gaming, but this is frickin impossible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got this in a bundle recently, having never heard of it before. But, I like "artistic" games; I've enjoyed such works as 9.03m so I decided to try it. My total play time, from beginning to end, was a half hour. Plot aside (there is one, but it's not very well fleshed out), the execution of this game fails on every level. Optimization is poor, response is sluggish, interactive items only work when it's time in the "story" for them to work, character models look at least ten years old, voice acting is mediocre, and even the subtitles are poor (for example, "lose" is misspelled as "loose"...twice). One "stealth" section of the game is laughably (and worse, frustratingly) bad, and all of these things get in the way of what should have been an interesting and meaningful experience about alcoholism and depression.

It's hard to believe this is a 2014 release. "4PM is a high production value, cinematic experience aimed at people interested in interactive story-telling," the game's press release reads. Yes, all those things would be true --if it were 2004. It's not, and this game is far too many years too late to be worth the effort of muddling through it. What a shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Uninteresting, boring, and poorly designed/programmed. A shameful excuse for a storytelling game. Charging for this game is essentially robbery. If you need further convincing, simply watch some gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game was just down right horrible. Everything about this screams garbage. I would get locked on to stuff in the distance while trying to kill enemies right next to me. The camera was the worst of the whole game. This game should only be played if you are a trophy hunter but even then it's a maybe. They are easy to unlock but the game is a headache. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** these game **** it just **** it  it a ****up movie with ****up game this series is a complet **** up dont buy its broken that ****ing long loading screen the borring combat the  ai evereting is bad in these ****ing game i haited i play it  5 hours and non of it great this is one of the worst games ever an epic fail an epic failure don't buy this **** i hate those kind of games if u want  a great movie license game try out arkham asylum its very good game do not try this **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't believe the fake user reviews - this is a really terrible game. The game mechanics are tired, the graphics suck, and it's extremely disconcerting to "relive" Jame Bond legendary experiences.. that not only never even happened, but take place in the present and star Daniel Craig. 007 Legends is more aptly-titled "Alternate Universe James Bond in a cheap CoD/Punch-Out Clone". Skip it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I bought this game this afternoon, very amped up as I'm a sucker for stealth games. Upon beginning the game, I realised a few things. 1. This feels a lot like Hitman: Blood Money 2. This looks a lot like Walking Dead and 3. This game has managed to combine Hitman and Walking Dead, take all the life and fun from both of them and charge you $40 for it. This game has you playing as a stealthy assassin...vampire. Which is already a poor decision, the devs for this game should've noticed the irreversible pussification of vampires at the hands of the Twilight franchise. As a blood-sucker, you wield, what was said to be an arsenal of powers, is actually about 6 or 7 different powers with 3 or so passive ones, that can aid you in your missions. They are fun to use for about 3 minutes, then they just get boring. This is a grand example of a game that has a brilliant concept and so much potential, but is so poorly executed. Game play is extremely boring and repetitive there's really no motivation for you to keep playing, story is unoriginal and uninteresting, voice acting has been painfully forced with all but one or two characters so far, enemies, rather than looking around for anything suspicious, will walk back and forth between programmed routes, which is more often than not, a bloody straight line, just waiting for you to use the same 2 or 3 animations to kill them. Other than their 'routes', enemies also can't spot you if you are more than 10 metres away from them, or even better, they cannot see you if you are right around the corner...hiding behind a clear glass wall. This game is unfinished. That's really all there is to it. What's worse is the price tag. 40 dollars?! Seriously!? That's insulting. It's frustrating that I'm forced to live in a generation that creates games of this calibre and then prices them like that. My mistake was in buying it on release day, rather than wait for some reviews to come out. Hopefully, you won't make the same mistake I did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible control!  The teleporting is infuriating trying to get the right location. The actual fighting is slow and clunky.  You wind up for every punch (which is an instant kill), but while you wind up, everyone is shooting at you.  You need to play it to see how bad it truly is.

The AI is brainless, more than any other stealth game I've played. You don't even need to fight most of the time.  If you're seen, but make it through the door where the next cut-scene begins, they forget about you.

The animation and look of the game looks like an old xbox (original) game.

The sneaking element doesn't make any sense. If you go behind the enemy and do an attack to instant kill them, it doesn't make noise for others to hear (Even though it makes a huge noise for the player).  However, grabbing them to drink their blood (which makes no noise when you do it) alerts nearby enemies). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I originally believed this game would use the stealth mechanics from Bethesda Studio's Dishonored, mixed in with cel-shaded graphics like Telltale Games Walking Dead series and a vamp-based storyline and abilities. However, the game fails miserably on all of these fronts. The graphics are weak at best, the storyline rushed and weak and the worst of all, the stealth mechanics and overall game-play are inexcusably terrible. the only thing I can say is if you like the look of this game, go buy Dishonored. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DARK does one thing right: makes all other vampire games look amazing in comparison. With a broken combat system, stupid morals (throwing away the easiest and most exploitable, yet intrinsic to the 'to eat or not to eat' question of morality for vampires), horribly linear levels and just overall boring. This to date is the only game I have ever emailed Steam to send me a refund of my $40, which I unfortunately did not receive back. It is now a blight on my Steam library. Every time I scroll up to 'D', I have to be reminded of what a horrible choice I made and the waste of money that occurred on my bank account. In short: worthless trite I wish never existed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish I could say the idea was solid but the developer couldn't pull it off. But no. Despite vampires being featured prominently, the main character has supernatural powers more befitting a jedi, with a distinct weakness for... pretty much everything, really. The stealth aspect is woefully mishandled, such that if you are spotted, you might as well commit suicide. It's hard, but not the sort of hard where you feel a sense of accomplishment.

The worst thing about the entire game is that you don't feel like a vampire. Vampire Bloodlines remains the gold standard. Even the Elder Scrolls series did a better job handling vampirism, and it wasn't even a core part of the gameplay.

I recommend this game only to masochists who love vampires. And maybe Twilight fans. They deserve some suffering. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm usually very fair when it comes to games, but this game is terrible. The ONLY thing decent about it are the graphics. Now mind you, I say the graphics. NOT the animation. The graphics would get a 6/10, where as the animation for this game would get a 1/10 without a doubt. You see half a foot of empty air between your mouth (which is closed like it always is when not in dialogue) and the enemy's neck you're feeding off of.  When walking forward, if you try to go left/forward or /right forward, there's no animation between going straight and the other two options, you just instantly switch from walking one direction to the other. This isn't 1995.

Another horrible part of this game is the AI and pathfinding. Out of the first 10 enemies I encountered,  2 of them disappeared all together, yet were somehow still attacking me, then all of a sudden appeared infront/behind me again. They can't see you through glass walls, they get stuck A LOT on pretty much nothing as well.

The gameplay itself is a VERY bad knock off version of dishonored. You don't feel powerful in this game. You feel broken. Turns out it matches the game very well, as this game can def be decribed as both broken and UNFINISHED. It's obvious they either gave up and shipped this crap product or wanted to meet some deadline and decided they'd try and snag your 40 bucks without letting any review sites get their hands on it first.

I can't say this enough. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The other guy who put a 10/10 for this game is high out of his mind. It's garbage. I play most known games out there, and I wouldn't want to see anyone waste money on this. HEED ME! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has fantastic concept and potential, pretty much like vampire version of Dishonored where you get to use many special powers and tricks. However the engine of this game is horrible, I tested this game on can you run it and the result is fast but when I actually run the game the performance is terrifying, I can sense my graphic card trying so hard to maintain the FPS even after I preset graphic option to low. And the gameplay isn't so good either. You get bored pretty soon, partly because of the graphic performance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1.Funny running animation.
2.Horrible voice acting.
3.Many bugs
4.First person view when draggin a body is horrible.
5.Combat system is a total letdown.

Total waste of 40$

I like Stealth games because of that I will give 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pluses: guys, i realy tried to find some pluses, but i didn't...
Minuses: game is very hard, bad animation, bad graphics, bad stealth, bad plot, bad controll, very low budget... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of the franchise, I really tried hard to like this. It had some nifty new ideas and it worked in a lot of the lore and mythos.But it failed miserably, both as a game and as an installment in the HP franchise.A terrible control scheme, game mechanics and for some reason Hermione is voiced by a woman who would sound more at home telling me iv dialed an incorrect number and to please hang up and try again.The character animations are laughably bad. 90% of the characters seem more interested in the space 4-5 inches above Harrys head when conversing with him and at several points, the characters mouth would merge into a giant row of teeth.I tried, I honestly did, but if i have to hear that awful voice actor cry out 'THEY'RE AFTER US" or "STUPEFY" one more time, I'll bloody go crucio myself to feel less pain 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This the first Harry Potter third person shooter, I could go on on about the shoddy controls and the samey game play, so I will: Bad Things...1. The controls just aren't very good, yes pointing the wiimote as the wand was an , admittedly scarce, good idea but pressing the + button whenever you want to change spells is just annoying.  2. The Spells themselves are weird. All of them are wrong. Expelliarmas doesn't disarm you opponent, in fact it does nothing.  Impedimenta does not slow down your enemies. And just rub salt into the wound they give the hovering spell but there's just a teeny flaw-it does NOTHING! 3. The stealth levels, under the invisibility cloak  are irritating. They switch to a first person view which means, for example, you have no ideas whether your going to get through a gap or past a certain person. 4. The voice acting here is dire.  Voldemort sounds like a posh person on helium, Harry sounds like...well not Harry. Ron is the only person in fact, who sounds faintly like himself.   or looks like himself which brings me onto my next problem.5. The graphics. When the first few games for the Wii came out they weren't good but they weren't awful either but we didn't expect much considering it was a brand new console.  Now considering we're five years into it's life span there's no excuses for such crap graphics.  6. The Camera is hateful. Pointing at the edge of the screen is too slow. Surely just holding down the z button and moving the control stick would have worked better but no...Good Things...1.  It can, on occasion be fun, shooting bad wizards does lift your self-esteem let me tell you. sometimes.And that's it. That's the end of review. You can make your own decisions on whether or not to get this game but, for the love of god, don't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is even more stupid then the movie. All the action was dull and stupid, and every feature of the game was frustrating and idiotic. And the graphics weren't that good either. Even if you love Harry Potter (like my brother and sister) you will hate this game. This game is not nearly worth the cost, its not even worth the cost of the rental fee for a day or two. If you want a Harry Potter game that is still stupid, but not as stupid, i would go with Lego Harry Potter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a piece of *#(@! The worst AI I have ever seen, sound consists of three different samples, graphix look two years old, and absolutely crappy multiplayer. Just one tip for the poor soul who STILL wants to buy this--make sure you go to a store with a GOOD return policy. You'll be done in an hour-max. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst element is the need for Jackie Chan moves with the motor controls of a 2 year old. Directional controls are limited to 45 degree increments, so even approaching a item to pick-up or activate a lever can take several attempts. Story line is a waste of time. The only bright spot is a massive 3 axis environment. Problem solving elements are not interesting. Having to restart repeated dialogs, door openings, and elevator rides after being killed really adds pain. Best possible player reward would be able to immediately shoot down brainwashing speakers. Some can be shot out others not. Had to turn off the sound often. This could have been good, but you blew it big time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dear lord, this was a deeply irritating game. The graphics were only 2004, at best, and that made the gameplay a little fidgety. The enemies are dumber than oak trees. The combat system was pathetic. The voice acting was as annoying as Alvin and The Chipmunks music (Don't quote that point). There was NO story to it really, it was as if they had forgotten the storyline and needed something to fill in. I nearly got sick from all of the climbing because I had to restart so many times. It took up 10 GIGS (I would underline that rather than use caps but...) which is purely ridiculous for the lack of polish, or styling, or thought, or... I think the only remotely enjoyable thing about this was the motorcycle/mini-trains, and that is worth maybe a quarter of a point. All and all, there goes forty bucks I won't be getting back. Codemasters, Blue Omega, why? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ok this is something so bad you would be better off just throwing your money into the fireplace to use as firewood. when that is a better use of money then buying this game you know something is awful
pros: well it is 1000 times better then the first iron man game which had nothing good
cons: really short, bad gameplay, single player WTF, gamecube graphics, terrible CGI, war machine had more useful stuff for me so playing as IRON MAN was pointless, bland voice acting, story 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply awful. Why? Two reasons, graphics are awful, controls are worse. The only gameplay is either shaking your hand rapidly to advance or random QTEs.

Don't buy this *ahem* "game" as it's called. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, being honest, I'm just doing this because I need a negative review for a game.  But yeah, the gameplay is shallow and unabsorbing, the graphics are vomit-inducing, and there's about two days worth of casual gameplay.  So, in other words, you can beat it in an afternoon and still have time to go to the movies or something.  Seriously though, why on God's green Earth would anyone actually like this game? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well what can I say about this game. Buy it for your 3 year old! It should have had a maximum age limit of 7 not minimum! Very disappointed its not the console version. Activision what were you thinking of :( Took it straight back to HMV following day after completing it in six hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. The only good part was the amusing voice-over in the tutorial. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No, no and no! I downloaded demo and what I get? Crap. Okey, this game is for the kids, but I think this game is too easy for kids. Luckily, I have Xbox and I buy Spider-Man 2 for Xbox. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a piece of junk. I mean, really, why did they even bother releasing it? I'm sure that even publishers Activision are aware that this game is crap. I'm furious because I'm tricked. I bought this game after readinga review of the console version. I was ripped. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrific. I was very excited when I bought this game. I was 11 or 12 at the time... not exactly sure. And even then, I knew this game was total crap. I couldn't even get past the 3rd level... I was way too bored with it already. A sad excuse for a game. The only redeeming quality is the amusing voice-over for the tutorial 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i hate hate hate with all my heart the people who made this game.
Gothic 1 & 2 was an excellent game.
Its a shame how my favorite saga its a now a garbage  total sadness. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thankyou so much for ruining one of my favourite TV shows with this piece of sh*t. This game already had a good plot as its straight from the TV series, but that just isn't enough as the gameplay is about as enjoyable as a nosebleed.Please for your own sake stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is problably the worst one i've played so far on my ps3 it is graphically reminiscent of a game known as "the great escape" if you find yourself in the position where your gonna binge buy this game rent it and spend that money on beer like I should have. I bought this gem a week ago on it's release date and it's not even trading in for 20 bucks save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game tries to be epic, yet i can't seem find it satisfying in any way. I was looking for a simple shooter, and instead found an unfinished product. The sounds is deafening, not because of the atmosphere created, but by improper output, often just cackling. Character models are poorly drawn, with horrible clipping problems. Controls are either too loose or too tight, no middle ground. Really wish I had just saved the money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Giving this game a rating of 5 out of 10 is ridiculous! I was being very, very generous giving it a 2. The game was so dark that I had to completely turn up the brightness on my big screen TV to barely see the enemy, but it didn't keep them from blowing me away. The check points were too few and far between with no way to save progress without getting to a check point. The AI might not be the smartest I have seen, but they are much better shots. The aiming is clunky. The weapons don't carry over sop don't horde your ammo. There just isn't anything I can think of to say about this game that is positive. I was really looking forward to this game and what I thought was a great premise for an interesting game. I even preordered it thinking that there was no way that it could be a bad game. I WAS WRONG!!! Turning Point turned my stomach and is to date the only Playstation game I have ever played that I dreaded wasting my time playing it to completion  It is also the only game I have owned that ever locked up my Playstation 3. This happened on four seperate occassions. Do yourself a favor and don't even consider this game for purchase or rent unless you feel like your life needs a large dose of disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute garbage barely worth the 150 character minimum to review. What on Earth were they thinking when they released this mess of a game? It is far from ready for release. How dare they rush out crap just to make a movie tie-in date when the game is almost entirely broken. BLAGH! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible game, Innovative idea, but seeming as though you are more likely to get hit by lighting then be the Archlord its hardly worth the price, The graphics are horrible, even on the highest settings you can still see individual pixels on the floor, Flawed chat system, repetitive grinding for levels, Unoriginal character design and awkward movement make this the flop of 2006, Such a great idea wasted, And for the money their asking each month? Go buy World of Warcraft, City of heroes or Eve Online. The game also favours those who have more money, as the people on the higher monthly amount get benefits over those paying less. Noone can champion such a poorly designed, Programmed and thought out game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing really new here. Another Korean'esque mouse click fest. If it wasn't for open pvp you could fall asleep at the keyboard and still lvl. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The initial section of the game is generic grind-em-up, and with higher level players obviously camping the starting city for easy kills. The game didn't hold my attention for longer than a few hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A bare-bones grinding experience. This game favors only the most dedicated player, but between the start to the ascension to the throne of the Archlord (which is unlikely for your Average Joe), you're going to be bleeding your eyes out grinding, grinding, grinding and doing some more grinding. This mediocre title clearly had a good reason to go Free. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing the game for a long time, I decided to drop the game.

The game has many flaws that become apparent once you start playing. While everything seems new and with great ideas, it is poorly done. Enemies take way too long to beat and follow a certain pattern. By no means that makes the battle easy, as a slight recolored enemy means another pattern to discover.

Story is original and very well done, there's character growth and the animation in general is good. But, that's it.  Maps are huge, but, you will never see either enemies on map or npc's. it's just the character "running" to some place. And here is where the game seems rather rushed, enganging battles should not take more than 5 minutes, or the game will feel rather bland.

Scenarios aren't that good, if there was some more interaction, it would be better. Music isn't good and there's no option for Japanese voices, plus, the lip sync wasn't done good enough, as some characters keep moving the lips but there's no sound.

Some characters follow the norm and are somewhat interesting, but, after a while, there's no motivation to continue playing, as events become foreseeable.

all in all, the game feels both rushed and lacking 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of Final Fight's 1 and 2 during the SNES days, but Streetwise just killed the franchise and I think it's time for a reboot. C'mon Capcom, bring back both Final Fight and Darkstalkers the way they were. Remember Street Fighter IV? Take some notes and figure something out for new ways to bring the "f" back in fighting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a rip off! The 'developers' of this game should be lying off the coast of New Jersey along with Big Pussy. The game play is so simple it defies belief but I'd forgive even that if the player control was any good. The only thing to recommend it is the dialogue and the fact that cast members lended their voices. I'm giving it 5 for the fact it's an official Sopranos game and -3 for the game itself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Liking a game is one thing, but this mess isn't in anyway shape or form a 10. Those reviews are fake and most likely planted. Confusing missions, too many mini games and abysmal graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That anyone could rate this game above a 5 or describe any part as awesome makes me feel like I was sent a dud disk, a Videodrome alike attempt to crush my mind and drain every feeling of joy out of a franchise I love.

I played Star Trek with a friend in couch-coop, a mode that seemed perfectly suited to the Spock/ Kirk interplay of the new movies.  There were certainly a few sequences of dialogue that made me chuckle, but most of the laughs came from the atrocious script and wooden character models.

Perhaps it's because this is a game of a film, but I expect film quality dialogue, film quality cut scenes, and film quality story.  This game delivers none of this.  Characters will stride across rooms, rotate on the spot and deliver their lines like a group of stage players.  Lip syncing fails with alarming regularity (strangely, more regularly on Karl Urban's normally well played McCoy) leaving the crew looking like stuffed mannaquins.

The story deals with the Gorn, they of the Star Trek background.  What's odd though is that these Gorn are nothing like those protrayed in Star Trek up 'til now, and have gained a backstory that's entirely at odds with everything written about them so far.  The writers would have been better to have created a new race, rather than invent such a contrived origin as they managed here.

Texture quality seems to have been chopped at the last second, and more often than not I was confronted with disturbing levels of banding on skyboxes.  We're not quite at holodeck technology, but it'd be nice to have a bit of immersion from the graphics  this game reminded me of Playstation 2 shocker Driv3r more often than not.

I mentioned laughing at the game, and it was the recurrence of odd bugs that brought the most entertainment.  Ragdoll bodies shooting across the level, Kirk and Spock glitching into each other when opening doors, enemies running into walls (or even just ignoring you), and more often than not entire sequences failing to initialise.  Early in the game, a boss collapsed to the floor having failed to initialise a scripted sequence that would allow us to proceed.  A swift checkpoint restart was all that could fix this.  Nevermind that it's impossible for Player Two to enjoy a coop experience over two sittings, my chum was annoyed to find that all his progress has been reset after we began playing again  no achievements for you my friend.

It would be hard to finish without mentioning the ending.  Don't worry, there are no spoilers  there's nothing to spoil!  All you get for completing the game is a daringly short shot of the Enterprise warping away, coupled with a voiceover on the credits.  Did the developers plan for something more, but find themselves short of time?  Either way, I don't expect to have to suffer because they can't manage their time properly.

I'd be remiss to mention the sound, if only to say how unremarkable it is.  Weapons manage to feel like little more than nerf guns, and the soundtrack rapidly begins to grate with its overuse of the films' leitmotifs.  Special mention must go to a segments in one of the earlier episodes that my gaming companion and I both realised sounded more like Star Wars than Star Trek.  Perhaps the composer had as little interest in the subject matter as the rest of the team.

This is a bad game, and it's galling how much it wastes an excellent subject.  The endlessly repeated on-rails segments will haunt me, and the commendation system barely manages to encourage replayability.  If you see this for £5 in a bargain bin, it's maybe worth a punt, at full price it's only going to disappoint. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nam-co employes or people who give this piece of crap a 7-10 are scum I respect people that actually genuinely like the game now the score is evened up fairly even though I think the game would've actually have gotten a 4 out of ten despite my review also the namco employees are acting like scum. This is my first review and it may seem suspicious but whatever let the namco employees act like brats and call me and everyone who wanted to even out the score anyways basically you heard all the complaints buggy as hell, mediocre graphics, **** coop and launch, etc. I advise you to avoid this horrible game also this is the rating I would've regardless of the child brats, sorry to beat a dead horse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Look, if you are somehow affiliated with the company and shilling good reviews on Metacritic, face it champ, you are a cheap sellout.  This game is EXACTLY what we've all feared: a shoddy knock-off of a venerable IP.  Congrats, you threw some bones (heh) at the original cast and then skimped on game mechanics, graphics, and story...i.e. the only things that matter.  And, oh dear V'ger...the cutscenes...every 2 minutes.  Oh really...another turbolift ride?  Did you guys not notice how Mass Effect fixed this obvious BS?  I would say, honestly, that if you're a hardcore Trekkie...please wait until this is >$20.  It's simply a substandard, lazy game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stop lying to consumers Namco Bandai.  The fact that you delayed review copies, denying that Co-op doesn't work and having to create fake accounts on Metacritic in order to combat the negative press reviews this game is about to get is crap. Incredibly unprofessional. Its again another sub par, below average movie licensed title with third person action we've seen time and time again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

cant play online! piece of crap! sort it out!.... graphics are not that bad but i met many glitches.. not worth full price.. license games should cost 30$

btw stop creating fake accounts to boost the score!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shills. Shills everywhere. Shady devs doing shady stuff. To all of you who paid for this game, I urge you to get refunds or do chargebacks with your banks if possible. Do not support this kind of shady behavior. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very sceptical about this game, and now all my worst nightmares have become true. This game is horrid. Gameplay: 1 Voice acting: 1 Story: 1 Concept: 1 Art style: 1
I have run these points through a complicated and thorough score aggregation process and determined that this game conclusively deserves a score of 2/10.

Thank you for your attention. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could compare this game to aliens CM I actually got pretty exited though not as much as for aliens
it's set in the future  though not the future of gaming  they have aliens they both felt a little unfinished
AND THEY BOTH SUCK though to aliens credit at least the co-op works 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well where to start?  I love Star Trek, and you'd think a game with a good writer on board, and solid voice acting from all the cast of the reboot would be good.  Unfortunately it isn't.  It's clear that this game was released in a highly unfinished state.

It has less polish than a dusty old cabinet in a shed, and more bugs then the insect house at Chester Zoo.  Allow me to elaborate.  The game is clearly designed to be played with a human co-op partner.  If you have to rely on the AI, you're in for a lousy time.

-  Your AI character (Spock in my case) will very often get confused by simple things such as walls and just run into them
-  When ordered to unlock a door or hack something he will very often just stand there
-  On one occasion I was downed in a gun battle.  Did Spock heal me?  No he just stood there looking and I had to restart and entire section
-  The jumping mechanics are a joke
-  The graphics would have been an embarrassment as a 360 launch title

I honestly don't know how anyone can rate this game above 3 stars.  It claims to have 'Mass Effect' style gameplay.  That's a huge insult to Bioware and anyone involved with the Mass Effect universe.  This game does not even deserve to lick Commander Shepard's boots.

Truly awful stuff.  If you don't believe me, rent before you buy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Games based on movies will always suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A complete Joke,This game is confusing and the graphics are just bad.
it is not worth the money and the game is boring,uninteresting and just bad in my opinion 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible at all angles. Can't handle the game it gives me headaches! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WOW. Never have I seen such a mildly unique game be so brutally raped by terrible producing and awful buggy gameplay. This game looks like crap and plays like crap. A shame as it had some potential. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring zzzzzzzz BOE - BOE - BOE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good idea, but boring levels and limited game play and robot customizing ability make this game suck... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are fun for about 2 minutes. other than that, totally pointless and boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoy killing teddy bears with a variety of weapons you might get twenty minutes out of Naughty Bear before it becomes apparent just how simplistic and repetitive the gameplay is.

Don’t bother with this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA, EA, EA... what is this? I actually thought EA would surprise us... boy was I wrong.

Pros:
-The net, not the rim, just the net
-ESPN scoreboard and presentation overlays
-Halftime and postgame show "Wired Up" bit

Cons:
-Everything else

...Thank God for 2K 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

such good
very basketball
much next gen
buy

Just to be clear, I'm lying. This is one of the worst games ever created, and you should avoid it like plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played this at a friends house, couldn't believe how terrible it actually was. Anyone who says different is either trolling or desperately trying to justify their purchase. 2K is where it's at, period. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Asphalt 3D is A HORRIBLE,GLITCHY GAME,Don't Try This At all. 2 1/2 Out of 10, 33.8%Out of 100%,Don't Rent this Either It Is a Bad Need For Speed Clone 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very terrible mostly once you're driving through each street you can't even see most of the cars from somewhat far away. It is terrible, annoying and and always jolts the screen and flickers. I'd give it at least a 1.5/ 5  not even a 1. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A game that somewhat looked promising turned out to be a nightmare of a game. This game is as bad as the reviews state. This game offers some sort of aerial combat with a dumptruck full of bugs that severely hurt this game chances of even being remotely successful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is for sure the most dismal theme park game yet. Coasters are flexible but always a big chore. The rides are glitchy and you can't even choose where the entrance and exit are placed. Paths are terrible so is modular building sucks. One good thing about the game is really just the management but you can't see through that when the guest's animations stink and having to place a building just to hire staff is terrible. Don't buy this because in about a year you'll see this in the dollar store for 99 cents 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the f*ck happened? This game couldn't of been bad if the glitches weren't everywhere, but they are everywhere! It is gay and a game like this I hyped, but the end result is this bull **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is very weak, Compared to the last 2 Transformers games, this one is embarrassing.  We need another Transformers game on next gen from highmoon. The only thing redeemable about this game is Highmoons FoC and WfC assets....the earth stuff,  supper unfinished.  do yourself a favour pick up Fall of Cybertron and war for cyberton.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Say what u will I beat it in 1 hour dude, yea I have played war for cybertron and fall, and they still beat out this game any day campaign and multiplayer wise. PS3 transformers looks a whole lot better than this game on ps4.. The story is garbage , the characters they stole from previous games are nothing new, and the new characters look like they should even be in a transformers game. The graphics are like playing on the damn ps2. I am a big transformers fan and I even played it again to see if I could get into it and I just can't,,,,,,,,it is a huge letdown and it is what it is, a rushed out game to get my 60 bucks into they're pockets,,, 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hate when the makers of a game make comments like Goyo grub must be doing. This game stinks and isn't any fun. It's clunky, slow, and there is no reason for it to be a "DC heroes" game. Save your money for something else! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm glad I rented this game, because Gearbox were lazy jerking off while making this game. This game took like what? Under 5 years to make?!?! So, the gameplay is just bland as hell and the hitmarkers are just weird. The storyline takes place after the movie "Aliens" and it's an ok storyline to take place after Aliens (the movie) The graphics, oh gosh, the graphics are like playing a Wii game on a PS3 System, Seriously?!?!?! 2013 and developers are this lazy?!?!  The game is also buggy as hell, and is just really terrible. But with the customization with guns, attachments and more can make the gun whatever you want so that's nice what Gearbox did. The multiplayer is decent, you have TDM, Extermination, Survivor and Escape. You can pick Xeno's between Solider, Spitter and Lurker. The multiplayer is actually fun and can make you rage a bit, but it's actually better then Campaign. So, what I think about this game is about a 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is nothing worse then being conned. And that's exactly what happened to me  I was conned into buying this game based on 11 minuets of supposedly "in game footage" released by the devs in 2011 showing a vibrant and gripping game. The graphics where rich, the story looked inviting and action in it sent adrenalin flowing though my veins. Come to 2013 and the game is finally here. I planned an all-nighter to finally play a game I've spent years looking forward to. Palms sweating, heart racing I clicked "Play"  and that's right about where all the fun ended. What I got was more then a far cry from what I sold me into buying this game. In fact everything I was looking forward to that I had seen in "Gameplay footage" never appeared. The rich graphics were replaced by flat polygons with low-res textures slapped on. The story was nothing more then a overly vague and childish journey to help NPC's that I cared nothing about; and the Adrenaline rush I was promised was replaced by slow ooze of Melatonin (The sleep hormone for those of you who failed biology) as the action consisted of nothing more then effortlessly gunning down wave after wave of predictably stupid A.I enemies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game had its ups and downs. The graphics weren't that great. I would say for taking a long time to create this game was good, but they didn't make it a game were we could stand up and applaud. Their was twitches in the game. They shouldn't of added when you fight he humans that sucked. Another thing I probably would of enjoyed it more if they didn't even make this game. So if anybody wants this game then probably don't buy this game it was dumb. The storyline to this was horrible to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I ALSO just registered to leave my first score here... The first thing I am disappointed is that Steam doesn't do refunds... £29.99  months of anticipation and what do we get....?! THIS?? Did they mix the beta files with the supposed "final release"  or what the hell happened?!
The rest of comments build a proper picture of what this game is really like.
I just went on it's facebook page and it is full of dissatisfaction as well. Some people defending it for SOME reason, but they can't be the fanboys right..?
Like all of us who have bought this crap, I just feel insulted and very disrespected as a customer/gamer/Aliens fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is nearly everything recycled from another game? Zack's shop, animations, places to go -- all recycled from Xtreme 2. Of course the game doesn't have as many bikinis as X2, and no Jet-Ski which is replaced by a stupid rock climbing game that only a moron would fail at. The casino is the same boring lifeless character portraits. Nothing new to make this overpriced AND JAPANESE ONLY game worth it. The models just look like rebuffed DOA5 characters. It's a grab at your cash and a LAZY effort for Team NINJA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While some elements are half decent- switching to a painfully low amount of characters with your helper is a better inclusion to the game, its terrible graphics, boring gameplay and complete lack of character makes this one to stay clear of, while there are many good DS games, this is another awful licenced DS game, and one of few games I would only buy for a really low price, if only to sell it for a higher one. Succeeds in offering something life draining- truly awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What is this trash? Is this called a "game" this is a disaster. I miss the old days when ninja gaiden was a good franchise on the nintendo NES, Hope this abysmal release put an end for the good of this decadent franchise, this games have one of the worst gameplay mechanics and animations i have ever seen
I recommend the people to stay away from this game, this game is so bad that even the professional reviewers give it a bad score. Don't fell bad, hope in the future we can get some good ninja games, but this one, is one of the WORST ninja games ever made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to review the PC version a short while after this, but damn it. This is one of the worst PC ports I have seen. I'm tired so let me put this short, if you have a Xbox 360 DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
'Nuff said 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

sonic 06...ugghhhh. this game is balls sonic controls like he did in the other 3d sonic games but slower and given a ton of glitches and downgrades compared to previous games. in certain parts of levels he DECIDES to run fast and these levels control even worst than before such as you cannot move in midair. plus the level design is horrid. tails controls like he did in adventure but his flight is more stiff and during flight tails will randomly loose all momentum and fall.knuckles and rouge control like they did in adventure 2 but they are much slower. tails and rouge both use bombs to attack but they are next to worthles. well at least knuckles can still attack =). knuckles and rouge also have a glitch that when they are climbing walls they get stuck and you will be suck for a long time. shadow controls like sonic but slower and has some worthless attacks to replace useful attacks that sonic had. omega or e - 123 is goddamn game breaking. by mashing the hover button you can fly wherever you want and did i mention he runs faster than sonic? silver is pretty interesting. he can telepathicly pick thiungs up and he can hover for a limited time. but in this game however good comes with a price and that price is he is slow. amy is the worst character in the game. she is like adventure where she already was bad but now... she is to bad to explain. the only character worth playnig as is blaze who is fast and is pretty much what sonc should have been. too bad she has few levels. this game has horrendis load times. be sure to have a snack with you while playing this game. this game however has 1 redeming factor which is the soundtrack. go to truesonic1's youtube chanel to see what i mean. if you have never played this you should pity those who have 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game I am about to review is the worst game I have ever played. In 2006, Sega needed Sonic team to quickly make a game for the new generation of gaming for the PS3 and 360 for the 06 holiday season. The game is so broken that the PS3 version was delayed for early 2007, but NOTHING was fixed for this game. The story is that Sonic falls in love with a princess that can destroy the world if she cries. BEASTIALITY FTW. The story eventually becomes repetitive as the princess is always getting kidnapped and rescued. Then they add in 2 other stories where Shadow the Hedgehog must battle a recolor from Deviantart and Silver must save his world 200 years in the future. Shadow's gameplay is like Sonic except it focuses on a combination of speed and combat. Shadow's gameplay is not really good, as there are as many bugs and glitches as Sonic's. And then there is Silver who is a psychic hedgehog who randomly throws objects across the stage. I got this game in the bargain bin for $10 but it was not even worth that. If you even think about buying this game, you will regret it for the rest of your life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I opened the box. I was very excited. I have played a demo of this game and I was looking forward to it's fast moving levels. But instead I am served with a dull boring game. Right away when you have control of Sonic the Frame rate of the game begins to slow the game down at very random moments. The city looks like something out of the original Dreamcast version of Sonic Adventure. Even the first action level uses the "whale is chasing me " scenario from that as well. With the power that the PS3 can provide I was disappointed to see that SONIC TEAM did not take advantage of it. Rent if you must but dont be like me and waste your money on this mundane game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played the game all the way through, and it sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If anyone  sees this game on the shelves at any store, DO NOT BUY THIS. This is one of the worst games of all time.  There are several glitches, unfinished stages and graphics and mostly The Story 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

[ Edited on 2/2/2017 ] Sonic the Hedgehog on the PlayStation 3... before we can get started with the many flaws that made this game a failure, we have to experience how hard this should have been for the Sonic Team if this wasn't rushed to selected marketplaces. Sure, there were great things about it, but that amount of great things is the rarity of a blue moon. Playing this without discovering a bug is nearly impossible and will nearly kill your playtime in pieces. Not only are the glitches the only thing terrible about this. It's the unbearable relationship between human and hedgehog. I'm very glad Elise doesn't appear in any more installments of the franchise but it makes me want to grab a team to make a spin-off game about her only. Silver's introduction was nearly rough and bumpy. Again, you can't deny that the music here is great, but this music can't save a broken game anyways so why bother. Hopefully, the Sonic Team has learned their lessons after this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story is DISGUSTING and uncomfortable. The controls ain't so bad. The game is a glitchfest from start to finish. The graphics look good. The levels are bad cause the glitches. This game sucks!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I'm not a big sonic fan, I enjoyed some of the old games but they are a lot of them that are just awful...This is one of them and it's surely the worst one I played.

The story is terrible, it's long and boring and there is a lot of times where it doesn't make any sense.
The characters are equally as terrible, I never liked sonic as a character but here he's just so freaking annoying and The other characters are honestly just bland.

How is the gameplay? Well it's terrible, everything in this game is a glitchy, broken, nonsensical mess !
Just by playing the first level, you can see that this game is unfinished.

In conclusion, stay away from this game, but you probably knew that already 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played all PK games and like other say this one is a notch better than Resurrection - at least i have not encountered any bugs but still not worthy of time other than training for competition. I got through the first level and it felt OK - good to recall some fun days with razor cube. In the second level all of the game is reduced to running PK weapon in "Pain" mode (the spinning blades) and chop hundreds of weak enemies into crout. The fighting areas are small (smaller than most deathmatch levels) and you don't get enough ammo so very soon your only weapon is the Painkiller. I don't have as much time to waste anymore so I gave up on level 2. If like me you miss the good old original then just replay it and don't waste your time on this new one. I hope the five bucks I spent on PK Redemption will work as decisive vote and someone does a truly worthy sequel to this fantastic franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game kind of sucks. It's literally just a bunch of multiplayer maps crammed full of enemies. The original Is far better. Overdose is better. At the very least, it's shorter then Resurrection, which was possessed of painfully long and poorly-designed levels. But Redemption adds literally nothing new to the mix. There are no new enemies and no new weapons, and the maps themselves are exceedingly bland. There isn't even any dialogue, and the cutscenes are just text scrawls with still art of the characters. Given it's release so long after that of the original Painkiller, it kind of just feels like a weak attempt to make more money off the original's legacy and frankly, it's kind of insulting how mediocre it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game, let me explain why:

Graphics: 4/10, this is 2015, please try harder.
Gameplay: no plot, no storyline, Ok I knew that going in, BUT ; It's  not even fun, gets repetitive after the first 5 minutes.
Getting shot offscreen, /golfclap.

the FBI should plant trackers into the game and fish out all of the psychos playing it, any normal teen/adult won't enjoy this game after the initial couple of kills.

Sadistic/ worthless game. /waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't find its sadism especially disturbing or controversial: I'm thirty years old and I've been playing violent games and watching violent movies for decades. I found the sadism just plain pointless. I didn't add to the gameplay at all. I did like the dark, grimy atmosphere, which is why the game gets 2/10 from me.

The sadistic nature of the character isn't explained. No backstory, no character development.

I found the gameplay bland and repetitive and entirely lacking in innovation. And the forced media attention through its controvery didn't make me very receptive: this is the equivalent of a straggling wannabe-star's sex tape. Famous by all means possible.

I didn't finish the game. A lot more could have been made out of it.

I don't understand why so many claim that this game is the next Postal. That's just wrong. Postal's message was: the game is only as violent as the player is. It was very much possible to play Postal without decapitating people or urinating in their mouthes. Postal cleverly exposed its critics hyprocrisy, because the game was only horrific and controversial if the player played it that way. Hatred is completely different: it is entirely impossible to progress without playing sadistically. There is no clever message in Hatred.

It was a waste of time in my opinion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Basic shooter that gets boring really fast.
Graphics would look ok on mobile, but are sub-par for PC these days.
The game relies solely on the ultra-violence theme, but any shocking impact it may have fades away during the first minutes of play as soon as the game's dull and repetitive nature kicks in.

Give this one a miss and try one of the many good twin stick shooters out there instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very mediocre and boring game. Stylish graphics looks pretty good. But the gameplay is just awful. Not as brutal as I had expected. It didn't even reach the level of postal 2, which was released 12 years ago. This game is completely failure, because it can't offer nothing but violence,and even with that it can't cope. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Atrocious cesspool of cr@p! I preordered this, thought i’ll have a good violent AO rated fun in one of my favorite style, iso-shooter.
No pros. I give 2/10. 1 for actually working, 1 for the OK graphics and the credits music. Not my style of score but good to hear.
Now the cons.
1 AO rating??? What for? The Postal games or Manhunt(1) were not AO and this do? Those games were violent as this or even much more. Except those were highly enjoyable. Hatred is practically Postal(1) with modern graphics and broken game mechanics, and extremly boring as well. Maybe the several kind of death? Absolutely no! Shots and headshots, some kicking, THAT’S ALL! Play Squishy the Pig or (poor) Eryi’s action for wide variety of deaths. Or Manhunt of course.
2) Graphics are OK, as it’s the good old UE3. But the annoying under-contrasted black-white filter does not help. The idea is ok, but it’s somehow not works. Those night levels and the default white cross-hair made me insane. Many times simply lost the cross-hair, and took 10-20 seconds to find it again. Many time happened that i even did not see people on screen. Night levels and black suited civilians are fun to distinguish!
3) Music is OK, and fortunately it’s not played ingame, that would be atrocious. The sounds, however terrible. Weapon sounds are like toy weapons. No dynamics at all. Human cries and shouts are extremly repetitive, and after 10 minutes you’d better mute. It’s not fun to hear the same monologues 20 times in a row.
4) The weapons themselves are weak, inaccurate and unsatisfying. Even poor civilians need 2-3 bullets, but SWATs and soldiers swallow 1-2 full clips!!!! before they die. I’ve found the basic pistol to be the most usefull wep as it’s the most accurate (later why). The shotgun is absolutely useless in your hands. Melee range only, good on civilians, but against any other it’s a suicide. A soldier needs like 3 very close shotgun shots to die, and of course he will shot you in the time you do it. You will loose 50-75% (on easy) of your life in the progress, and there is nothing you can do to avoid. Of course in the hand of foe the shotgun is more than deadly (later why).
5) Enemies shooting from outside of the screen. This is a joke! Any who enjoys this must be mentally deceased. And when i say outside i mean FAR outside, without any indications where the damage is coming from. The minuscule radar is your only source of information, but that’s just useless, beacuse it’s so small, and many times showing inaccurate positions. There is this right-click far-view mode, but that’s painfull to use, and must be exactly know where you wanna look (and shoot) at. Cannot be used for searching as it’s so fast and twitchy, that you’ll soon puke on the monitor.
6) Of course the enemies accuracy is godly even from 2 screens away using shotguns. Your best choice to fight back from that distance is the pistol because of its accuracy. Don’t forget the whole game is about aimbot hitscans, so you cannot do too much to avoid damage, it’s all calculated by a random generator and it’s not on your side! Even easy is a joke. There is actually two ways to lessen the generator output. First the avoid move, good only for escaping, or the simple crouch. Crouch is fair as it lessens the damage to a level where you won’t die in 3 seconds and you can even shoot back. All good until a shotgunner comes in and sprinkle the area. Hurray!
7) The game cheats as hell.There is no way to play hide and seek. Everyone (even civilians) see you through walls. No sneak attacks of any sort. If there is a pixel wide clear view between you and the foe they shoot. They shoot always first. A-L-W-A-Y-S! Funny, eh?
8) There is no way to tell from the animations when someone is dying or simply hit and will recover soon. Somehow funny to see it on civilians, that after some death agony they cry and run away. But it’s more than deadly with the gunned crowd, when one is starting to shoot you from behind after you left him assuming he is dead.
9) Healing is only possible through executions. Who to be executed is again a random generator output. Sounds fun in an AO game! Well it’s not! Tell me how to heal yourself when 7 SWATs around you, shooting precisely at you. Even with crouching your life decreasing fast, and when crouching you move like a slug, no way to escape or go to an ’executable’. Even if you somehow reach one (the generator loved you) and the timeframe is still on till it’s executable, so you push the button. . .and die. As execute animation done standing still, so no crouching bonus. Nuff.
10) After a while i reached a level (still easy difficulty, don’t forget!) where in every minute 1-2 new car coming in with full squads of policemen and SWATs, INFINITELY. This is where i ragequit this abomination.
11)Oh yes, DO NOT USE CARS! They are impossible to steer, and if been shot, it will explode in 3 seconds and you’ll die with it.
F@ck this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hatred is definitely a game made solely for the purpose of gaining popularity due to the controversy created by the nature of this game.  There is nothing special about this game except the fact it's about a psychopath who's goal is to kill as many innocent civilians as possible.  Like seriously,  who in their right mind sits down and thinks up these game ideas and actually thinks it's a smart idea.  I would never recommend this game to anyone,  definite waste of money and there are plenty other games out there whose developers deserve the support from the gamer community.  Only someone with a sick and twisted mind would enjoy a game like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what is all the controversy around, this game is just some generic shoot-em all game that is boring as hell, has nothing good, interesting or innovative about it. so you go and shoot people, wow...... what an interesting concept for a game, one of the most idiotic games that without the controversy they would never get any attention, from a game perspective alone, without all of the other nonsense this game is just a bad game with mediocre gameplay and no reason to exist. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As "The Hitler of Video Games", I am very disappointed wit how tha game turned out. Awful controls, violence you'd normally see in any average M-rated game, and nothing to go "Oh sh*t" over. The World's Blandest Game Award goes to Hatred. Hopefully this is the only game Destructive Creations make, because now their future is done for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's 1987 all over again! This game is terrible. It feels like I am playing an isometric shooter back in the mid 80s when I had a C64. Played 10 minutes of this cow dung. Movement with WASD keys is a total joke, so is this entire game. Thanks for NOTHING. Note to devs: Wake up, it's 2015. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is purely being sold, based on its controversy, which carried it to tons of free publicity by our idiotic games media of 2015. If you like games where you just go around mindlessly killing tons of people, there are tons of better games to play than this. Take your pick of any FPS, Grand Theft Auto series, shoot-em-up, or anything else involving killing massive amounts of enemies. The $20 price tag may be slightly welcoming, but trust me, it's not worth it. This game is frustratingly hard (and unfair) at times, has no clever or witty dialogue (they assume it's clever), and next to no gameplay outside of shoot, shoot, shoot. It gets boring after awhile, trust me.

Only reason it doesn't get a 0 is because the physics engine is actually kind of neat. You can blow up parts of buildings with explosives, and the lighting on fire and police sirens are quite nice, but outside of that, everything else is pretty blah. Again, this game sold purely based on its controversy (what they were hoping) and the gameplay was very botched because they probably expected it to sell well based on its extensive hype and media coverage (that they didn't even need to pay for!). For a first game from a brand new company, it's okay, but after hearing non-stop outcry over boycotting this game, I expected a lot better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too bad the trailer is better than the game—and for a game, that's quite the achievement!—because that's not a game for adults, that's not a game as we know it today. No story. Repetitive as hell. Empty soulless uninteresting protagonist. Everything taken up to eleven doesn't make a game insanely enjoyable, it just hits Poe's law at high speed. The poor poor innocents could be whatever you imagine them to be—pack of gums, stupid running bunch of pixels…—because they're as empty as the protagonist. If you want to be thrilled with the killing of innocents, you have to make the player feel that they're innocents and don't deserve to die in pain. But here… Well, without story, that's hard to pull off. Anyway. Two points: one for graphs, one for bollocks—too bad it's not enough nowadays, huh? If I wanted to get off on killing virtual innocents, I'd actually play anything but Hatred. Sorry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hatred..most violant game ever..i dont think so
Hatred is most worst Optimization game ever..yes it is

just walk and kill..no missions..no story..
just repitive..stuttering..fighting with optimization

one of the worst games..

i give it 2 just for lighting in the game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Peoples' HATRED for this game amuses me.
Am I rite guize?
...
guize?
(Seriously though, it's not a very good twin-stick shooter and all the fuss is only based on controversy alone) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a shame about this game! It looked good and promised so much but unfortunately marred by an early release. Single player (as advertised) is not working, M/player portal is tricky to say the least. May improve with 3-4 patches (of even 34 patches) but it's days could be numbered with upcoming competition if its not fixed soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has a very good potential but it feels like the development team stoped developing it and left all the bugs and graphics problems you won't have fun with this game you will be annoyed as hell becuse of all the bugs and lack of control. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible , horrible, horrible. And to think, I was looking forward to this game for months. Soldner: Secret Wars should have remained a secret. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A really bad game! It looked good first, but after a few minutes you realize how bad is it! Horrible, horrible, horrible! Do not try it, read the reviews first! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WTF is this   Max Payne  Swaggy kidz edition ?!
No wonder, most games based on movies are s**tty
The game was transformed into a cover-based FPS and the graphics are mediocre 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

probably by far one of the most disappointing game ever from the harry potter games. Yes, the graphics were great however, that is the only thing that was great.  this game was just like call of duty but instead of shooting each other with guns, wands are used to attack each other. No puzzle solving, no hidden areas, no nothing. The collectibles were freaking useless, all you get was music and a collection of characters. This game did not even let you roam around like the previous games. Huge letdown for an ending of this game! Honestly the hp games were great from 1-3 and it just went downhill from there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stay away from this one guys. I am a Ghostbusters freak, and loved the previous game, but this is just an awful mess. First, you can't play multiplayer online, you have to play local on the PC, getting 3 other people huddled around a computer is not the best playing environment. The game is the same all the way through, and it's not much of a challenge, getting boring quickly. At even a small price of $10 i expected way more. The Ghostbusters look terrible in the "comic cut scenes" and are almost unrecognizable. I wish I could get my money back on this one, at the very least I can say I own it, making my Ghostbuster game collection complete. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Again? Monster JAM is a big competence, great, funny and savage, but the games are a big disaster, and this new version of Monster JAM is not the exception. The gameplay is awful, the graphics are horrible, the monster cars look awful. Terrible game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never once thought I would say this about anything Digimon, but stop. Just stop. Bandai is ruining the good name of Digimon. The battle system is ridiculously under thought and the desire to keep playing is nonexistent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its Boring, repetitive, and glitchy. Everything about the game screams mediocre. People said multiplayer is the game's saving grace but it's only fun for an hour or two. Save your money and buy phantom pain. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nope.
Devil's Third has a lot of good ideas, but none of them are executed well.  The "high paced action" is nothing but a mess, the graphics look like they belong on the Playstation 2, and the single player campaign is one of the most terrible experiences i've ever seen.  The only good part I can say about this game is the melee and gunplay mixture, and the controls are alright, but this game does not deliver in any other regard.  This game will take it's place beside many others as one of the worst games of 2015.

Devil's Third gets a 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Devil's third.. more like Devil's turd. horrible unpolished graphics and a low fps that only a terrible hackwork like this peace of **** game can bring. seems more like a salvage job than anything. now itagaki can just sit in his corner, trying to cover his teary eyes with long stupid hair, seeing all the horrible review scores pour in as his integrity goes down the drain. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The AI sucks. I thought it was a co-op game? Bugs everywhere and  story line. Don't waste your 29.99$ on Steam even though some of them praise the game a lot. Be honest, the AI really sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am changing my review from 6 to a 2! I only played a couple of levels and it didn't seem to bad, but now I have spent more time with it; I hate it with a passion! there is game breaking bugs, completely dumb A.I (I told kirk to go somewhere and he just ran against a wall until I reset checkpoint) boring hacking and rubbish story! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

AAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYY    JJJJJJJOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   is right, this game is not so terrible, it has decent graphics, good voice acting (nothing amazing, just no bad), but the controls, the glitches, the bugs, the co-op!!!, how can this be released to the public!?!?!?!?, it doesn't matter if a game may have the best story or graphics in the world if everything else is broken!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another crappy Star Trek game-- I can't believe I keep falling for this stuff! Since I can't get my money back, I'm advising everyone else to just hold onto theirs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Soo many bugs in this game, graphics are decent but who the hell cares.. the game really is buggy and has some enjoyable moments but buggy as hell. If you can actually get past the first 30 minutes of gameplay without running into a single bug, then you just won the lottery..

Star Trek Video game devs are going out of their way to not answering any of the user questions and making their game APPEAR as if it's a great game.

- Star Trek devs going to sites like Metacritic and giving their game a high score
- Lying on Steam forums that the Co-op works just fine, in the midst of people raging that it doesn't.
- Not releasing a reviewer copy of this game until after the game is released, obviously shows that the devs know their game is  and don't want anyone knowing that until they have already bought it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like most movie/TV franchise cash-ins, this is terrible. Go watch the actual Star Trek series instead of playing through this dreck. 2/10 bacon pancakes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The voice acting was the best thing about this game. Many of the other parts were buggy and underwhelming. As a movie game, I didn't expect a whole lot.  I don't recommend this game to anyone, even star trek fans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game fails to perform in every possible way it should. It fails at the very basics of making a good game, taking a great concept and rolling it around in dirt and throwing it into a box and charging $40.

77 from PC MASTER? What a joke, the first line in their "review" states its a bad game and still they give it a 7.7. LOL 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun for about an hour, then it all goes downhill. I thought I was going to be pleasantly surprised. The beginning of the game is well done. The pacing is alright, the graphics are decent and the environments are not boring. Then the rest of the game shows up. Let me put it like this: if you like shooting repetitive enemies in a boring, brown corridor, this is your game. Oh wait, no one likes that. It's like they had some neat ideas and then just gave up. Such a shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rule number 1:
Never ever per-order a game based on anything popular
Never purchase a game based on something popular without reviewing it.

It's getting a two as it's not loaded with errors, it just plain sucks.

Thankfully I tried it out for free and was very grateful for that opportunity 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A shining example of how NOT to make a video game. The voice acting may be good, but the gameplay is crap, and so are the graphics. While there is some high production value here and there, ultimately, textures are low res, gameplay is wonky (with a cover system that utterly fails), and story is unoriginal. Also, co-op did not work for nearly a week on PC. At least it didn't have always-on DRM (I'm looking at you Diablo III and SimCity). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this is one crappy game that I am extremely disappointed in. I had some reasonable hopes for this game that were completely destroyed by a total and utter lack of quality of any kind. The graphics are poor, adopting sort of a more cartoon/animated feel as opposed to the more realistic games that have lately come out. The story was pretty shoddy, with the typical "I'm an average joe, I don't know how to fight wars!" but somehow still manages kill hordes of incompetent nazis. The hit detection is amazingly frustratiing, with seemly invisible walls (no other way to really describe it) protecting the nazis that are seeking cover. A good example of this is when a nazi is crouch behind a boulder; despite crouching, I can still see a good two-thirds of his torso, but none of the shots hit when I try to shoot above the boulder to hit him. Look, I'm a pretty good shot in video games, so I'm pretty damn sure it wasn't user error. I ended up running over to him to blast him a point blank, but I did have to go around the boulder before doing so. The last nail in the coffin would be the terrible AI. I watched a nazi soldier shoot at me for a good 3-5 minutes, which isn't remarkable in itself, but what was remarkable was that during that entire time a fellow nazi was beating the crap out of him, meleeing him constantly while his "teammate" was attempting to shoot me. Eventually I put them out of their (and my) miseries. Don't buy this game. Rent if you REALLY want to suffer and you are a masochist. Or just download the demo. Stay away from this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Will someone please tell me how to get my money back on this disaster of a game? The promise of Turning Point: Fall of Liberty was high. The screenshots and early images were powerful and created a compelling reason to pick up a gun and fight. Even if you were tired of clipping Nazis on the battlefields of Europe, this twist of alternate history presented a setting from which to tell an immersive tale. However, the developer failed to translate the outrage of the early images into the final product and thereby left the player behind. The only outrage with Turning Point is that of the consumer. Compare this to the movie Red Dawn. The story opens with the lead characters 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, how do you screw up a game about shooting Nazis in New York? This is a horribly unplayable game - it's buggy beyond belief (did they even playtest it before shoving it out the door?), the AI is the worst I've seen in a next ten shooter (I found the best tactic is the "Looney Tunes" approach, just run around any random box and wait for them to chase you), the aiming is frustratingly unresponsive, and the game itself is a series of annoying "survival" missions against wave after wave of infantry blended with pointless "go here and do this" tasks with no real sense of accomplishment. All these awful aspects make this game nigh unplayable, which is incredibly sad because this game was supposed to make me soil my Alternative History shorts. EPIC FAIL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Turning Point Fall Of Liberty is a dreadful FPS that wastes an interesting premise.

Turning Point's first issue is the the horrible shooting mechanics.The guns have absolutely no punch to them.Another big issue here is the unforgivably retarded AI.They are horribly inaccurate and have absolutely no tactical organisation and the game follows all sorts of generic FPS cliches.

The graphics are terrible but the game's framerate remains stable throughout.The game has load times just like developer Spark Unlimited's other game Legendary that last about 2 minutes after you die.

The story here has potential,I won't spoil in case you want to play this piece of sh*t for some reason.

The sound design and soundtrack are awful too.

Overall,Turning Point Fall Of Liberty has to be one of the worst games for the 360.Avoid this at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't even play this game, it is awful. For starters, it's graphics are choppy and look awful, it's too easy, the A.I. is terrible, and a lot more issue that i can't discuss like collision problems. Another reason why you don't want to play this is because it is way too short; takes about 4-5 hours to beat. Hands down, this has got to be the worst of the Terminator games ever made, this folks is why developer GRIN shut down, because of awful games like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! thats the best advice that i can give. This game is terrible from start to finish. There are 3 types of enemies across all 9 levels, and its true, a very short game, i completed the game on hard in 3 1/2 hours. Good job i only paid £7 for it! Repetitive, boring, boring, boring, repetitive and boring! The slightly good point is the cover system and how you can flank the enemy, but thats it, no upgrades, no character development, nothing. Not really worth the easy Platinum trophy, as it was such a chore to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You pay 60 dollars for this in 2009. Then play 2-3 hours story alone or co-op, and that's it. No multiplayer, the story is just shooting and escaping from the city. Oh, and it have 4 diifferent difficulties WOW...No worth to buy this game now or never. Just DON'T! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game will be in my top 5 worst games I have payed. The campaign length is 4 hours, omg 4 fkn hours and thats it no multiplayer or co-op. The story and characters are just terrible. There are 3 types of enemies with awful AI. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Damn is this game good.... good at being a complete waste of time! Good at being an insult to every Terminator fan across the globe! Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE Terminator fan, I love the first 2 movies, I even enjoyed the third one but the fourth movie was admittedly pretty boring and overall a letdown so I didn't really have high expectations for it's video game counterpart. But I didn't imagine it could ever be this bad. First of all the game takes literally 3 hours to beat, on your first time, in the hardest difficulty. I found someone on YouTube complete it in 58 MINUTES!! Second, there is no variation in the enemies! You just fight the same four enemies over and over again, it's just SHOOT THE WASPS! SHOOT THE SPIDERS! SHOOT SOME WASPS! OH GOD, MORE SPIDERS! SHOOT THAT T-600! SHOOT THE SKIN-JOB! MORE WASPS AND SPIDERS! Also the whole game is linear, there is NO exploration and NO collectables whatsoever so you can't even lengthen the game by trying to get all of the collectables. Third, the AI is atrocious, your teammates are 100% useless and enemies just stand around waiting to be blown up! Fourth, the cursor for your weapon is too big! It's hard to shoot those annoying drifting wasps with a cursor that's bigger than them because there is NO accuracy! Fifth: the voice acting in this game couldn't be worse, the actors knew this game was rubbish and didn't even want to put effort into their performances. And finally the graphics are old, bland and just downright ugly! The character models are laughable and the animations look like they were designed by a 4 year old. The only redeeming factors is that this game does have the memorable Terminator theme tune (which is BAD ASS) and the atmosphere can sometimes feel like the Terminator universe but trust me, this is not very often and these factors don't make up for what a terrible game this is. Also there is NO ONLINE MULTIPLAYER! A mode of Terminators vs Resistance would be AWESOME! Why didn't they do it?! There is co-op for campaign which makes the game slightly more bearable but it only shortens the play time of the game even further! Overall this game should've been so much more. I'm still waiting for a GOOD Terminator game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks!! The minute machines get stuck in walls and my system freezes the game gets an automatic fail. Don't bother even renting this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tho it is VERY flashy, it is also extremely short. It takes approximately 4 hours to finish, and even hard mode is rather easy. There is only a few types of weapons (assault rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher, rocket launcher, and an upgraded assault rifle), as well as only 5 types of enemies for the entire game. Every chapter is the same. Walk from point A to B with nothing in between, fight a few enemies, then go to point C, more enemies, then mission complete. Also, the on-rails section are extremely poorly done, and very problematic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game makes you feel dirty as you try to push yourself past its boring, repetitive and overall terrible gameplay and "story"  and will only take you 4-5 hours to complete this game on the hardest difficulty, if you can get through it that is.

Another WW2 shooter. It's all been done, that's why there are so many futuristic shooters now. This has been done better so many times and has been done so much better. The game wasn't all bad, the graphics were nice and the story but we don't need another WW2 game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for the game but after getting my hands on a key I have to admit it was a big let down. I mean where do I even begin? The story is dull and the acting is terrible (mind you they recast the actors). As for the gameplay the first few maps are not fun to play and even though the weapons and abilities are cool, the RPG aspect is pretty much non existant. It becomes quickly repetitive and definitely not worth the pricetag. I also experienced a lot of bugs here and there, but I guess they will patch that soon, unless its like ROTT. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here's a tip for game developers. If you know you've made a game that's not very good--don't name it something that can be used against you in reviews. "Bombshell really bombs" doesn't make a very good review blurb. If you're going to go that route though, you might as well have titled this thing Crapburger. This game stinks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mindjack has potential.  However, the end product is a glitchy and bland experience.  While the main mechanic may make you think that this is a good buy, it is in fact not.  The paper-thin story and statue-like characters do not help the overall experience either.  The horrible game in its true form. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sur le principe, ça semblait alléchant et ça me faisait penser à un Messiah moins bidon. Hélas, c'est tout aussi bidon, voire bien pire. Le fameux principe de pouvoir pirater les ennemis n'est ici utilisé qu'à la vile fin de tirer un petit avantage dans des combats rapidement très confus et très ardus, tant les ennemis sont incroyablement résistants et nombreux.

En outre, pour un TPS avec système de couverture, on ne peut pas dire que les niveaux l'utilisent à bon escient : très (trop) peu d'endroits pour se couvrir ou mal disposés. Des scripts en veux-tu en voilà achèvent de pourrir l'expérience déjà mise à mal par une histoire tout simplement... inexistante. Un second point tout de même pour les graphismes très corrects, le tout tournant sans accroc sur la PS3. Sacrée daube en tout cas ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing through this game, I can't help but write all its negative aspects, as the positives are few and far between. The value of this game (I bought it for $20) is worth only 1 or 2 dollars. The modes offer very little diversity, and the graphics are obnoxious. Steer clear of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As once a massive fan of the first Ridge Racer, this game was just upsetting. Whole game is based around power-sliding at 200mph into a wall. All cars look the same, and all tracks are the same maybe just backwards. Quite upsetting for the price! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rented this for my son for the Wii, and I was not expecting much. But it was even worse than I expected. I should have just downloaded the free demo on our PS3 and just let him play that.

Confusing, repetitive and shallow. This game disapointed on every front. The interface is un-intuitive and does little to help the player navigate through the many options. The controls feel clunky and take some time to get used to. The AI is... quite simple and unimaginative. It took a couple hours to get the hang of the game and after that, only a couple more hours to figure out an infallible strategy. At that point, I had no interest in playing anymore. On the other hand, the concept of the game is incredible. The amount of work gone into it must have been staggering and the physics engine it's so proud of is quite fun at times. The different factions are varied enough to make it fun to switch although it might benefit to add some higher tiered units on all factions. Overall, the concept is wonderful but it fails to deliver and create a positive lasting experience. This game seemed to me more like a proof-of-concept that this could be a game someday. Not worth the money or the time the way it is now.

You have been permanently banned from all Cortex Command discussions.
You were banned by a Cortex Command developer.
Reason: "Trolling"

truth is this game is fun but has horrible game breaking bugs that the developer refuses to discuss or talk about. i bought this game just like everyone else but when i went to the discussion area to talk about how proper game ending code was missing, i was banned and refused the right to talk about the game i had bought. i am pretty sure there is freedom of speech bull i could bring up BUT THE TRUTH IS I JUST WANT THE GAME TO BE GREAT but sadly it inst. i give it a 2 for 4 hours of game fun but no prolong-able enjoyment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had potential, but it is still full of bugs and exploits.  There are quite a few things which can kill you and lose the game if you just slightly accidentally step the wrong way.  It also seems to be incredibly easy with the expoits.  The game recently updated which seemed to made it slightly more stable, so my score is going up, just a bit.  I also found a great mod for it, so that helped too.  Games that support modding tend to go up on my list.  I still wouldn't say this game is -that- worth it, so it all depends on how faithful you are.  I might have rated it higher, if the dev didn't have fan boys coming here to rig the user score by posting fake 9-10 ratings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is brutally boring, and in Co-Op mode I couldn't see what my character was doing most of the time.  The fixed camera zooms out so much I'm straining to see what my little character is doing or where he is.  Also, all you push is X over and over and the occasional Y button.  This game is one of the worst games I have played in a long long time.  What a disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game at my friends house when I was in my "Willing to try anything" phase. My first thought was "Eh. It can't be too bad if it's got giant monsters right?". Unfortunately my loose expectations were left in confusion as I played this dull, mindless, and terribly basic RPG if you can even address it by such a dignified title. No wonder it was on the discount isle. I found myself totally oblivious to the fact that it was game. It felt more like a homework assignment that was due in the next four hours, since that's all it took to beat the freakin' thing. It wasn't challenging, it wasn't interesting, it was ugly, it was stupid (As opposed to smart), it was like staring at a television turned off only I'm pretty sure I'd be more entertained watching a blank screen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst GBA Game  I have ever played. A Horrible port from the Xbox Version don't waste your time on this piece of crap. Bad Graphics and sound effects 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has it's place: 10 years ago. It's terrible, acting like a poor Wolfenstein or Goldeneye in graphics, with even worse mechanics and animation. Right off the bat, I noticed that enemies all seemed to be missing about 1/3 of their animation frames, making them appear as if they are "lagging" across screen. It's this choppy enemy movement, coupled with the poor aiming controls and lack of (intuitive) shot physics that make even the possibly entertaining shooting (as nothing else in this game is too well done or entertaining) not fun. So, with it's downfall in action, the game also boasts an incredibly linear level structure, with a bland, boring, and very Win95 "Maze" screensaver feel to the surroundings. I do not recommend this game to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Considering this is supposed to be an elite unit, the gameplay isn't even close to being realistic. I thought GR2 was bad, but this is the worst GR yet. Even if it is, like awesome duuuuuuuuude, on the X-box 360 the Ghost teams don't act like any SF unit out there, maybe a glorified Ranger unit at best. I love how product placement by Crye and Hatch as well as the HK XM-8 (which is now a failed project and scrapped) are littered throughout the game. At least they got the Mutlicam right - everyone knows they will be replacing the useless ACUs soon anyway. Overall, it's just boring urban shooting and nothing more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't care what anyone says, Tetris always has been and always will be the greatest puzzle game ever created. With that in mind you have to wonder how anyone can make such as mess of it!

For some reason the creators of Tetris Worlds have seen fit to include a 'story mode', that strangely tries to explain the origins of the falling blocks, and then added all manner of pointless variations on top of  the original gameplay. To make matters worse even the original mode is ruined by the fact that the blocks move far to slowly and the controls are not responsive enough.

Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Campaign game is just as laggy as real "LIVE". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If I had to describe this game in one word it would be "frustrating." The beasts can't be controlled well, the game LOVES to send incoherent respawn creatures to surround you in an enclosed area, the "necessary" defense stuff really is atrocious, and you get money that you never can use. Truly a waste of $$$ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gameplay variety and arcade modes can't overcome frustration with weak controls and annoying trial and error gameplay. This is the only game I've ever traded in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to agree with Mattaclysm on this one, as much as I love NIS this is a disgraceful game that shames the industry we know and love. For a start I beat the game in 7 hours, and there is NO bonus content, I admit I used a guide (lazy sod I am) but most people seem to complete it within 15 hours, needless to say its very short. Its also brutally difficult at times with mammoth difficulty spike every time you move to a new area (until the last few dungeons where this game is a cake walk) and the combat is flawed to the point to controller breaking frustration. You have 2 characters in  battle (both so unintersting I don't know there names) but in one gets paralized, they both do, if one gets poisoned... they both do etc which is particularly brutal during fights against 7 trolls and its taken you 15 minutes to get to the last one and you're both paralized. That said the battle system has some redemtion, I quite like choosing limbs to hack at in order, orcourse picking the order which to attack 9 seperate limbs for 7 enemies in one battle takes the bulk of you're time during battle, I seriously spent most my time sticking numbers beside limbs of all things. The graphics are, well, there just awfull, the textures are fairly decent res but they are so bland and lifeless, characters models suck, and the artwork is even worse. In LRs defense I must say  some enemy models are quite well drawn to be fair, a few of the smaller ones in particular are done in a cell-shaded style that actually looks rather good. The music is flat-out the very worst music I have heard in my life, 'cept for one battle theme, its hideous and always sounds like you're under a motorway... yes Hitmaker and NIS call that "music" and the voice acting is bad, the story even worse. I should also note that the map is useless on a SD TV, you NEED HD for this game to read the words on the map, the enviroments are really difficult to navigate as they are. One redeeming feature (to some of us) is this game has the easiest Platinum trophy ever, even more so than Megamind (I'm ashamed to say I have both) and thankfully this game has no DLC, so you can't get ripped off twice. I'm actually amazed at how possitively this game has been recieved, it is far worse than Sonic 06 and Hyper D, not equall, NIS should be ashamed to still have this tripe on there online store let alone there name on the box. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very bland, repetitive, boring, annoying, lacks a lot, mediocre gameplay, and lots more wrong with it but there is only a few good things about this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Superman is tedeous game  The repeat tics missions will bore you out  The game was developed poorly and it looked like developers didn't try  This game isn't for everyone  The controls are confusing and annoying 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They should have just called this one teenage mutant ninja "turd" les...what a letdown! $50 for avg graphics and repetitive uninspired gameplay. Don't waste your time. I rented this and still feel burned by it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watchmen: The end is nigh part 2 does get some parts right. Local splitscreen co-op is something you sadly don't see very often today and i was thrilled when the game recognized my third party controller without any fuss. The visuals are alright and it is fun to play as the characters from the comic/movie. The rest of the game though is quite disappointing to say the least. The combat system feels stiff and unsatisfying and it gets repetitive really quick. Prepare yourself to fight the same guys with the same boring moves over and over again for that is what you are going to be doing the biggest part of the game. Add that the AI is pretty much broken and you get a pretty worthless fighting-game. From time to time i found the AI standing beside me waving their arms and refusing to attack me. I could literary walk away from the computer and still be at full health when i returned. No stay away from this game no matter the price. I can only recommend it do die hard Watchmen fans and people dying for a cheap splitscreen co-op game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The controls of this game are infuriating. I guess it's a successful port but the fact that it takes so much tapping to do anything really sucks the fun away.

Be prepared, this is one of the games that will destroy your bottom screen if played a lot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only reason to buy the game in this state is to take part in a paid beta, but if you want to buy a game to enjoy and play with few problems than don't buy this game.  It has many issues and is very unstable, not to mention that it has incomplete features.  The current release is pretty much unacceptable for a "released" game.The fault for this lies with the developer, not the publisher.  The developer is the one who comes up with the ideas and has to realise them and they have to do it within an agreed upon period, so given the game is so broken and incomplete the blame has to be squarely on the Kerberos.  It's clear they aimed far too high for either their skill or manpower (or a combo) to meet within the development period.  However, most disappointing was that they kept fans in the dark about the state of the game, which is made worse by the fact several of those who worked on the game were highly active with the community.  You can also put some blame on the publisher for not saying anything either and while it is easy to say they should have given Kerberos more time, they can only be expected to sink so much money without a return into a project.  All in all the release by both parties should have been better handled.The game is been patched with the aim of making it work, but it will take some time.  Best plan would be to wait 6 - 12 months and have another look at the game unless as I said, you wanted to take part in a beta test.  So far for me this game has not been worth its price.  You can see the potential in the game, but I didn't buy the game to look at it and imagine the cool things it could do so I can't give it anything outside of the red zone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With the new patches and extension, the game is working much more stable. But it still feels very unfinished. there are still bugs that should be there, many things are totally unexplained and you need to read them up in forums or somewhere in the internet. It feels strange to play it. I still get headache because I just dont understand most of the game. I mostly fight agains the game and User interface itself then agains the Other races or players in the game. I'm a great fan of sots 1 from the first day, and I would highly recommend Sots 1 for anyone who like these games. But in my opinion, sots 2 is just a shadow of sots 1 with better graphic. This game is good for hardcore fans or people who just want to support Kerberos. But its not a game for people who just heard about Sword of the Stars or want a finished game to enjoy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're considering to buy this game, please note that if you DO NOT know the game system/have not played SOTS original, this game is NOT for you. Is other commenters have said, this game is not totaly finish, and there are alot of problems with the gameplay. If you really want to play SOTS II due to the awesome grafhics, please note (again) you will ONLY buy it for the grafhics then. It is not an enjoyable experience (yet)!  Though it you're smart, and like the 'make your own space battle ships and take over the intire universe' gameplay, play the first one. Its much more stable and alot easier for newcommers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As for July 2012 this game is still bad. Yes, the most (all?) bugs have been fixed, game does not crash and looks good. But that is not enough to make it a good game. The UI is still horrble, its very hard to find out what is really going on in your empire, what possible threats are incomming (be that some space menaces attacking your planet or simple over-spending of your budget). On strategic level, game is very complicated, but that does not transfer to wide variety of strategic options, on the contrary, you get drawn into finding out some small details (like why the hell can't I send my ships to system X). Space combat is quite boring, plays by itself and if you have bigger fleet, you win, if smaller, you loose and nothing you can click can change it (well, maybe you can retreat if you are lucky to find out how, i wasnt). Research system is ok, although I personally do not like the randomized tree and time-wasting feasibility studies, but thats personal preference. To summarize: the devs fixed the crash bugs during last 8 months. Now they should spend at least the same time to make this game fun - but I'm not sure they are willing to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It Is Just A Copy of The PS4 Verdun, If You Ask Me, I Would Not Play This Game. It Is Just A Ripoff In My Personal Opinion And That Is All I Know, This Game Is Just, A Disappointment 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is full of bugs. Game slike that should benn released. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All I can say is that this game is bad. The shooting and recoil is bad. The enemies are generic. The guns are generic. If this game was free I would not waste my time on it. stay away! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had heard about this game and was like "oh its an FPS where you travel in time. That could be totally rad!" Its honestly unbelievable how many things are wrong with this game. People, this game costs $60. The developer and publisher are saying to you "This is worth as much as any other game", which means yes, this game is directly competing with AAA titles like COD and Halo and whatnot. I would have rated it higher if it were appropriately priced, because this is a budgetware title that will be in the $5 bin within a month. I've had all like 4 friends play this game. After the initial 20 minutes (which are filled with laughs because of how crappy everything is), my friends invariably say "God get it away from me! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(This review is for the 360- as I could not access the 360 user review section under this game) Where can I possibly start? Warriorsa legend of Trow is the most repetitive, boring and tedious hack and slasher I've ever played. Instead of boring you with the details, I found the story to be completely pointless. There is no context between the characters you play as, the voice acting is just awful, and the most fun I had was when I turned the game off and thinking of splatterhouse (which I didn't like much either!) Granted the game has some positives, it works and the enemy numbers on screen are ok for my standards. Technically Legends of Troy has unresponsive and utterly dull AI and there are all kinds of technical mishaps and glitches to unearth. Hell perhaps one of the worst parts of the game are the parts where you power up. Instead of being a good thing as you slash away at foes DW style, you are vulnerable to losing health, detracting from the power you're supposed to have. When you do power up, there just isn't the sense that the blood fits in. Sure it adds to the carnage, but it's just showing off when you consider it's basically ripping off Splatterhouse and plastering DW vaneer on it. Just don't buy legends of troy, otherwise you'll experience the most derivative action game,which runs parallel with movie cash ins. I can't help but reccomend Splatterhouse or even DW, just play a hack and slasher with some depth and leave this diseased corpse where it lies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Play the Wii version, it's much, much, MUCH better than this pile of crap. It's like this one is an entirely different game! And they don't allow you to play the proper version unless you buy a first print crappy version!
The game itself (Wii version) is a fun yet challenging Nights-style game with an excellent use of Wii remote. Highly recommend to at least try (Wii version, yes I will repeat it as long as I need) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me put it this way.

I bought this game for $10 at a used book store. It wasn't even worth $5. Maybe $1 (the price of a candy bar). Or, better, yet, for free, because this game resembles free Internet games I have played that do it better.

This game's list price was actually $20. That is a robbery.

If you want a 2D space arcade shooter, you can play this game: http://www.arcadetown.com/realspace2/index.asp

Twice as fun, twice as long, twice as difficult, and honestly I think this game may have been based on it. Any way you slice it, just about anything is a better value than the 1 hour of your freetime it will take to complete this game.

The only reason I am giving this game a 3 is because I know there are some people out there who will enjoy the game just because it is Battlestar Galactica. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Avoid this game at all costs... I beat it, and I'm not proud of it. The Sonic series and it's fans deserves better than a platformer with slipshod control and an even worse shooter. Shadow was cooler in SA2, enough said. May Sega stop making pointless spinoffs and get Sonic The Hedgehog back on track. If not, well there's always Super Smash Bros Brawl. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As an overhead shooter Dead Horde is about as bad as they come. It's missing a very key element--FUN. Linear levels, a basic weapon cache, and bad graphics are some of other poor qualities that make up this game. Even the coop element doesn't make this game attractive. Skip this one. There's are countless other overhead shooters where your money would be better spent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games I've played.  And I've been playing games for 19 years plus.  Ok maybe that's an exaggeration, but at the very least it's one of the worst I've played in recent memory.  I rented it on a whim with low expectations, figuring at the very least it could occupy me for a few hours a day over the weekend.  I was mistaken. I gave up after about 10-15 minutes.  The graphics were outdated, the mechanics were stale, the weapons uninspiring, and on top of that it was consistently buggy and was lagging every 3-4 minutes.Unless you're a huge huge fan of the game and have the patience of Job, don't rent it.  And unless you have $60 that you don't mind lighting on fire, don't buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Games like this shame us all. Thousands of years from now a race of alien beings will sift through artifacts found in the  irradiated ruins of Northern America, find this game, and then proceed to thermonuclear bomb the living crap out of our planet.  Call of Juarez: The Cartel isn't just an unfinished mess of a game that wasn't that brilliant to begin with, it's a scam. While it's really hard to pinpoint the "worst"thing about this game, I'm going to have to say that it's the driving system. Instead of  giving you the option of changing the driving perspective, they force you into first person from the perspective of sitting in the drivers seat. You use R2 to drive, the Left stick to steer the car, and the RIght stick to look around the cab. Since you can't see through the entire windshield from where you sit, you have to constantly look around the cab interior while trying to drive, and so driving becomes a frustrating mess. And then for no reason what-so-ever, they've made it so it's impossible to see behind you when you're driving. Finally when you are in a car, the health of the car is the same as your own health, so if the car get's shot up and breaks, you die for no damn reason all. Finally add to all that the fact that you can't exit the car at any point during a mission, so if your car starts taking heavy damage, you have no where to run.This all screams of developer laziness. Rather than develop a special set of rules governing how a player controls a car, Techland just used the same control setup for driving that it used for walking. And that's just one example of the hundreds of bad decisions that went into the creation of this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Qu'est-ce qu'on peut retenir de ce truc ? quelle est l'image qui vient à l'esprit ? le flou ! les graphismes sont flous (avec d'affreux déchirements de l'image en prime, la faute à l'absence de synchro), c'est plein de brouillard et quand c'est pas du brouillard, c'est de la brume. Et en plus ça rame.

La jouabilité est floue elle aussi, sans aucune sensation, malgré la présence d'un ralenti à la Max Payne mais qui s'avère assez minable il faut bien le dire. Même la partie sonore apparaît bâclée, tout comme la musique, sortie d'un ascenseur. Les voix de la VF sont par contre excellentes : ça me désole qu'on ait mis une si belle VF au service d'un jeu aussi mauvais. Totale perte de temps. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

a lot of glitching in this game the Sega did a really terrible job making the great effects for this game , the aliens need to improve especially when they die  it's not gore the characters are not using their brains really Brad Thompson !!!!!!!!!!!! do you take us gamers seriously call of duty ghost did not take us seriously now your a bad writer  you have no taste or you never understand for classic movies like Ridley Scott's alien and James Cameron's Aliens. Grade C- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The biggest gaming let-down of this century.  Fans waited seven years.. for this?  I have lost faith in Gearbox as a company with the way they handled this release.  There is no excuse for the patchwork story, buggy menus, and lack of dedicated multiplayer servers.  Everything in this game feels low rent, as if it was an after-thought and that the game needed to be pushed out from development hell.  Avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the biggest gaming failures. Its story is a joke, the coop is a joke, the mp modes are the usual uninspired tdm call of duty garbage. Overall this game is a joke. Don't buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Biggest let down of this decade, Alien Colonial Marines was promised to be a gritty shooter with survival horror elements but all it amounts to is another Call of Duty clone with awful AI. The Alien AI awful and is completely different to the game play shown before launch, with aliens spazing across the walls and charging toward the player and missing by miles. The story is lack luster and was not used to the best effect. The gun play is fun but you end up fighting generic Waylon Yuntani merc's with no character. In the end the game amounts to lack luster game play, plot and AI. Warning do not pick this game up! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1) Atrocious AI; especially the aliens. They just make a beeline for you.
2) Dated graphics; unlike what was seen in the demos.
3) First level was great with a great atmosphere and build up. It stops there, at the first level.
4) "EPIC" boss battle.
5) This is related to the second point; there's absolutely no sense of dread or "feel". Flip switch, run and gun, flip switch, run and gun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's sad but  I think the sounds were the only thing i enjoyed about the whole game. The Aliens were difficult to track if you lost them especially the face huggers. 80's iconic symbols always seem to get ruined when created now, so sad so much more potential tech wise and I feel like I wasted $67 dollars 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Campaign: Not worth to mention: Broken AI. Story is illogical garbge. It's running in circles and shoot aliens. Let's move to the Multiplayer:

Matchmaking:
No dedicated Servers. "Host leaved the game" every few minutes. Not much more to say

Feeling: (Alien)
Switching to the third person view may be a good descision for making gameplay more smooth, but the lack of proper animations and the fact that the alien moves like your put a stick up his  and now pulling some strings absolutly ruins it. Feeling: (Marine)
It's ok. I'm missing some kind of distant radio. I had a guy with his micro not muted and i could hear the dampened gunfire while catching up with the group. It was actually pretty cool. Otherwise the game lacks a proper envoirement sound set. If you spawn after death somewhere you can't hear nothing. It's so peaceful, you may settle down and have a picnic with a nearby spitter. Also the guns feel somehow cheap, like made out of lego bricks. To be honest all the models feel like i bought a 14,99 Indie game.

Maps:
The maps i played so far are uther rubbish. Sorry envoirement artist and level designers, but did you play your maps once? There's no tatic. It's just "find the best spot to sit on" and stay there and shooting the aliens coming from two directions. Forget vents, they're placed almost randomly without strategic purpose.

Season Pass:
You expect me to pay 30 bucks for you to maybe fix this, really?

There are some things cool about this game but it doesnt compensate the games overall cheap feeling and bad, bad, bad, BAD map design. Just my personal opinion on this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crap game. Bought the hype that Gearbox would actually make a good game out of a much beloved franchise. AI is  you can actually run through the whole game without fighting or taking on an alien. Check on youtube for the video for proof. This is a joke game. Not worth $60.00..save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its bad... Its really, really bad. What was suppose to be a good game turned out to be horrible and it almost made me want to cry being a big fan of the Alien series. I had no fun while playing. You get way to many guns and enemies are so easy to kill. Its to easy and then you end up not having fun at all. The best part about it is the online mode where you get to control an Alien. And controlling an Alien sucks so much. At least this game functions? It sucks.

Aliens: Colonial Marines gets a 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a massive letdown. All the time it spent in development hell turned it into a buggy, boring mess of a game. it could have been so much more. What we ended up getting is a below average run-of-the-mill FPS. I shan't go into more detail, since others have covered it over and over again. Simply avoid it, even if you are an Aliens fan.

Jimbo Rating: 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The absolute worst game of 2013 so far. The single player is 5 HOURS, FIVE MO******CKING HOURS AND IT IS BORING, REPETITIVE AND PREDICTABLE. The characters are forgettable. The story is forgettable. The AI is  they stop and wait for you and forgets that there is Xenomorphs around. And my biggest complain is that you fight Weyland-Yutani soldiers INSTEAD OF XENOMORPHS WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY DO THAT!? THIS IS AN ALIENS GAME! Ok so the story is you are a guy named Winter and you are on a spaceship when it gets attacked by xenomorphs then you find out that guess who is behind it? That is right Weyland-Yutani then the spaceship crashes on the planet then find Hadley's Hope after that the story is BULL****! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is crap.
- Kicking in steel doors, diving through the  of a marine dropship that an Alien Queen cant even get through
- Aliens that either rush right at you or stand motionless
- Aliens that rush up to you, strike once, then idle
- Weyland Yutani mercenaries by the boatload. Seriously, forget the Aliens. This game is about killing people.
- Acid Blood doesn't hurt
- Unless it's specifically chosen as a weapon, in which case it mystically hurts
- Remember the first sign Alien 4: Resurrection would suck? The alien in a glass cage that lets you see every orifice? This game does it too! WITH EVERY VARIANT, including the ones not yet seen.
- Xeno variants that couldn't have possibly been bred. What? Why are they spitting acid? How did a facehugger impregnate a rhinoceros?!
- Graphics suck, unlike the graphics they sold preorders on.
- Duke Nukem Forever made an Aliens game worse. I mean are you for ****ing real?
- Fire extinguishers react to your fire. By disappearing.
- a chestburster farm in a lab... with 0 containment for the chestbursters.  What do you do with xeno infested humans? Mercy kill. Nope, not these ones. They're made of iron.
- Every single ongoing Weyland experiment fails catastrophically as soon as you look at it.
- Oh a captive queen. How quaint. Oh look, she suddenly figured out how to break free. She's smashing the glass to get at me! Uh oh, she broke through the glass!  Phew, she gave up.
- Aliens for the most part cannot transition surfaces while climbing. No clue why. If you want to get onto the ceiling, you need an app for that. Oh sorry, I meant a 'perk'.
- controls randomly invert when climbing as an alien. Yes, ALL of them. Because wall movement wasn't hard enough.
- Xeno pounces have a wonderful 5% chance of failing, leaving your lurker pinning down a marine until either the match ends or another player comes along and either kills you or steals your kill.
- Claymore mines can be dropped instantly, and while in the midst of another animation. Lurker just pinned you and about to chew off your face? No problem. RETROACTIVE CLAYMORE!
- You can also sit on your claymores, because strangely they just don't hurt humies.
- Challenge order. Bizarre. Three challenge types, one of each on offer at any given time. Usually the hardest ones straight at the beginning.
- There's a mission where PMC's and Weyland techs run from your team despite superior numbers. They escape through doors in the side of the ship. Looking out a window  you notice they are doors directly to space.
- Super weapon backpack. You have access to something like 16 weapons and 4 tacticals and thousands of rounds plus secondary rounds on you at all times. D&D did it first!
- There are 9 multiplayer maps split between 4 game modes. On many of the maps, you could smell an opponents fart on the opposite end.
- Mapping orbs! "Look, we can Prometheus, too!" exclaims Randy Prichford with a piggish squeal. "ugh" exclaims you, whose quite sick of the half-assed 'nods' without any obvious love for the material.
- PRE RENDERED cut scenes! WOW! Why did developers stop doing this? I mean, the gamer was never immersed in the first place so you don't have to worry about that jarring transition, the 12 frames per second of the video is TOTALLY unnoticeable if you pack in enough ACTION!!!, and frankly, We miss running a server-farm for weeks to render this junk.

Ok. I'm out of obvious things. You guys take it from here. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  It's the worst game in terms of gameplay that I've played in the last several years.  If you're going to buy this game, wait a few months for it to plummet in price.  I'm sure Valve will be selling it for pennies on the dollar soon enough.  I've waited for this game for years, preordered based on the demos, and was really looking forward to it.  What was released was a subpar shooter, with below average graphics and terrible netcode.  The horror aspect?  It really struck me as I realized my friends and I had spend $150 on this game.

I am so irritated about the 3 hours of gameplay in this game and the awful multiplayer that I'm not going to be buying either Gearbox or Sony for a while. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not wanting to discuss plot for spoiler reasons, I'll stick to mentioning awful AI, poor level design, baffling plot choices (single player), horrific balance (multiplayer, spitters ftw) and some of the worst scripting and voice acting I've heard, ever.
The game isn't worth your time, Gearbox should be ashamed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After years of anticipated waiting I was totally let down and should have burned my 50 dollars that would have provided me more enjoyment and entertainment for my dollar.
This game is chock full of bugs, clipping issues, and stuck enemies. Voice cues will trigger after you’ve already cleared a room. It’s so bad that I was instructed to “cover the right flank” when there was nothing but a wall to my right. In larger arena-style areas, it isn’t uncommon to wonder why nothing else is happening, only to find a bad guy inanimately stuck next to a box just waiting to be killed.
At least your sonar-style motion tracker will be useful in finding those stuck guys because it’s pointless otherwise. You’ll use it before opening a door, not see anything of concern, then enter and get attacked anyway. But it doesn’t really matter because the xenomorphs are fragile idiots. Their AI is on par with the standard Infected from Left 4 Dead, but now they get to climb on walls. Xenomorphs conveniently ignore any squadmates nearby and come right at you. Sometimes they’ll crawl on the ground, but most of the time I was shooting at awkward geriatric people that should be in nursing homes with walkers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not fundamentally broken (with the possible exception of the AI) but it doesn't feel like it's a finished product either.  It doesn't capture the feel of the Aliens movie, it looks dated and it's short and not very interesting.  In no way does it live up to the marketing and hype around it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Coming from an Alien/Predator fan, this game is a complete disappointment. I waited 5 years for a game that makes DNF look like a masterpiece. I had to REALLY force myself to finish the campaign. What makes this game so bad, you ask?

1- The AI. That damn AI...the worst I have EVER seen. Enemies can't do anything but run straight at you, your comrades will shoot walls in an (obviously futile) attempt to hit an enemy: they can't "see" the obstacle! Of course they will shoot through you as well. Sometimes enemies stand still in the middle of a room. Even at the highest difficulty the bad guys are just too stupid and that results in the game being extremely easy.
2- The plot makes no sense, the character's reactions are completely off and you're left wondering whether the authors behind this were 5 years old fans. It's that stupid. Oh, the ending makes you want to punch in the face whoever wrote this garbage.
3- No atmosphere. I remember the old AVP1/AVP2. Those games were terrifying when playing the Marine campaign. In Colonial Marines you feel nothing...well sometimes you get angry over how stupid everything is. It's that boring.

These are just the three main issues with the game, but there's a lot more, for example the bad animations and the mediocre (at best) graphics but that's not really something I look at when judging a videogame. There are a few good things, though, like the guns (they sound really nice), one of the levels (although it doesn't last long) and the MP, which isn't horrible.

Overall, this game is extremely bad, and may very well be the worst game I have ever played. If you're thinking "I'll try it anyway because I'm a fan of the Alien Saga" then listen to me and DON'T do it. You'll be even more disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was this one big joke to Gearbox? It certainly comes across that way to me and to think that I have followed this game for more than 6 years; this release feels like a massive kick in the teeth...

Well, I guess we all saw those Randy Pitchford videos where he was creaming in his pants talking rubbish about how he is a massive fan of the Aliens movie that James Cameron directed. Well Pitchford, you should be ashamed of yourself as this game is awful! If you loved the franchise that much, why is this game so S**T? Why did you not endeavour to make this the best Alien game available? All these questions will never get answered and really, we all should have known better because he talked up Duke Nukem Forever as if that was going to be some kind of genre defining game which also turned out to be S**T!

Anyways, what we have here is a first person shooter set after the events of Aliens. The game follows a team sent to find out what has happened to the Sulaco and of course, what happened on the planet LV-426 (although that is not the same location the game goes too, it's LV-244). The game looks like Aliens if you ignore the poor graphics, awful animations and clippings, and the vast amount of bugs. It's funny but the E3 demo that Pitchford again was showing off with such Glee looks nothing like the product I have purchased??? False advertising most definitely as the released version looks 6 years out of date whereas the E3 demo was full of lovely shadows and lighting and had a much crisper visual and colour palette set (looked like advanced current gen).

Gameplay wise, the story is a complete mess. It's hopelessly derived   and should have been handled with much more care... where's the love Pitchford??? The guns sound great but feel underpowered. Locations feel samey with textures that are low resolution and adding to this is the minimal physics used on objects within these rubbish environments, the actual feeling of interaction is ZERO. It's just not that great to look at and my god it’s even worse to play.

Enemy A.I consists of over erratic cover seeking morons that pop up and downs three times whilst shooting, then move to a different location, repeat the same process; and then move back to the previous location until you put their idiotic path finding body fodder down. Aliens sometimes move authentically but this immersion is broken once they glitch into a wall or turn 90 or 180 degrees in one motion... Its school boy error stuff and the question of this game getting through quality control is a bitter pill to swallow.

It is hard to pick out redeeming moments from this game to be honest. It is not worth the time or money and unless you are a person that isn’t overly critical when it comes to games, you will have a tough time playing through to the end. With A.I that has the simplest of path finding code, aliens that act like drunks rather than predators seeking out their prey and a story line that is so redundant, you don’t really care; it’s hard to actually want to keep playing this game. The hardest part of the whole process of playing then reviewing a game based on my favourite movie of all time was the fact that I didn’t really have high expectations for it. I didn’t want a 10/10 game… I just wanted to feel like a bad ass playing in the boots of a Marine. Feel the feedback of the Pulse rifle when I offloaded a clip into a dangerous xenomorph. I wanted to seal doors with my hand held welder (you do this but it’s irrelevant and has no impact on the games mechanics) and lock down an area as if it’s a ‘last stand moment’… Using the motion tracker is pointless and is not even needed in game, yet they have included it… WHY? SO IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALIENS GAME!!! Pitchford you’re a fool and so is your team! This franchise has so much quality material you couldn’t go wrong yet you have churned out this disaster! If the game was not very good, why lead everyone down the garden path with the hype videos and e3 demo showing the quality that would never feature in the final product shipped? They should have just cancelled it or gone back to the drawing board…

This game is not recommended  2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can't believe the quality of this game. I played it for a few hours and I couldn't believe the bugs (no pun intended) littered everywhere. After realising how bad it is I found out that the Alpha gameplay demo is in fact a far superior version to the actual game. It actually looks like a different game. I have been scammed out of my money along with many many other supporters of this game. I loved Borderlands 1  2 and I had absolute faith that Gearbox could deliver. But this just isn't the case. If there is a game to avoid this year, then Aliens: Colonial Marines is the top contender.  I wouldn't even get this out of the bargain bin, and if you are a big ALIENS fan. Then I would stay a nuclear bomb radius away from this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am very disappointed. The demo looked so good with all the effects and graphics and the final game looks like a bad joke. The KI is horrible, the game is very linear and  the Aliens are not scary they are just canon fodder. The game has 11 level. From this 11 level there are 3 or 4 level which repeat, so you play them and later you have to play them again, just in another mission. Last there is the horrible end. This game is a huge disappointment and you shouldn't even think to buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this a 2 because I actually got enjoyment out of it. But as far as games go I feel like I wasted my 50$. This game will likely be 5$ on a steam sale in a year for sure. I got sucked in as a die hard aliens fan. Before this game even got released I had a feeling it was going to be bad. Not because of something we were shown, but because of what we WEREN'T shown. A day before release and I'm sitting there paying for the preorder through steam, thinking to myself "isn't it odd that there isn't a single actual gameplay video for this game? No teaser no nothing that is relevant to the release candidate?". Well I learned my lesson we can say that. I am not going to sum up everything I thought was wrong about this game, but I think I was one of the few that actually didn't mind the graphics. The worst part was the gameplay itself. It's an aliens game that is actually more difficult during the parts where you fight humans. Which happens roughly 50-60% of the game, or at least feels like it because it's harder. There are WAY too WY soldiers to fight in this game. The aliens in this game are laughably bad at what they do, so much so that it's not even scary to fight the aliens, not even difficult to say the least. They either run straight at you, or are a "spitter"  alien (dreamt up by someone who theorized it would make a good game element in multiplayer probably) with a glowing head that you can see from a mile away. The multiplayer while it is somewhat fun, is basically just a back and forth with aliens and marines in a small call of duty arena style battle. Good luck getting into any other game modes beyond team deathmatch because everyone has already moved on from the game. If this game ended up going the multiplayer route of natural selection 2, this game could have actually been  awesome. Even if all the other gaping flaws still existed, the natural selection 2 multiplayer model with an aliens theme would have been so so sick.

The worst part about this game is without a doubt the alien melee "pistol" finishers. I have never seen such a  waste of animation in my entire goddamn life. Let me put it this way. In an aliens game, if you put your entire hand and pistol in an aliens mouth (and alien with molecular acid blood) and pull the trigger, you better be either pulling a half melted pistol out of it's mouth or be screaming while the bones fall off your hand for me to even START believing the character just did that. But no, your character will  jam his pistol and hand into the aliens mouth, pull the trigger, and pull it out completely unscathed. I'm SHOCKED I haven't seen more complains about this, because this is the stupidest thing I have ever seen. The lack of realistic consequences in this game absolutely kills any potential of fear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game before the massive 'upgrade' patch if you want to call it that.  The graphics were okay, but the AI was very dumb.  Aliens would hit you once then run away around a corner and stare at a wall it was that bad.    However.......changing the AI so that every single alien on the screen runs straight at you AND only you regardless of how many other marines are standing around is even dumber.  Plus those said marines still have dumb AI that don't actually help you at all.  Then you get up to the first human rivals and they have an uncanny ability to throw grenades directly at you and frequently, all the while ignoring the rest of your marine teams which still stand around scratching their balls.    The game is a poor failure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what is this aliens:colonial marines or human:colonial marines.i loved the first level and i thought why people hate this game so much,now i understand.aliens colonial mariens is a terrible game in the first level the graphics are good after the first level has became one of the worst game i have ever played the desing is horrible the fact that this game called aliens:colonial mariens and you are fighting humans more than half of the game or that the game ending is just horrible and easy or that the game is 7 hours on ultimate bad ass the only thing that lets me give this game a 2/10 instead a zero is the multiplayer its quite fun but its doesnt help this game to be good.aliens colonial marines=one of the top 10 worst game on angry joe list and also my list 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was one of the fools who pre-ordered this. When I saw the reviews on its release day, I wasn’t expecting a great game but it was worse than I imagined. Graphics from 5 years ago and gameplay from 10 years. It’s not scary, it lacks atmosphere, the weapons feel weak, the AI is atrocious, the NPCs constantly glitch and the animations of the aliens are so laughably bad at times it breaks any possible immersion into the game’s world. And why am I spending more of the game shooting men than HR Geiger’s monsters? I didn’t buy a game set in the Aliens universe to shoot at other marines. The multiplayer isn’t much better. I was hoping that it would be like a cross between Valve’s Alien Swarm and Tripwire’s Killing Floor, both tactical co-op shooters that employ strategy, different player classes, a varied range of weapons and equipment, and which require planning and strong co-operation and co-ordination between players (at least on the harder difficult settings). Instead it’s a poor imitation of the versus mode from the far superior Left 4 Dead. The maps are badly designed, the game mechanics are poor, the controls are clumsy, and there are no player classes and a very limited range of weapons. If you want to play a co-operative game set in an Aliens-like universe then I strongly recommend Alien Swarm, which is a 100% free game available on Steam.

The game feels unfinished and from what I’ve read about its disastrous six-year development it sounds like it was a rush job done in nine months in order to get rid of the project and appease publisher Sega. It’s hard to believe this is the same developer (ie Gearbox) that brought us the excellent Borderland games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The marriage of a first-person shooter and the Alien franchise should be a perfect fit, especially from Gearbox, a team rooted in the genre. And yet, the pairing eludes a happy ending once again. Aliens: Colonial Marines isn't disappointing because it couldn't live up to lofty expectations, it's disappointing because it turned out to be such an unfettered disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Waste of money. DO NOT BUY. Has the story of a fan-fiction, repetitive boring gameplay, annoying bugs, worst A.I ever, and the multiplayer is pretty bad. Entertained me a bit, but not before that experience being ruined by a crappy bug or just getting bored. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had extremely low expectations going in for this game. After being patched and out for a while, I figured five bucks wasn't a big risk but it was a complete waste. The graphics are horrible, might be passable four or five years ago, but they're really bad and even the art style is bad. The gameplay is worse...The first alien I encountered sort of just sat there with his back turned to me while I shot him dead. The AI really is awful, your teammates are pretty useless. Aliens swarm at you in massive numbers, die easily, and look they've been hit by paintballs as they lie dead. I love the Aliens setting and thought I would give it a chance, but I can't even bring myself to play it, it's simply not fun at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the weakest shooters in recent memory. I have a hard time thinking of anything good to say about this game. In spite of how archaic the visuals are (easily below offerings that are nearly a decade old, such as Doom 3, Far Cry and Half-Life 2 to name a few), graphics are far from the biggest problem with this game. Anemic, popgun-like shooting, bland levels, lack of challenge and a plethora of bugs are far more pressing concerns. I would not recommend this title, not even to hardcore fans of the Aliens franchise. There's nothing to see here, even as pure fanservice it falls flat. It's not worth enduring Colonial Marines' below average gameplay to experience this "canon" continuation of the series, as you'll probably also end up disappointed by the retcons and sophomoric writing.

Strong candidate for worst game of 2013 and we're only in February. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously Gearbox? After the excellent Borderlands 2 I thought, it can't be wrong to pre-order another game produced by Gearbox. I was proven wrong. One thing I have learned for sure after this game release disaster: I will NEVER NEVER NEVER ever pre-order a game anymore! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be one of the worst games ever released for PC. The most honest and true review I found for this game can be found here at http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/12/wot-i-think-aliens-colonial-marines-single-player/ Please do not waste your money, time or effort with this game. The AI is so terrible that the enemies/aliens will run away from you or will stand still and let you shoot them. You take more damage from enemy humans with guns than you do aliens. The level design is horrible, all you are allowed to do is open doors and hit checkpoints. You can literally play this game on the hardest settings and run from checkpoint to checkpoint barely killing anything. This does not feel anything like ALIENS.

The graphics are circa 2005 and use Direct X 9, that's right... the game is very bright, and does not convey any sense of visual moodiness to it, at no point is there anything to shock or awe over as far as eye candy goes.

Factor in that there are terrible bugs found throughout the game, no dedicated servers for a bare bones multiplayer mode and you can easily tell hands down that this is probably going to win WORST GAME OF THE YEAR 2013. But hey dont take my word for it, Youtube a few videos for yourself and see the vast majority of other critics reviews. A lot of good people got fleeced when they bought this game, dont be one of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My opinion  Very poor. The graphics (which do not make a game good) are dire here with textures that seem to hark back to 2006 if not earlier. The campaign is nonsensical with terrible AI on both sides of the player and a plot line that seems to just make things up as it goes along and fail (although promises) to provide explanation. The NPCs, you just end up hating them, especially O'Niel who is meant to be "your guy". He either does nothing and just watches you battling moronic aliens or when he does shoot he seems to have forgotten his real smart gun and brought along his nerf version  utterly pointless. As for the voice acting, lets just say it's bad. I need to go back to the AI again here  because it's so poor, so bad, you have no feel at all of suspense or terror. The aliens are dumb (not that you'll end up fighting them much in this game). Instead of the creepy, could come from anywhere alien, they leap into the center of the room  and then barrel roll at you allowing you plenty of time to blow them away. If they actually manage to get close enough to you to hit you, they hit you once and then leap away, allowing you to blow them away  what's the point?

The multiplayer  as long as you're a marine you'll end up ok as the controls are easy and pretty much what you'd expect. As the alien you're completely screwed, the controls don't seem to work and nothing is fluid about it. When I try and wall climb my alien has a fit and I end up being shot for trying to play as an alien!!!

Good points  They've got the sound and music right, but was that really difficult?
- It works. It has yet to crash on me to be fair and everything seems to work the way it was meant too.
That's it.

There was so much opportunity with this game to offer up something great, the breath new life in to the Aliens franchise, but it was squandered. What could have potentially been Gearbox's best game turned out to be something they don't even seem to want to comment on except blame other developers and Sega. I think I can speak for fans when I say I would have preferred another 6 year delay and a good game rather than this copy and paste COD shooter that contains all the horror and suspense of a jar of pickled eggs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The campaign doesn't have the most cinematic quality nor does it's story seem genuinely riveting. It suffers from poor facial animations and has some low rez graphics but it is still a lovingly crafted Aliens game which is telling in it's set design, accurate to the movies and it's enemy AI and animation. NPCs are underdeveloped but this still has some of the best Alien animation, AI and avatars I've seen in any official game from the franchise. The bravado of the marines may seem distasteful or unrelated to the franchise at first but for real die-hard fans of the movie it's quite humorous and almost self-referential. The guns in this game are well crafted, compared to previous AVP outings, and feature the original sounds as well as a ton of customization.

The multiplayer looks promising, being based on asymmetrical games Like L4D and allows you the opportunity to play as a Xeno in 3rd person. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Colonial marines is example of the player saddening infection of heavy preordering of games makes the games less needy to be polished and well finished.
The more you preorder, the more you get unfinished games ,
ruined with business.
"hey guys finish this one fast, so we can sell another one already"﻿ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No comment. Oh, wait. So review has to contain at least 150 characters. Well, then: No comment, No comment, No comment, No comment, No comment, No comment,... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game seems really unpolished when it comes to mechanics. The aliens are derpy and often turn around and jump over crates when completely unnecessary, but when they get to you they pack an annoyingly powerful punch. if something is fast it should not be strong, two or three hits later and you're nearly dead. the aliens clip through the ground, glitch out so they're behind you, and are far too challenging to be fun. but the aliens aren't the worst part, oh no, its the other marines that are the problem. their AI sucks, they do way to much damage, they can blind-fire, and if you try to take cover, they  run up behind you and shoot you from behind. but you wouldn't know they where coming because you cant see over cover. seriously, the only way to shoot enemies is to stand up and expose half your body. but they also find ways to shoot you through cover, if you're behind a covered handrail, they'll shoot at your feet. seriously though, this is one of the only games i couldn't play because of how bad it is. i'm really reluctant to go back to playing this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is an awful game. Do not waste your time. This game is not worth your hard earned money. This was a money grab. Visuals 3/5, Mechanics 2/5, Story 1/5, Audio 2/5 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gearbox blew it here. This game is terrible.  I won't spend a lot of time wasted here describing the problems this piece of garbage has but suffice to say Operation Raccoon City is WAY better, Save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A major motion-picture-based shooter-on-rails? What could possibly go horribly, disappointingly, you-lied-to-me-wrong? Everything! I guess it makes sense why Randy Pitchford's voiceover in the teaser trailers (showing things that are nowhere near the final game) sounds like one of those pseudo-rapist characters from the websites where girls show up for a calendar shoot and are tricked into doing porn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything has already been said, but i wanted to add my vote onto the negative pile. For me the problem here is context. My group of friends buy and play a lot of games online as a way of keeping in touch. We often buy games we think arent 'great' e.g. Payday, i bought 4 passes for £12. We played it for a bit then moved on with the overall feeling "We had got great value for a fairly solid game". But, if you put a game into production for 6 years and leak demo's that are misleading. Then try and sell the half baked outcome for top coin when the game graphics/gameplay/AI and mechanics are no better than budget titles like Payday. It makes me mad. I doubt i will ever pre-order another game again. The only silver lining is that this game fails so greatly that there is still a gap in the market for a proper Aliens game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I made a account just to write the review, This is by far one of the biggest letdowns i have ever experianced, even bigger than the time you find out santa wasnt real. For those that think this is a worthy sequel to the movies are dead wrong, the story is so garbage, and even when you find out about a main character from the Aliens movie about how they got there he says and i quote "Well thats another story" a HUGE slap in the face for fans of the movie. The aliens dont feel like aliens, they run on the walls, jump off and jump right in front of your rifle making easy kills and turning them into cannon fodder, infact i found them to be so stupid i found fighting the mercs more harder, until you reach the spitters, In fact you keep fighting the mercs more than the aliens, WHICH IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO FIGHT IN A  ALIENS GAME! There are some positives in the game, One particular mission called The Raven i found to be fun and scary. In this mission you have your guns taken away and must escape a Large xeno which you cannot kill in any means until you reach the end, during this you are chased deeper into the sewer where you find what became of hudson and just after that you find tons of husks of zenomorphs only to find out that some are still alive and very dangerous, you must move silently and quietly through the sewer as these zenos are blind but will explode if they find you. The new guns they have added fit right in the game as if they were always there, the sounds are all genuine and locations are movie accurate...however that does not spare it from the horrible AI from both the enemy and your Ally team mates, not to mention the horrible story which should have never left the planning room, i hate to say this but this feels like a bait and switch if you saw the 2011 demo link here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7xFSYsy0rk 7:50 minutes in is the best example, when you do get to what could be that point in the game it is nowhere near as epic as shown in the demo.

The only real fun you can have is with the multiplayer, lots of customisation for both marines and xenos, not to mention grusome executions when playing as zeno. However even this is not worth the ammount of money they are asking. My only wish is that they will somehow be able to drag this out of the toliet and give this the love and attention that was shown in the 2011 demo.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is NOT a game! Because games are funny and pretty but this game is terrible. Please anyone not buy this game. Sorry Gearbox, not well, so terrible.I think "hah is this a game?" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

save yourself the frustration and money and buy something else,having pre ordered this i was expecting a reasonable quality game,considering all the hype and pre release videos,needless to say,i was conned.
utter garbage from a top shelf company.
the best thing about this game was the sound of the pulse rifle.
even with the patch,its hardly worth playing. Tombraider shows what a quality release should be,and this is just second rate at best.

A:CM to be avoided like the plague 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was waiting for this game since last year. I was hoping that this game will be good because there are lots of alien games to be release this year (crysis 3, dead space). I was really disappointed and was hoping a lot more from this franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward to 007 Legends since I'm a huge fan of 007 both the films and the games. But unfortunately, 007 Legends wins the title of the greatest disappointment of 2012. First, Daniel Craig isn't even in the game (they only used his likeness, not his voice). Speaking of the voice acting, it's as dull and uninspired as the one they did back in the late nineties when voice acting was still something new in games. Like the actors couldn't care. I'm not the kind of guy who compares every single shooter with Call of Duty. But it's hard not to compare 007 Legends with COD since every single aspect of its gameplay is identical. The stealth is awkward and you won't care if the guards spot you since it's much easier to go Rambo on them. The boss battles are the most scripted moments I've ever seen in a game. They don't have any challenge or sense of threat. By the end of them, you can simply put down your controller and see how the AI does everything for you. Supposedly, 007 Legends is a tribute to 007 in film, but it's more like a messed mash-up. When there's an iconic moment from a movie you feel the developers said "Hey! here's an iconic moment, moving on to the next" so they won't let you enjoy it. Every mission is a very synthesized version of a movie. Because of that, they missed some key scenes in them (Bond's infiltration of Sanchez's boat in Licence to Kill) or they last too short (Goldfinger's Aston Martin chase lasts less than 20 seconds). The guy who played Bond didn't even bother in saying "Bond, James Bond" when he was supposed to. The game doesn't even finish. You're supposed to wait for the Skyfall DLC to see its ending, so if you don't have an online connection you missed it. It's very obvious 007 Legends had an extremely rushed development, lacked the passion the creators spoke about in the interviews and why did EON approved this piece of trash with 007 name on it is beyond me. Not even worth for the Torrent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't believe the fake reviews - this is a really terrible game. The game mechanics are tired, the graphics suck, and it's extremely disconcerting to "relive" Jame Bond legendary experiences.. that not only never even happened, but take place in the present and star Daniel Craig. 007 Legends is more aptly-titled "Alternate Universe James Bond in a cheap CoD/Punch-Out Clone". Skip it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like Stronghold Crusader but this addon is nothing. Miserable work guys from Firefly ( or bosses who save money). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had the potential to be something amazing. With that said, this game has some of the worst framerate and controller lag I've ever experienced in my life. I want this game to be so fun, but if you're like me and cant get past lag every 15 to 20 seconds, and im talking about the worst lag you've ever expierenced, then dont waste your frusterations on this. Oh...and the graphics are low budget early Ps2 days bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Activision ruined this game. Not enough budget to the developers, and that resulted in this horrible game. Cauldron is more capable than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Now this is something unbelievable crap. I cant award the game more than just two points, because A) It hang up a few seconds after level got loaded and B) it sucks terribly technically. I was not able to choose any larger resolution than 800*600, and turning and moving was like in ten years old FPS games. Mouse sensitivity was terribly high and so on. I also had serious sound issues, barely could hear any game voices, just some random gibberish. One point for game starting up, second point for the notorious Soldier of Fortune name. Dont touch this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is an abomination to the other games in this awesome franchise.I don't know what they were thinking when they brought this game in to the world, I've played numerous made mods that are way better and less buggy than this. They have really overdone the gore on this game too, I guess that's because that is the only thing this game has to offer. If there will ever be another Soldier of Fortune game they should call it Soldier of Fortune 3 and just forget this piece of **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cheap iOS port of a pc game = painfully inadequate as a PC game. Especially for a major publisher.
Embarrassing for all parties involved and a disservice to the brand.
+1 since it is (mostly) functional, and +1 for the glimpses of DE:HR atmosphere.
Who the hell thought this was a good idea? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really a terribly bad game. Frustrating movement, and horrible gun mechanics make this near impossible to enjoy. It's only redeeming quality is the rag doll mechanics after a headshot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game lacks from soo much, it has some interesting stealth parts but other than that, its a broken down mess, the graphics are okay not the worst graphics but not the best either, the campaign is only 3 to 4 hours long and thats only if you die alot, which there are alot of cheap deaths, and worst of all, no one plays the multiplayer!!! so you have a game with a very very short campaign and after you complete it, theres nothing to do, dont even waste your money on it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only thing this game is good on is PISSING ME OFF! This game is just out right terrible! Every time someone mentions this game I just want to skin a cat! Well, maybe not that bad, but still Sniper Ghost warrior is a horrible game! One of the worst games I have ever played. Terrible graphics, horrendous controls, s###ty story, and a multiplayer that would make you go INSANE! I bought this game thinking that it will be a very good and well-managed sniper game and the thought of a sniper only game was ingenious. Instead it ended up being a huge flop! I should have known that this game was terrible when it was selling for $10 in a bargain bin. I don't even remember what your suppose to do even though I finished the whole game. The story is so forgettable! You won't care about the main character nor the other characters in the game. Do not buy this game! This game is just TERRIBLE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was just wanting to play a decent stealth sniper game, so I went to walmart and found one. Then I presumed to myself "Hey, this game looks fun. I should buy (WASTE) $20 of my hard earned cash." Well guess what, I can list 50 THINGS WRONG with this so called "game." The weapons are bad, the cut-scenes are somewhat freezing up, and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) is TERRIBLY HORRIFYING! One time, I was SILENTLY approaching a base and ACCIDENTALLY  shot the guy and two seconds later, I DIED! Not from my friend, but from a soldier 50 MILES AWAY... WITH AN AK-47! Oh, and another time, I was wandering around, and the TEXTURES are ROW RESOLUTION... FOR A 2010 GAME! But WAIT... That's not all. Not only do the enemy soldiers have 1 trillion mile thermal, (sarcastic) advanced guns that go to 50 miles, (sarcastic) BUT THE VOICE ACTING! Raw lip synching is what is suffers. The only time it ACTUALLY WORKS is during the OCCASIONAL FREEZING CUT SCENE!
----
Don't buy this game, You're better off buying a cheap Airsoft pistol. But hey, the game is not so but about 2% of the time. I wasted my time, but PLEASE, I don't want YOUR time too! Go buy a better game that's WORTH you time, money. and reaches your entertainment levels. The final vertic is a 2/10; A horrible game. These people need to do better. I am going to literally pee on this game and BREAK IT then flush it down the toilet where it freaking belongs. Thank you for reading my review... See you next time! Bye. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What are they doing? At least the movie is worth seeing. They really need to just stick to the movies  This game is really like a crappy version on mass effect 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hands down one of the worst games I've played on the PS2. It's just so ... cheap. Besides ripping off Sid Meier, the game suffers from not providing enough direction as to what you're supposed to do, cheap CGI scenes, boring music and, the most annoying thing, NPC's that talk like adults in a Charlie Brown Christmas special. If you don't want to have spoken dialogue, don't have them make any noise. That simple. The only redeeming thing about the game is that the combat system isn't horrendous, but it's not good enough to want you to keep playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun but suffers from free to play. $150 asking price? Why not polish and sell retail at $60? Insane greedy publishers? 10/10. Worth an all nighter but no more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is all about the PERKS and Weapons. Skill not required. Its painful to get the special perks MOA 3 and Argon's rage 3 which requires days or weeks of dedicated play. Ontop of this the Vulcan Helm gives a major advantage, but was only sold during a limited time frame.

Without the Key weapons and Perks, you have no chance of winning. Nice try but you missed the mark on what a comp fighting game should be, with balance fighters 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is mediocre at best. Nothing about it leaves a good taste in my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED the series, and I've spent eight hours trying to find some hint of a decent game. I can't. The fighting is simple and uninteresting, the graphics are abysmal, (this is 2013, not 2001) progression is slow and tedious, because they were trying to get as many pointless little fights in as they could before you beat this, to simply put it, short game. Not to mention one of the worst launches I've experienced. Recruiting on PS3 was broken for the first day, and the servers on Xbox were down nearly immediately. I'd hate to say this about a game that was made based around one of my favorite TV series' of all time, but I honestly think you should avoid this garbage at all costs. Just because it's free doesn't mean you can make the game trashy and boring. 4/10. And that's being generous because I liked the series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very interested in playing this game. ....Biggest mistake ever. Bad graphics, lame characters, annoying music, tedious battle systems, all-around confusing, and completley boring. Horrible new inovations in this game, that i hope never see the light of day again. And i hate the way you move your character. There are so many downsides to this game, it's hard to even think of a single good thing. Thbe plot stinks too! Really squaresoft....tisk tisk. Enhergiez was unfinished...but fun, final fantasy 9 was dissapointing...but still ok, but this time you've gone too far, this game is ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good ideas, interesting story, characters. Bad execution. I didn't know that the beloved people at Square, responsible for masterpieces like Final Fantasy 7 and 10, could do this. Maybe it's Enix. Let's just hope that upcoming projects (Kingdom Hearts 2, FF11, and hopefulyl an FF 7-2) do not suffer from the same flaws that Unlimited Saga did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks can't believe squaresoft made it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't buy it if you expect Dungeon Keeper. In fact, just don't buy it.
The gameplay is extremely tedious, and it's just a sad waste of time. It feels and looks like a lot of effort went into its production, but it doesn't matter because the gameplay isn't cohesive, and it's not fun at all.
I have a serious feeling that the "10" reviews are friends and family of the developers... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A poor game. Bugs have so far forced me to repeat all of Act I, as well as my current mission 3 times over due to seemingly random freezing up. Even frequent saving did not help  saves turned out to be unusable. Their tech support forum says these are "known bugs", but IMHO these things should have been fixed before the game was released to the public. I could forgive the technical issues if the gameplay is good, but, frankly, it isn't. The strategy element of the game is severely lacking in depth, and appears poorly thought through. Example: treasure chests can spawn mobs that take 4 squads to kill, and reward 25 treasure. A basic treasure quest also offers 25 treasure, but only requires you fight a single level 1 mob. That isn't remotely balanced. Another example: squads can restore themselves by eating food at a kitchen, but even when they're starving they will never eat without explicit orders to do so from you. Even then you have to order each squad individually. Makes no sense, and heavy on the micromanagement. Overall, this is a game with many bugs, but little strategy, and these two things combine to ruin it. It does have some upsides  like the great character dialogue which while cheesy is fun to read, but they aren't enough to save a poor game like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gamers have to stop accepting and buying games that are poorly developed and published as money grabbing items. This game is boring and the AI is non-existent. You build a dungeon but your minions just stand around until you tell them to do anything (unlike dungeon keeper games). This game is similar to the aliens:colonial marine game where the developers do not actually develop the game play into an unique experience. The structure of your dungeons does not matter at all as you can just teleport your troops everywhere. It is an unfinished game and released to grab easy profits.Please stop buying these terrible releases. A continuation of the genre called "unfinished masterpiece" that started with Warz and Aliens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull, repetitive, shallow, and buggy. The voice acting is fun but is not enough to save the title from the horrific flaws with the game play. The game taunts you with an appealing story and hints at a satisfying dungeon-builder, but never quite delivers. The constraints on building prevent you from truly designing your dungeon freely and the endless cycle of hero invasions and ladder attacks quickly turn into endless drudgery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Es una lastima que un juego con tanto potencial como lo pudo ser este, se limitase solo a un multijugador de mediana calidad y una historia, cuyo único requisito para jugarla es pagar USD 9.99 y que según las reseñas de paginas especializadas es un modo de juego mediocre. Lastima por este juego, que se veía mas prometedor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A criminally bad game. If I had to choose one word to describe the game, I would choose, “torture”. It consists of everything people hate in games: incomprehensible timed puzzles, save points before cut scenes, obnoxious controls you name it. Extremely annoying and unforgiving. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Has potential. but totally unfinished game. most things dont work right or at all. many things mentioned in the manual / box dont exist in the game at all. save your money for something else. and be wary of anything else from dreamcatcher interactive. they will charge you to beta test their unfinished stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the genre, but this game is horrible. un-skippable docking animations, that take a very long time, an utterly unbearable tutorial, and being attacked at the most inappropriate times. poor voiceovers, the constant background chatter that serves no purpose, a truly garbage game. The game features the mos annoying GUI i have ever come across, say, for example, you have the map open to find your way to a station, it seems reasonable that said map would hide while the next interface appears, doesn't it?

Starpoint Gemini obviously doesn't. if you dock with your map open, prepare to sit through the undocking and re-docking animations, just to click a button. But even then the station interface is unintuitive and useless. it offers only the basic information, snd does its best to hide that.

But the combat, the one thing that I thought may save this game, is truly terrible. fly near a station to trade? nope, 9/10 times you will be attacked, and combat mode will automatically activate, slowing you right down, to eliminate any chance of escape, and stop you from docking. If you dare press the button to deactivate combat mode, and accelerate away, you will be instantly shot, slowed down, leaving you the only option to fight, just to sell a carrot.

This game is the pitiful reason why publishers stay away from this genre, ill-made attempts like this just screw it over. Luckily, publisher Iceberg interactive has many other far better space sim games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival fails at being an interesting party game and at being an Animal Crossing game. While the game maintains some of the wit and charm of the mainline games, it is drowned out by the mundane and RNG reliant gameplay. As a die hard Animal Crossing fan I cannot recommend this game to either fans of the series or people wanting to try out the series for their own. This game is not worth the $60 price point either, while you may argue "Oh it comes with two amiibos!" you cannot advance past the start screen without an Animal Crossing Amiibo, locking you out of the game unless you own one. It feels as if Nintendo dragged a very prominent series through the mud just for the sake of selling Amiibos. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Amiibo Festival falls severely short of other similar party games and offers very little to players. For a series that heavily features customization this game feels lacking.
The first two games you play do not feature any minigames (unless you count turnip selling) and the game does not inform you that these features even exist until you finish that second game. Overall the gameplay is quite dull - I found myself playing on my phone for most of the time because there was nothing to look at - I didn't have to be worried about where other players were because there is barely any competition to the game and it is very hands off - all you do is tap your amiibo figure to take your turn and occasionally buy and sell turnips. I came in expecting it to be similar to Mario Party where there was a minigame after each round of turns. Instead it was an endless moving around of the board with very little choice, interaction, or even consequences.
The other Animal Crossing games offer so much and I was hoping we would see some of these great things integrated into the game. Instead minigames must be unlocked after they're finally revealed to you. So far it seems like customization is really limited for the 8 preset human players for those who do not play with an amiibo figure. The series features a large amount of music - which is quite absent from this game that has a limited and disappointing soundtrack.
On the bright side the game is cute and the amiibos are adorable. I dislike Wii controllers so at first I was happy to discover you only needed the gamepad - but then I realized it was because there were no minigames or other activities that required you to all play at the same time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's cute, graphics are as good as a wii u game gets.  I just wished it had more sustenance.  I got the game as a bday gift, I only played it for 10 min by myself, my best friend came over (also an ac fan) tried to play at least a 2 player mode, passing the game pad back and fourth is annoying, and seeing that there was no other amiibo functionality it was just boring and repetitive. Too bad I cant return it :( I did return my Tom nook amiibo.  I dont even want to have them as a collectible its so bad . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nintendo HAD to have known this was going to flop. I love Animal Crossing and cannot wait for the next actual Animal Crossing game. This is a waste of money and should only be purchased by collectors, the way they should own a copy of E.T. for NES.

As soon as I had played for about an hour, I got this eerie feeling that Nintendo published this game as a way to pay for any extra toilet paper they may need in their offices. It's the only thing I can think of. I tried really hard to like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival is exactly what the title states. It is a game that exists purely to sell Amiibos and this is actually the first title that I can recall that actually requires the use of these figures. The gameplay is essentially Mario Party is Mario Party had nothing worthwhile to offer. There are no minigames, no extras to unlock really, just a pointless run around of a board. It is repetitive beyond belief and I was bored after just one game. What makes all of this sting even mroe is that the presentation is fantastic. It has the Animal Crossing style down perfectly and that really makes me wish this was a better game, but instead we get such a terrible and boring experience that I question why it even exists. OH WAIT, to sell Amiibos. Awesome, thanks Nintendo.  This game is a testament to what will happen if Nintendo goes crazy with the Amiibos concept. Stay far away, I recommend jsut picking up the Amiibos themselves if you are a huge Animal Crossing fan like me. The figures at least look really nice. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

*snores* mmmmhhh...AH! I fell asleep playing animal crossing amiibo festival yet again! That's the 1,584,535,430th time! This game is boring and a waste of time. Nintendo made this game just to sell more amiibos. The graphics are good though and the game does have a bit of animal crossing charm but overall this is a terrible excuse for a great series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

que clase de pendejada es esta, tengo que comprar amiibos para disfrutar el juego al maximo, o es la copia barata de mario party, no lo se, no lo jueguen menos mal que no compre esta basura de hecho me lo regalaron y lo vendi de lo malo que era es porqueria recien hecha 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is an insult to the Inyasha series. You would have to be a huge fan-girl to enjoy it. Im an Inuyasha fan, I read the new chapter each week, I even have my own Inuyasha homepage, but this game just shouldn't have been made. :P 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is frustratingly awful. I had a hard time with every level glitching out and killing me time after time. The loading time though annoying is manageable except for the pointless parts where it takes you to a three second piece of dialogue in betwen loading screens! The graphics for being an early xbnox 360 and ps3 game, are pretty decent. The music is okay too. But the combat for silver and all characters aside from shadow and sonic are just awful. That is why it gets a two and that's pushing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Despite some solid visuals, the game is awful, broken, and unfinished. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even from someone or somebody who hasn't played the game, falling through levels, interrupted controls, self minded cameras, and 20 second load times times 4 to a total of 1 minute and 20 seconds from other people trying to play this mess is just enough for us to decide if we want to play this. This is easily the worst Sonic game. If this was released in 2007, if would've fine. But, no. I guess it's not worth the effort on solving the game's problems. Princess Elise kissing Sonic will make you regret on watching that Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. The music and Silver the Hedgehog are the only best parts in the game. Silver is actually one of my favorite Sonic characters later on. The music is so great that Sega should reuse it for later games, just like they did on Sonic Generations. Sonic '06 went on and became non-canon to the series' continuity, but that's for the best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me say this: I am a hardcore Sonic fan, and I generally like most Sonic games. When I played this though, I caught every single disease in the world. THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE.OK, this game does have a couple of good things, like the soundtrack is good and one of the levels is fun. And that's it.Otherwise, the level design is terrible - it just doesn't work, and is sometimes way to hard. The levels are also extremely long - Sonic levels should not last 20 MINUTES. The loading screens - ugh, not only do they last around 25 seconds EACH, but you encounter them EVERYWHERE. And I'm not joking. I was about to play a mission, so a loading screen came up. I suppose that is acceptable. But then, ONE sentence appeared after that loading screen, and once you read that, ANOTHER LOADING SCREEN CAME! Plus, the game is extremely glitchy - I ran into a wall, Sonic stopped, I lost control over the character and shooted straight off the screen. The glitches are even gamebreaking - they are that bad. And the engine is just plain weird - Sonic is very slow, and some of his moves, like the homing dash, do not make sense. When Sonic does a homing dash in other games, he does the dash in mid air, then builds up some momentum after he does that as he falls to the ground. In this game, he does the dash, and then he drops the the floor like a stone. It's annoying, especially if you are trying to reach a further-away area. Plus the dash only reaches a very short distance, so it isn't even worth it. The story is stupid, too - it's confusing and just down-right silly, making no sense whatsoever. Not only that, but Sonic get's KISSED BY A HUMAN. That is the most disgusting, vile sight ever in video-gaming history.This game is a horrible game and I hope you take my word for it. Trust me - it may seem great when you watch other people play it, but once you actually hold the controller, you will throw up. I hate this game and please, please PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON IT. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic the Hedgehog has been a likable character since the days of the Sega Genesis. Sonic Adventure started out in the Dreamcast and became one of the most successful games on the platform in the mid 1990's. Up until now has Sega released a poorly optimized Sonic game that doesn't stand its own ground thanks to its clunky gameplay and its unfair lives system.

You start off by choosing three stories that all have to be completed before you face the final boss of the game. You start off by choosing three main characters; Sonic, Shadow, and Silver. Sure all of these characters maybe fun to play as when you first get the feeling, then comes the gameplay. I personally start off with Sonic to play as first.

The game starts off with a cutscene that looks like a Final Fantasy game; the human characters look atrociously animated and does not feel like you are a playing a Sonic game. A princess named Elise is kidnapped by Dr. Eggman, Sonic must chase and look for princess Elise before anything else goes wrong. The game introduces more characters along the way; such as Tails, Kunkles, Amy etc.

After you finally gain control of Sonic, the game feels extremely sensitive to the controls in which you are controlling. For example, if you slightly tilt the controller, Sonic will walk at a normal pace, but if you hold it all the way forward, he will run so fast that it is really difficult to control him and you will very likely die at multiple sections of the game due to the sensitive controls and movement of Sonic. There are mini-games you can play in the town you are placed in, but why play them? Choosing to accept a mini-game will put you in a twenty second loading screen to read of a short description of that mini-game, but then you have to wait another twenty seconds then fully begin the mini-game. The mini-games themselves don't do very much to help you out; if you could get complete a mini-game in the given time you are supposed to beat, you will be given currency to buy items that could potentially help out Sonic in his quest.

Then there are the HUB worlds, which are not all that great unfortunately. The first level starts out exciting with Sonic going using a loop-de-loop; then he slides on the water to go on the beach to continue the level. The game wants you to have high expectations for the rest of the game, and if does a really great job at that. At one part in the level, you start playing as Tails. Tails is way more sensitive than Sonic, he has a flying ability that is just as clunky as Sonic's movement. Then he has this attack that he uses to throw rings that are used as a bomb. I died multiple times due to a substantial amount of glitches throughout the level. For example, I was playing as Sonic at one point, I noticed this loop I could run up, when I tried going up the loop, I instead teleported somewhere in the water and then drowned and lost a life (which by the way, hedgehogs in real life can swim).

Then I get to the second part of the level where I only have two lives left. I had no idea what I was supposed to do, and the game doesn't explain what is going on. Basically you are placed in a auto-scroller, Sonic moves all by himself and runs so fast that you can only move him left and right. Sonic runs so fast that you literally have to push left or right on your controller to get him where he needs to go. Unfortunately, I lost all of my lives on this section because I hit something and died in one hit, even though I had rings left as health. I lost another life when I was going up on a loop, Sonic was running too close to the left that when he was at the end, he missed the speed-booster and ended up falling in the water, leading me to start the entire start of the game all over again.

I attempted to try and beat this level five times and never got past it. I did try Shadow and Silver's story, but thy are just as broken as Sonic's. As Shadow, he is more sensitive than Sonic, I could assume this because he moves like he is wearing roller-blades. As Silver, he uses a telekinesis power that I thought was unique to his character, but its hit detection is what makes it unbearable to use. Just some examples that could have worked and what could have made the game so much more better.

The original soundtrack for the game is one of the things I actually liked about the game; it could go from very calming to very intense depending on what level you are on. I also liked how you could play multiple characters and all have a different story; I won't spoil anything, but I did find the characters' stories to be interesting and that we get to learn their backstories and what their problems are.

Sega could have made this highly anticipated work. Sonic fans will surely be disappointed by frustrating gameplay and the terrible controls. We will have to see what Sega brings to us next on Sonic's 25th anniversary, maybe they will make the ultimate comeback and bring us a well-though Sonic game for everyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A barely playable mess of a game, Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 plays as if it was programmed by monkeys and unfolds as if its narrative was conjured up by a fifteen year old. You'll fall through floors, walk up walls and plummet down bottomless pits countless times. New addition to the series Silver the Hedgehog is as annoying as ever, with gameplay that, in theory, sounds fantastic, but in practise is both frustrating and boring. As with Shadow the Hedgehog, this is another Sonic Team title that has only the accompanying soundtrack going good for it. If Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 were to be represented as a mighty tower, it would've fallen down long before workers had even finished building it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Please kill me it hurts to live.

Who let this happen? Who actually tested this and thought "wow, this game isn't utterly awful, I should unleash this upon the general populace"

Buy this if you like: terrible broken controls, ridiculous glitches and a camera that seems to realise what an awful game it's in and then proceeds to try and escape from its own personal hell.

Do not buy if you like: Having fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game.
Burn it. Explode it. Bury the remains.
The only thing this "GAME" has to offer is the...Okay-level voice acting.
its...not good...at all... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** anyone who would play this raging game i feel like a have a angerism god this game is the devil spawn anyone who wants to buy this game die in a hole you cock sucking smug prick  you sonic **** boys 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a Sonic fan and i really like the series, but seriously, are you **** kidding me Sega?! The characters has bad movements, the voice acting is bad and Eggman is... thin. Oh come on!!! I give it a 2 only because i like the soundtrack. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games ive ever played. The animation and music were OK, and that's it. That's just it.
The game was so  beginner unfriendly. Its kind of like this: Thanks for buying Sonic 06! Now do a speedrun level and learn all the controls and physics for this game. I got to what I think was the 2nd level, and then got trapped in a hole I couldn't escape. After a few minutes of trying to escape, I realized this game was bad and I haven't played it since. Not a good 2012 Christmas present, don't buy this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game functions. That is the only good thing I can say about this game. Heck half the time the game doesnt even do that. This should be avoided with every ability a human being has.

*PORTUGUESE REVIEW*

Difícil dizer se  bom ou não

Esse game  baseado no seguinte: ou você o odeia, ou você o ama, não tem jeito de fazer análises para este game, mas eu irei tentar fazer uma o mais justa possível:

Jogabilidade: Esse que  um dos pontos mais fracos do game, a jogabilidade  mais ou menos, embora alguns bugs que não atrapalham, há também muitos bugs que atrapalham, os bugs não me atrapalharam, mas eu tenho certeza que já atrapalhou várias pessoas. Se esse quesito fosse trabalhado melhor, não seria um dos pontos fracos do game

História: Outro ponto fraco do game  a história, ela  muito confusa, mas aos poucos você vai entendendo, mas mesmo assim ela não  tão boa, uma parte ruim da história,  que Sonic tem que salvar Elise, uma princesa do jogo, toda hora, isso  estranho, sei lá, não combina com Sonic, acho que se a história fosse trabalhada melhor não seria tão ruim assim.

Gráficos: Um dos pontos fortes do jogo, os gráficos são muito encantadores e belos, às vezes dá vontade de ficar só andando pela fase, observando os cenários, fica mais bonitos ainda usando um cabo HDMI.

Música: Essa sim  a melhor parte do jogo, as músicas! São ótimas e viciantes, sempre antes de eu jogar este jogo, eu escuto as músicas desse game nos extras do game.

Conclusão: Esse jogo, você tem que decidir, pessoas gostaram do game (como eu) mas reconheceram seus pontos fracos, outras já o odeiam, e consideram a ovelha negra dos jogos do Sonic. Só acho errado falar que este game  "injogável" tem jeito de jogar este jogo, se você treinar, você pode o jogar melhor, o problema  quando as pessoas ficam irritadas com o game, não jogam nem um pouco e já saem falando na internet que o jogo  lixo, este game pode ser considerado pelo menos mediano e não um lixo.

Pontos positivos: Gráficos impressionantes; Músicas encantadoras.
Pontos negativos: História confusa; Muitos bugs 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yack, that's almost everything you need to say about this piece of crap. I'm a Sonic-fan and this unfinished garbage really hurts my black soul. Still I can say I like the overall level design - in rare moments it has the same feeling like the Adventure-titles have - and musics are pretty nice. Everything else, well, is **** Nothing more to say. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sonic '06... Sonic '06... oh my gosh. Ten years later, and it is still a terrible, broken, and sometimes unfinished mess. I know this game was rushed and development started right after Shadow's game and Sonic Team had to adjust to the new Xbox 360 and PS3 hardware and it was Sonic's 15th anniversary, but seriously? Why? I know Sonic gets anniversary titles like the 10th anniversary title Sonic Adventure 2 and the 20th anniversary title Sonic Generations (and whatever he's getting for his 25th, which, at the time of this review, has not been announced yet), but couldn't they have just delayed it a year to perfect their game?

This game contains a terrible plot, broken gameplay, plot holes, and horrendous voice direction. The story here is just, just awful. Sonic saves newcomer Elise so many times (and that's his story, I'm serious), Shadow deals with a new villain named Mephiles (that's his whole story), and newcomer Silver deals with new villain Iblis (and again, that's it). When their stories are (somehow) beaten, you unlock the last story. It's terrible, but I will admit, the final boss is alright. And that's it. I will not spoil the last story for you, for some reason. I just don't like to talk about spoilers if somebody else hasn't experienced it.

The gameplay is alright, but cheap. Sometimes, you'll just do a homing attack so far, you'll fall into a bottomless pit. Jumping onto other rails doesn't work.

There are some things I honestly love. The art direction, the graphics, and the music are honestly fantastic. Everything else, well, isn't.

Sonic '06 had potential to be great. If only SEGA had given Sonic Team more development time.

[ Edited on 2/2/2017 ] Sonic the Hedgehog on the Xbox 360... before we can get started with the many flaws that made this game a failure, we have to experience how hard this should have been for the Sonic Team if this wasn't rushed to selected marketplaces. Sure, there were great things about it, but that amount of great things is the rarity of a blue moon. Playing this without discovering a bug is nearly impossible and will nearly kill your playtime in pieces. Not only are the glitches the only thing terrible about this. It's the unbearable relationship between human and hedgehog. I'm very glad Elise doesn't appear in any more installments of the franchise but it makes me want to grab a team to make a spin-off game about her only. Silver's introduction was nearly rough and bumpy. Again, you can't deny that the music here is great, but this music can't save a broken game anyways so why bother. Hopefully, the Sonic Team has learned their lessons after this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this game a 2 just because of the graphics, i tried to have fun with this game, but with the bad game play and the story line was hard as hell to follow. the 5 bucks i payed would have been better spent on some barbie game , J/k SAVE UR MONEY , GO GET SOME ICE CREAM. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is nothing to like here, the music distortion is not fun to do at all, and the rest of the "game" is watching one of about 15 animations of weird things (such as a man's head morphing into a balloon). At least Linger in Shadows was beautiful to look at. This game has nothing. Aside from a few trophies it's not worth the few dollars it costs 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't think a game can get simpler. This is even a disgrace to the bargain rack. With almost no motion control,and very simple challenges, this game should have been advertised to younger children. The tap dancing is slow paced and uses only the d-pad. Not to mention that it is another DDR ripoff. This is one of those games that gave licensed titles a bad rap. Avoid this mess at all costs- Nintendo made a mistake approving this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the worst fighting game available on the 360, and it's a real shame too. As a long time veteran of the series, I had hoped to see our heroes make a much better transition into 3D. It is hardly what you would call a button-masher, but neither can you give it credit for being technical, either. The input window is a bit too lenient to feel like you are in precise control of the character, and yet the animation itself lacks any type of fluidity. Perhaps SNK should have abandoned the 3D idea altogether, and given us another 2D fighter, like the rest of their excellent games. I recommend leaving this one alone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Possibly the most infamous game out there well to me any way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As somebody who loves dinosaurs, and was around to see the original Primal Carnage develop and grow, I am utterly disappointed. Not because the game is bad, not because I didn't enjoy it when I first played it, but because there are absolutely NO dedicated servers, you cannot play any match without other players teleporting across the screen, your hits missing, and you dying from hits you can't even see a lot. This is game breaking, and honestly trashes what could vbe an amazing game. I can't even pull my PS4 close to the router to get a better connection, that's how bad the server system is. Until this game receives a better way to play, it's a crippled online shooter, and deserves no good reviews for it. Sorry to say, because I love dinosaurs and dinosaur video games, but I am totally and utterly stunned nobody thought that "Hey, maybe our server system might get in the way of gameplay."

I'm giving this game 2 stars only because it is a good game, when your connection is also good. Some matches I've played were quite enjoyable, however most of the time they are not. Do not buy this game unless something changes in how it's games are set up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was actually one of the 3 people who was actually anticipating this game. When you read a description of it (flightsim/RPG), you're just SO intrigued by the possibilities. Sadly, the game is completely unplayable in manual mode. Completely. The only way to be able to successfully 'fly' is to switch on the autopilot and just point at enemies for the computer to shoot down. Not fun AT all. Avoid like the plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

worst game i played in my life . i feel good for the player that got this pile of FPS  rip off  for free or found it on their computer.DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good idea but unfortunately poorly implemented. Its just too hard to control, i felt like I had more control in skate 2 and it uses a controller! This could have been a really good game but is it a complete downgrade from the other tony hawk titles, which I actually had fun playing. I ended up having more fun just doing flip tricks with the board on my carpet 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel robbed! Seriously, I am £90 shorter and a very upset and annoyed gamer. Tony Hawk was once one of the finest gaming franchises around, with games such as Pro Skater 3 and the original Underground being two of the finest video games I have ever played. Now look at what the Tony Hawk series has become. A mockery of what was once a top franchise! Skate 2 not only beats this in terms of a skating experience, but murders it, rips it's head off and throws it in a skip! Mr Hawk, maybe it's time you went back to the Underground series and forget this gimmicky tripe. The graphics are low-par PS2 standard at best. The gameplay is broken, theres no other word for it. And whilst the board is an... well, I guess "interesting" addition to Skateboarding games, it just dosen't work well enough to warrent nearly 100 of your hard earned pounds! Buy the original Underground for a fiver and it'll still be 10x the experience this is. Jeez! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just played this round at my friend's house, and was expecting a more realistic and interesting reboot of the franchise. My last Tony Hawk game was back in the early PS2 days, before the milking started, and I fully loved it. But now? This game was a true disappointment. The skating is fixed on rails (in casual mode) or very hard to control (speaking as someone who used to skate a little way back in the day). I can add nothing sensible to the comments made in some of the professional reviews, as they seem to have covered everything, but I just want to say that, regardless of the future promise of the peripheral, this game is a let down. I gave it 2 points for trying something new. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My brother got this for his birthday...boy he was happy to get his first ONLINE PS2 game...he went online and literally there was about 20-30 people online. That's horrible. He doesn't have fun with it, and he's Seven years old. Why even bring this game online? No one was on, text entry with display keyboard takes literally forever, and it takes a while to even say Hi or hello...considering he's seven and doesn't know a keyboard well, especially one on the tv. When I had a quick go at it, the minigames were boring, and had sloppy controls. Is this a Mario Party Online? No, nothing even close to a Mario Party online, 7 minigames that weren't even Mario Party quality...well maybe dodgeball was but that's about it. MP had about 70 something... Stay away from this game like the dreaded plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

a game that makes warhammer 40k fire warrior look good. stagnant gameplay & 'dumb' lead you by the hand maps inter spaced with carefully planned 'encounters' and clips from the original movie. a trully painful and horrible gaming experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The games camera is what killed it for me. Not worth the $50 bucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its sad that this continues the weak attempt to project the RPG Tabletop experience that one has in D&D the table top game, but it was a nice attempt.  I like games but still cant connect the name here with the original at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terribly disappointing because I wanted desperately for this game to be good.  I am such a big fan of the Action RPG dungeon crawler genre that I made the mistake of getting this game before hearing any opinions.  I loved Baldur's Gate and Champions of Norath, but this game is a lackluster knockoff that does not live up to the standard those games set, even though released years after the superior predecessors.  Very poor sound, a restrictive and frustrating camera in which your view gets blocked or darkened out, chunky and clumsy gameplay and combat, and a boring sense of "been there, done that", all the while with the pain of buyer's remorse that it has been done better before.  Unfortunately the most numerous bugs in the game are not the kind that you can slash, shoot, or blast into chitinous goo, but technical flaws and failures that plague the game engine and presentation.   It is not fun to slash away constantly at countless and irritating inanimate barrels.  The appeal of its source material, D&D, is a sense of freedom and excitement as you feel clever coming up with unconventional ways of solving problems using the ever expanding skills of your character in odd and creative ways.  Nothing could be further from the experience here.  It feels more like a chore than entertainment as you plod through the linear affair.  A 2 if played by yourself, a 4 if played with friends, so I settled for a score of 3.  Ultimately a complete waste of Microsoft Points and an insult to the a genre which deserves so much better.  If the slightest amount of innovation or vision is excersised, this genre completely rocks.  Torchlight, a fine diablo clone, blew it with no cooperative play.  Now we will have to look to Dungeon Siege III and hope it does not screw the pooch as Daggerdale did.  In the meantime, you will have much more fun picking up Baldur's Gate or Champions of Norrath (or either of their sequels) for another playthrough rather than suffering through dreaming of what Daggerdale could have been. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sucked worse than a cold McGriddle. So much potential, like Lindsay Lohan pre-Mean Girls. Insulting for anyone whom appreciates the franchise or who are smarter than Lenny from 'Of Mice and Men' 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Regarding the DS version: Bad save points, obstacle courses and puzzles that expect you to correctly tap minuscule areas and buttons with amazing precision the first time through, unlockables that have little to no value whatsoever... It's quite clear to me that this game was simply yet another cash-in on the Star Wars name. No matter how much your children beg you for this game, don't buy it. Pretty much the only good point here is that the touch screen is used slightly more effectively than the previous Clone Wars game. Not recommended whatsoever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was interesting for the first three levels untill you find that there is no freedom and that any of the unlockables are silly looking hats or masks from the series. I would recommend that LucasArts go down to Mexico and have this brain child aborted before it destroys the franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lucas Arts was either brain dead by the time they made this game or just gave up on themselves because this game sucks. The game was completely unimaginative and the characters are unbalanced (Padawan is stronger then Anakin, I swear...) and about as weak C-3PO. The environment was tiny and boring, and some maps tended to be ridiculously hard to complete. There was almost no story line but the graphics were okay. I recommend this game to the dump. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ok so ive played a lot of psp games and beaten a whole lot and Transformers i had looked up a long time before it came out and i was really anxious to buy the game so i did i got home started playing it after about 5-7 minutes i was done although later i eventually beat the game with ease it was just an overall pretty horrible game the controls arent that great and the storyline kinda sucks now i know my psp games and this next to gangs of london and jackass is probably the worst one 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played Cities Xl (last game) previously and i was sort of satisfied. Yesterday i got my anticipated Cities XXL and played for around 10hours before writing this. Believe it or not, i am planning to uninstall it cs it a total wastage of my disk space. It nothing but a small add-on or DLC which should not cost more than 4USD(my personal opinion), but they are charging a whole 39.99USD at steam(dated 6th February,2015) for newcomers and a 50% off for Cities XL owners, which is in my view a complete BANK JOB. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to try a game that seemed to have a lot of effort put into it, but that many people considered "terrible" and, well, yeah, there was a reason everyone thought this game just wasn't worth the time. My biggest issue is that the presentation of the game is misleading. I approached the game with an open mind but then, immediately, I felt cheated. So, do what I didn't initially do: learn from others. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game. The graphics are horrific. Still blocked traffic at certain draw distances, until you zoom in and can see actual models. Upgrading road networks still a horror show. There is very little progression as you can just splat down a lot of housing and even more industry and just keep topping up until they are happy. No real benefit to decorating or beautifying the surroundings. Bus lines are still bugged. It's an abomination to be honest. Why they are charging people full price I will never know. It is worth a play through if you have never played the previous titles in the series, but do not be expecting to have fun. It's a chore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with all of the negative reviews for this game,  is is ridiculous how much it costs  for so little, there is almost no difference  between Xl XXL at most is should maybe $5-10 for this, and it should be a expansion pack instead of a standalone.

As much as I hate the price and the lack of new features, I must say some good things with this.
The new engine does fix some lagging issues that are existent in XL and the interface is easier to use. An example bridges have there own section now and is easier and not as time consuming. The view options they have added a nice feature which allows you to change the look of the sky (Sunny, Cloudy) etc.

But overall not worth buying your better off just keeping with XL 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

X-Men: Destiny had such great promise; unfortunately it failed dismally in delivering on it...

You start out by choosing one of three youngsters oblivious to their mutant abilities and predictably once a horrific event takes place you discover you them. Throughout the course of the game you make various choices to help you expand upon these abilities. To keep it simple the game uses a mix of choices at key moments and a simple "Power branch system" in order to define what powers you utilise and which you will expand on. This sounds fantastic, but it's not really. The main power choices are pretty limited and result in much the same thing whichever way you go. The "Sub Powers" allow you to define the type of attack and defence modifiers each of your chosen powers has, e.g. Pyro's fire or Colossusâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

instead of a sequel to Eternal Darkness we get this?  Total crap, it's like a title like Mass Effect with low cost budget values. Just skip it until it's 25.00 bucks or less anything more is a crime against the human world. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible game. A ton of glitches, couldn't understand what was happening in the clips at all. Plus it is impossible to get all the canasters seriously i've tried for a LONG TIME! The most percentige I have ever got was 97% and it gets boring after the first level, but the worst thing in that game is the sand box. It doesen't even make a little sence! and you can't even do dagobah. Lastely that game can make you so mad, yet it can make you laugh so hard, because it's so messed up! Overall TERRIBLE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just a few words:  pathetic and crap game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a huge fan of Adventure Time, I was excited there was a videogame and even more excited they had some additional characters for purchase (i.e. Peppermint Butler! yay!). My boyfriend and I sat down to play the co-op and quickly learned that after a few charming conversations between characters - this is the most formulaic game imaginable. Every level is the same; the controls are very clunky (ranged weapons can only deal damage if you are directly horizontal or directly vertical to an on-screen villain despite having full 360 degree movement). The characters aren't very customizable either, having the same few categories of gifts between them... each character has a special attack, but it becomes old news quick. There are a few charming bits of dialogue (I laughed at being addressed by villains as "hello one or more players!") but beyond that, it was a huge waste of money. I even bought it on Xbox's 50% deal and I still feel robbed. I don't even think my 8 and 6 year old will enjoy playing it. Frown. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not worth it, the load time sucks... PSP is a powerful device but they made it look like a sucky machine due to the slow loading time, no justice at all. And walking around the town that slow? Come on, Nintendo (R) 1st generation games are much faster than that. I ended up giving away my UMD game and the person that got it is happy to have the game, but not with the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

good job you destroyed kinect dont detecting movements crappy meniu shameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee on yooooooooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Serious lack of control makes this game terribly disappointing. There is no explanation for the icons in your log-book; good luck guessing. There is no camera control; you'll just have to learn which way the camera is going to flip when you walk into a certain spot. Your log book tracks how many of each item you sell, but, since you only sell what you buy,  it isn't pertinent to what is actually popular. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with unsellable material that you have no idea what to do with. Some of these things named towns-people will buy (if you happen to have them on display when they happen to stop by). Some of them trigger story events when you display them (if the proper character happens to be activated for that story event when you display the item). The only thing you can do is spend all your game time cycling through the clutter hoping something will trigger something. 99% of your customers wont buy any of these clutter items, they actually get angry and leave because of your lack of variety of real sell-able items. Some of your towns-people will request things, making it easier to figure out what to do with certain items. Unfortunately there is no quest tracking what-so-ever, so get ready to spend lots of time with a pen and paper writing it all down yourself. The soundtrack it terrible. There is one track for each area and it never changes. The shop music is particularly irritating, and you will spend most of your time listening to it. You can turn the music off, but only if you are OK playing the game with no sound at all. You cannot view your inventory outside of your shop, so when you are out buying things to sell, you will need to remember what you already have to avoid buying to many of the same type of item. The entire game could have been saved with simple quest tracking, and a menu system. Also the use of actual words rather than arbitrary icons would be a plus. As an example, I've figured out two of the icons (i think) the little ghost with a tail means girl, and the little ghost without a tail means boy. All together this is just an overpriced flash game poorly ported to 3DS. However, if you would liked the game Mist, or some other mystery game with no guidance and lots of guess and check mechanics, you might enjoy slogging through this disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is what hell looks like. Poorly drawn characters, that a seven year old could have done. Terrible, ear destroying 'music' that loops forever. Boring as hell characters that show none of the usual interesting quirks you get from a Harvest Moon or Rune Factory game. This is literally, one of the only games I have ever played that was completely deserving of a two out of ten rating. When the whole games purpose is done as a usual side feature in most other games, you best build a lot of extras around it. Disgusting. I'd rather play the 3DS port of Duck Dynasty. The game could have only been worse, by being completely broken. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The art in this game are great, and all of the hoopla and interviews on the cool gamer-web sites made this out to be a GTA killer. More like a bad wanna-be. Yeah, I got the free movies and tunes, but the gameplay is *#%@%!! Who designed that targeting system? Obviously someone who hasn't played anything current.. Didn't these guys also make that turd Fight Club? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was horrid...For the most part i was looking at the wall next to the guy that i was trying to kill, while their dead-on aim was tearing me apart...this game made me feel like an idiot because i thought that the awful controls were just me playing sloppily...but alas i was not the only one to experience the terrible gameplay... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is poor. Muddy, fuzzy textures and unresponsive controls can be forgiven, but on rails gameplay and finding the blue switch to open the (you guessed it) blue door is an archaic game mechanic. Its like half life and Goldeneye never happened (never mind Deus Ex or MOH). I thought this game was awful and I'm a huge 40k fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the reviews say is sad but true -- this game is buggy, and just plain unpolished. It doesn't have the fun of the first one, nor the skirmish mode of the second one. It's also unbalanced -- for example, a single wolf can kill several soldiers. So it's hard to recommend it at this time, maybe in the future when it's heavily patched. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really dissapointing sequel. Is it even a sequel. Nothing seems to have changed. Maybe the graphics are a little better. Bland picturecard story telling. Poor line of sight mechanics. Poor troop control. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish all of the other reviews were incorrect. I love the stronghold series and I ALWAYS give a game a good opportunity to impress me before I make a decision. This game just couldn't wait though. As one who loved stronghold 2, I felt empty playing SH3. Gone is my beloved skirmish mode. Even sandbox mode was lacking the ability to build an awesome castle. Maps are microscopic in comparison to SH2 maps. I haven't tried the war campaign but so far the economic campaign has failed to excite. Sure the first two missions were fine but number 3 is a case study in why strategy titles like this need a speed up mode. I'm sorry, I am in fact one of those people who likes to sit back and watch my people go about their business. I love Settlers; Heritage of Kings for that very reason. But it is ridiculous expecting players not to lose patience waiting for wood cutters to level a forest, just to continue. Every facet of this game that I have experienced so far has left me wanting. Imagine, if you can that feeling of getting the Sims 3 after playing Sims 2 with all of the expansion packs and gigs of downloaded custom content. Then add bugs and remove a number of options and things to do from Sims 2 original, multiply it by ten... and the feeling left by SH 3 is still worse. Especially because in the back of my mind is that it is not as if much of what I want will come out in an expansion pack. Large maps, skirmish mode, building variety. I doubt any of this will be added.I truly wish that I could tell people to try it and see for themselves but accept this warning from someone whom is sorely disappointed with the amount of money spent and the result I got. I am very sorry for all of those anticipating something great, but this game is just not worth it. I really wish I had something better to say but this metacritic account was made just to add to the many reviews all saying the same thing: Don't waste your money. It is an empty game that will leave you feeling empty. The tragedy is two fold. It is a poor game, and we are still left wanting stronghold 3 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've come online to get this review in early in the hope that I can save other Stronghold fans from making the same mistake I did. This game is an unfinished, buggy mess and I wish I could get my money back. Pre-ordering games just doesn't pay nowadays as developers seem determined to release their unfinished, unpolished, half-implemented rubbish on the paying public. They've had to make this game on a shoestring budget, and it shows from the beginning with the bugs and the use of black and white drawings in place of cinematics. Mission design is poor, the maps are tiny, the animations are rudimentary and the graphics engine is glitchy.The game simply isn't worth playing in it's current state, and it's merely a throwback to Stronghold 2 and not the original and best Stronghold 1. You have to be worried when a castle building game doesn't give your troops any defensive bonus at all for being behind walls - none whatsoever. Many aspects of the gameplay are quite simply broken, and there is no skirmish mode, just a horrible lackluster campaign. The dreadful reviews will start pouring in soon - hold off on that purchase, wait till you find it in the bargain bin, which won't be very long. A sad waste of time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Remember when stronghold 2 came out? It's more buggy then that ever was.. Graphic errors, no skirmish mode, terrible campaign and lots more to list.. Don't buy this until it's on a 5$ sale or 3 years from now when they fix all the glitches.. Why can't they just remake stronghold 1 or crusader to how we all want it to be.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A nasty surprise for Stronghold fans. This game is very buggy and has an unfinished feel to it. Let me rephrase that: This game has been released in a state it shouldn't be. It's like a fetus gets pulled out of a womb months before its time. This should have never been released in this state.Furthermore, there is a lack of skirmish mode, which means you have to deal with the current campaigns as they are. They are impossibly difficult, not as much to say the game is challenging, but you have the feeling you're not fighting the virtual enemies, rather the bugs you come across. There is no bonus for standing on walls, and your men at arms get stuck when they can't hit their enemies. What is that all about?A lot of people say they don't like the graphics, but I think they're the only pro to this game as far as I'm concerned. I think this game is salvageable with a lot of patching, but for now I'd suggest you all wait till it's in the bargain bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No skirmish mode. No kingmaker.No AI (i.e. computer opponents to play against in any mode, save for what's scripted in the campaign).Multiplayer is broken. You literally cannot play multiplayer. Even if you could, there are four very small maps from which to choose.Limited free build mode comprising two maps, both of which are very tiny. To give you some reference, if you took thirty wheat farms and lined them up, the first and last would be at the edges of the map.I won't comment as to how I like the graphics, because to an extent it is personal preference, but I will tell you there are numerous graphical errors, and castle walls use low resolution, blotchy textures.I do enjoy the audio. Music is nice. It's not enough to overcome the game's other faults by a longshot, however.The game is very buggy. Some people cannot start the game. Others it crashes for, and still others for some odd reason can only play the game in a foreign language (really). For those of us lucky not to experience these major issues, there still is a whole slew of pesky annoyances and gameplay imbalances with which to contend, to the extent that we're wondering if 7sixty and Firefly Studios accidentally released an early beta version instead of the completed game.There are some remedies to Stronghold 2's mechanics that are positive, such as not having to deal with sanitation or criminals, and a better camera UI.Your building choices are also more refined, which does mean less indeed, but I think it's for the better. For instance, there's only a church, and no chapel or cathedral. The church has a support structure, the chandler, a producer of candles, which the church requires to perform services.The honour system is interesting, I think, but there's no sense in going into it here.Housing is nifty in that it changes size and capacity based on distance from the keep.Weather and day and night cycles are kind of glitched, but in theory they are pretty cool.The game is in major need of some serious patches.Even with patches, you'd very likely never see a skirmish mode, as AI is something that takes a very long time to develop, and typically requires coding in the early stages of development.There may be a technical reason the maps are as small as they are. If this is true, it's extremely disappointing.The short answer is stay away from Stronghold 3.Maybe reconsider if it goes on sale for ten bucks, but only after extensive patching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't do it.I am a rare partial-blind gamer, Unfamiliar with this series.  bought this on steam pre-order, and I concur with the rest of the abysmal reviews.  Played this for about an hour before turning it off in frustration.  The most striking elements are near non-existent KB controls (important to some folks), lackluster storyline (the opening anyway), small / poorly designed maps, and its just TOO similar to SH 1.  All the typical ailments of a low-budget game.  No skirmish mode. The Settlers series is similar to this and those beat this with a stick.  These type of games fail to keep my interest.  I was expecting something like Sim-Medieval Kingdom, but its like Castle-Craft gone bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stronghold 3 can be described as full of bugs, stupid developer decisions, and it AI (if it can be called like that at all) robs you blind. There are problems everywhere, archers who can't shoot from towers, when attacking you will need lot of patience to find a place around enemy where cursor changed to attack icon, sometimes you have to click on enemy and most of times you have to hunt pixel around enemy where it will let you to attack. As for robbing AI, if you have 8 spearmen and you attack 1 enemy spearman, he will kill 5 of yours before falls. Also wolves, at campaign start you can't build walls, wolfs enter settlement they will kill all peasants, farmers, woodcutters, as they cant defend for themselves. You will need to run around with lord hunting wolves around town to keep as much people alive as you can, also one wolf can kill 3-4 spearmen. Game can be unstable, so you will need to save a lot, as there is no auto-save. List of problems goes on and on. And all of this is just about campaign, as there is no skirmish, no kingmaker mode. There is no AI, game just spawns units that are same as yours but AI archers do more damage than players, same goes for men at arms, spearmen, etc. Total garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After being a huge fan of the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader, I am sad to say that this release is absurdly bad.  I am not sure that I have seen a major commercial PC release this bad in my 20+ years of gaming.

This wouldn't have been a brilliant game if it had come out five years ago, let alone now. Looks dated and dodgy, plays very poorly with slow, unresponsive units and a primitive interface. Even though it's a niche game and offers the reasonably rare selling point of letting you build and run a castle it does it so badly that even if I was jonesing for a castle building game I'd still give it a miss. Really disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No working multiplayer, single player, map, wall, AI, saved games... No single map. Nothing works properly with 50dollars price tag.ashes of a legend 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is just plain bad. they make you pay 50 bucks for a game that feels like it was made 10 years ago. I used to like stronghold now i just want to forget it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As the first time I've played a game in this series, I was very much looking forward to trying a game that was heavily hyped.

I can see why people love the premise and style of the game however it severely lacks polish and, if I were to guess, I'd suggest it shipped a couple of months before it was ready.

The tutorial, something very important to a new player, was superficial at best.  It gives no indication on how to play except on how to place a couple of the basic buildings.  Very poor.

The game has several inconvenient bugs, has a very claustrophobic map size which I expect will inhibit grand building later in the game, only ships with a few multiplayer maps and is missing some fairly obvious gameplay modes.

If you have any doubt it was rushed, ask anyone who pre-ordered and found out that the game did not even have English-language (both spoken and menus) complete and needed to wait 24 hours for this to be patched in.

Perhaps much of this will be resolved by patches after release however this does not excuse shipping a half-complete product.  I don't expect to pay to beta test a product.

It's left a bad taste in my mouth and I'm somewhat frustrated that I cannot return the game via Steam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't buy this unfinished, buggy game actual...There is no skirmish mode, no ai support for MP - not even a working MP.Your peasants eat 3x food as normal - and your maps are tiny - so you will build food buildins only - no space for a castle.You cannot build wall on wall and your walls become broken by food units...This is just a part of negative things on the current Stronghold 3 release. But the badest things are response like this:"Stronghold 3 was designed as a throwback to the original Stronghold. Itâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some bugs ive noticed after the TENTH{yes 10th}patch.
Knights on invisible horses.
Units that walk thru walls
AI that is beyond horrible
Units commands are broken
Multiplayer is still for the most part unplayable.
These are a few of the bugs i witnessed in 15 mins of gameplay
Worst release ive seen in 10 years easily.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS TITLE.........
BUYER BEWARE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Milking of the money teat at its very worst.  This game is nothing more than a transparent attempt to bilk money from Stronghold fans by selling the title and not the game.  In fact, I'm not sure there is much of a game.  Horribly unbalanced, buggy, and ridiculously boring, the campaign is closer to a CIA interrogation than entertainment.  Avoid this at all costs - oh, and in my opinion, avoid anything from SouthPeak if this is the kind of drek they foist on people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's going to take a lot of work to get this game into a state that it is playable. Wolves can climb ladders, troops don't respond to mouse clicks, walls don't offer any protection to your troops, it's a complete mess.

All this said I don't think that its terminal, it can be fixed, with extensive patching, I think. What is particularly worrying however is the response from Firefly which appears to be, keep mouth shut and lock the forum posts of people who complain, in anyway. Doesn't sound like a dev team who are likely to fix the game with a patch?

Second time I've been caught out pre-ordering a game in the space of a month, note to self...... "no reviews = bad game" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG so many bugs needs lots of patching, dang and I just got crushed by how bad RAGE was then I start this unfinished "steamer" thinking to myself I was in for a long and wonderful night of building my castle and crushing my enemies not worth $50. UGH I'm just going to wait for the patches and hope they finish the game and maybe i'll come back and raise the score but a 2 is the best I can give for now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is so typical for a game tie-in to come out along with the movie. Since this is a movie-licensee game I should have known that it was built for nothing more than mediocrity. However due to the Spider man games being able to expand on the films, I was willing to give this game a chance. Unfortunately Iron Man fails to break that curse. The first level was deceptively fun when you pay as Tony Stark when he wears the Mark I and Black Sabbath's "Iron Man" being played. Unfortunately though it starts to go all down hill when he starts to wear the Mark II and later flies across the sky. The flight controls feel pretty slippery for lack of a better word and the weapons systems lack any kind of punch. They are good at destroying waves of enemies with less-than steller A.I. The infantry are really nothing more than cannon fodder so the majority of enemies that can  harm you are tanks and other vehicles. After you deal a certain amount of damage you can defeat them with a quick time event. These events are pretty tedious to pull off though but they are necessary in order to regain health. The way the game handles health is a valid attempt to input some innovation but by using a quick time event to start up Iron Man's heart but it also tedious. The boss fights barely count as fights since all that is required is to do the dame strategy until their health bar is depleted. In fact the final fight against Iron Monger is actually easier than the fight against Witney Frost which is really just a fight against three turrets. To add insult to injury there is a segment involving the master controller who tries to mess with your mind and breaks the fourth wall in a shallow attempt to replicate the boss fight against Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid. On top of that this game is ugly with textures that are outdated even by the standards of the Wii and the PS2 and it is combined with phoned in voice acting. I would say that people should avoid it but than again it would imply that someone actually bought it in the first place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In short: Terrible storyline and narration, voice actors that make you want to put the game on mute, graphics that lack any distinguishable quality, horrible gameplay. This game could've looked average on the PS2, but is by far the worst game that has ever had the pleasure of entering my PS3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not just bad, but bad on multiple fronts.

I'm a baseball fan, and based on the reviews here, I didn't expect a great, or even a good game. But I was surprised by a failure on so many levels: design, programming, and artistic. No offense to any of the people who probably worked quite hard to make this with little time and little budget, but at some point you have to look at the result and go, why bother? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh. Just awful. If you only look at Steam, you might get the idea that this game is the second coming of System Shock 2; nothing could be further from the truth. Abysmal AI, horrible level design, lots of bugs (at least one of which stops the game dead in its tracks), goofy monologues from characters that make no sense half the time, and generally primitive gameplay which pretty much ignores all the great features other developers have come up with over the last decade or more (this game plays like it was made in the 90s, and not in a good way.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just rubbish. The game is based on trial and error, you'll die with no indication, so you got to sit through the fmv sequences all over again, and theres no way to skip them. ARRGGHH. The camera is very twitchy, therefore control of your character is awful. Just Rubbish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

cheap is one word that could summarize this game. The graphics are horrendous. This is the only game that I could fully beat in 30 minutes. For crying out loud, you do not even do anything a real taxi even does. there are plenty of better Gamecube racing games out there 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's not a game, it's a Pokemon screen saver... and not a very interesting one. Even the most diehard young Pokemon fanatic will tire of this within half an hour. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its like Painkiller, but you only have 2 guns at any time. That kind of just made me stop playing after 10 minutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very boring, goes on and on, nothing fun, nothing good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what a... poor game... it is a really good concept, pretty bad developed, teh game is based on killing hordes of monsters and killing hordes of monsters and killing hordes of monsters and... killign hordes of monsters... whichmakes teh game very repetitive, you get bored after the first horde you killed, i played teh game in a free trial, and after the first lv i noticed teh game wasn't going to get any better... it "sucked" though it had an awesome sound, good graphics, and a nice story 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When i saw this on the shelves i thought "this looks like its gonna be a good game", i have 2 sons, my eldest is 14 and my youngest is 10, we all played this game and thoght it was pants. The gaming engine within the ps3 should excite the producers of the games that are comming out for this platform but it seems that they have only gone half way with this one. When are they going to realise that the concept of "press a button to open the door then kill some badies then press a button to open the door then kill some badies etc etc is not what we want any more. Graphicly it looked reasonable but the charactor movements were inconsistent and sometimes were very annoying. I know a lot of work goes into making games but to be honest its not just about the work that goes into making these things its about the thought that goes into the story behind the game. When your paying top prices for games you expect a little bit more than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ignore Bob B. The Corporate Marketing Goon below. The only thing "accurate" about this game is the information about the cars and track... the gameplay has little basis in reality. The only thing "challenging" is trying to keep your lunch down due to severe nausea resulting from profound regret over wasting your money.  Finally, the only thing "fun" here is laughing at the absolutely pathetic visuals... racing games on the N64 looked better than this. Avoid this game at all costs, even if you are a die-hard racing fan. Instead, save your money for Mario Kart. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The lack of effort put into this game is near mind-blowing. I cannot believe they put their name on it. There's a reason gamemarket has it listed as 39.50 and its a brand new game.  Redundant. Boring. The Scenery and Gameplay are atrocious. The story-line is sloppy and uninteresting. I couldnt bring myself to play it for more than 20 minutes. Do not waste your money on this epic failure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me start off by saying I only played the first level of this game. It was so bad, I couldn't justify playing any further. Let me save you time and money by telling you the game looks horrible! The controls are way too loose and the story is a dime a dozen. Save yourself some time and just punch yourself in the face as it will have the same result as playing this game... a headache! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll keep this brief, because I can some up the whole game with one instance. There was a massive amount of enemies in a room I had to clear out, and my NPC allies couldn't hit anything in the room, but for some reason, I took all of the fire. Died about 100 times trying to clear the room, whilst my allies yelled at me for having bad aim, and when I did finally clear the room, without my allies getting a single kill, I heard something like,"You don't have to do this all by yourself, you know?" There is NO middle finger big enough!! To hell with this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To be honest, I did have fun with this game because I was just a child back then. Now that I'm older, I have pretty much lost my rose-coloured glasses. Repetitive is the word to describe this. Enemies lack in variety, and so do locations (like about 3). Sure it's Pearl Harbour and there's not many places to go, but the game doesn't really have to be all centered around Pearl Harbour. Even back in 2001, this game is hard to recommend and it's still hard to recommend because there are similar games like this on the web or on Android or iPhone which are even more fun and for free. Don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really did not care for this game after my level was reset.  I was really hopefull too after hearing about it because i liked gears of war so much.  But this just feels wrong, its like they took Gears and swapped pallets but hired a highschooler to do it.  Im just dissapointed is all 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With the olympics just gone, Beijing did a wonderful job of recreating the track and field game. this though, is a half-arsed attempt to milk it. some of the events such as the 100/200m are straight forward (how can they not be). but others such as swimming, the jumping events are extremely poorly implemented and irritating. also lack of live features and such others show that its a rushed game and not worthy of being released, titles like this should be pulled of the shelves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Completely disappointing, by all means. Most people would enjoy it for the fact that it carries the nostalgia of both Sonic and the ill-fated remains of the Dreamcast library. The major problem is that the game has aged well by no means. I played the game on the original Dreamcast way back in 2000, and had beaten it in full, and I replayed it again years later in its DX iteration. The game itself cannot seem to be enjoyable by today's standards. Every character's controls are really bad, especially if you're among the slower ones, and the camera and voice acting are just as repulsive as they were a decade ago. The major, glaring problem though is the price points. The original Dreamcast version may not be available to buy outside of online auction and some shops, but it can also be easily pirated if you're into that. The Gamecube "DX" remake is still available at some Gamestops for 12 dollars, 2 more than the current release. Not only that, but the rereleases now require you to pay ANOTHER 5 dollars for a "DX" upgrade, which only allows you to play as Metal Sonic and unlock a few more emblems to get, yet you still cannot unlock the Game Gear games or link up with GBA, which were both available options in the DX version. Overall, if you really want to play this game, look for older versions, and pass up this pointless waste immediately. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Greetings sports fans the season is upon us and unfortunately the grass may be "greener on the otherside." For all of you diamond lovers who are tethered to the Xbox console prepare yourself for a let down.  Not only is this years MLB 2k baseball game a simple rehash of last years the failing company even went as far as to all out pull the most popular feature...its online league play.  Now as  a die hard MLB 2k supporter every year I defend my beloved franchise against all the haters and PS3 rabble rousers that claim that MLB The show is better.  Time and time again I continue to point out the obvious reasons for my continued patronage...but alas 2k you have crossed the line.  Limiting players to meaningless ranked matches is a sure fire way to ruin what's left of your already failing reputation.  In closing the game plays well enough with only minor cosmetic glitches but is no where near the 60 usd price tag that the game retailed at.  Also due to a lack of online leagues the game is actually LESS than the previous years iteration.  Buyer beware... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't really point out the game's flaws better than many others have here so I'll just leave you with this: It's as if 2K has forgotten that you're supposed to offer something better than before, even if only slightly, with a "new" product. Sure, EA Sports have their ups and downs all the time but MLB2K has been trending downward for the last half decade. For the last 5 years, MLB2K has gotten progressively WORSE. Although it's the only MLB license on the Xbox, perhaps it's time for MLB Properties to pull the license away from 2K. It's clear 2K no longer cares. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It gets 2 because whilst it's not the worst game in the world there is but little to redeem it. The fighting system is poor, (thats the main part of the game) and organizing your cards is tedious and relatively unintuitive (another core of the game). It is cool seeing all the the Capcom and SNK characters in card form, (phoenix wright characters make pleasant additions) but seeing familiar faces does not warrant any of your gaming time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One by one review. The Graphic is good enough to please your eyes. The Story is somewhat fair. The AI is deadly terrible, both friends and foes, you can HARDLY heal (and antivirus-ing) your AI teammates (They will move around away from you), The Control is good EXCEPT for the "throwing body to the ground" action  (which annoyingly put you down when you're running to get herbs) & the "auto wall-cover", which is ridiculously stick you to a wall when you get near, and SLOWING you (while you're trying to get out of firing line strafing, most often case).The Weapon option is quite broad. The Character active skills are disturbing (You can get three, but only one may be brought to the battle). The Bugs & Glitches are almost in every corner of the map, very bad game polishing before release. Overall: Bad, or Worse (Considering this a long way out-of-RE usual standard) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst Resident Evil game EVER !!!
CAPCOM badly hurt RE serial with this one :/
One of the worst games i have played for a long time

Do not buy this crap !!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Capcom have let themselves down in a big way. The game looked extremely rushed and badly made in every way. The sound bug on the PC is the worse I've seen in ages since Tom Clancy's Vegas 2.

You start the first level and half way through the sound stops, but you can't restart the game because you have to restart the level.

Get Resident Evil 6 and avoid this bad attempt at a MP game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bugs? OMG TOO MUCH BUGS!  A.I? Not so good I see. Graphics? Up to date. Gameplay? Very bad. Story? You ruined it Capcom you really did. Overall: Bad don't even think about making a new game in the RE series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whether or not a game is $10 or inexpensive should not justify a boring experience. If this was free, it would still be just as tedious and lacking in scares or a reason to continue. Outlast may have had its own problems, but overall is a much, much better game and more worthy of your money. I went back to view a video of one of Daylight's producers talking about how great this was going to be before it was released. He deserves an Oscar (or jail sentence) for his completely devoid of truth performance. PS - I wish I had my 10 bucks back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

terrible just like the street fighter until the graph and beautiful but not this complete set of harmony and free game demo and eai not have to pay all that **** and that nintendo 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. Most flash games gave me a better experience than this. I hate the controls. The stick on the new 3ds is so bad for aiming. If they had used something like the Uprising controls maybe I could actually aim at the enemies. The voice acting is horrendous. Is it really that hard to put a little bit of emotion in your lines? You're actually trying to sell this game right? The only reason why I'm not giving it a 0 is because the worlds do look somewhat decent. Unfortunately for this game I value gameplay over graphics. It's also very repetitive becoming boring at parts. Trust me. The demo will give you more fun than the entire game ever would. I'm just glad I played it on a friends system so I didn't spend a penny. You'll most likely have to actually pay for this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man, this game ios absolute garbage, I rented it because I heard it was an easy 1000 gamerscore, which it is, but the time you spent playing will make you want to vomit, I can only say the same about a few other games, those are Phantasy Star Universe and King Kong. Still worth a rent if your a G-Score type person. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nintendogs is a better dog sim than Dogz, but owning a real dog is better than both. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is clunky and generic. I know this is for kids but any kid can pick this up and finish it quickly. And this game took no time since it has bad graphics and bad gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Después de un par de juegos excelentes aparece esta bazofia mal programada, aburrida, censurada, con pocos coches que escoger, IA inexistente, realmente una perdida de tiempo 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Digimon World 4 is a bad hack and slash game, bad levels designs, with overpower bosses and bad story, this is one of the worst digimon game, and one of the worst game I've played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A horrendously bad game. I haven't played any other Digimon World games, but I don't think I want to. There is a lot of information needed to be known by the player in terms of stats, equipment, spells, etc. However, the game does an atrocious job of teaching it to you. Learning the rules of the game is optional and forces you to talk to rooms filled of tutorial-elves. Combat is ridiculous. Your character swings your sword with the same animation over and over, causing sword-fighting to look goofy and ineffective. Level structure is abominable. There are no save points, meaning every time you die you have restart from the main hub. This presents forced back-tracking, making traversing through the world repetitive. If the game was easy, this wouldn't be such a big problem. The enemies take a massive amount of hits, barely drop health-restoring items, are more agile than you, and respawn constantly. The game is designed to be played with four people, but more often than not you'll be playing alone or with one other person. One could rationalize that you can buy healing items, but they are ridiculously overpriced. Not only that, but whenever you die you loose all of your money. You can revive your past-self to regain your money, but reviving requires an item that is rarely dropped by enemies. Digimon World 4 is a giant mess of missed-direction, confusion, and frustration. The story is non-existent, the gameplay is shallow and poorly executed, the mechanics are unexplained and confusing. It could possibly be the worst game I've ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing. It's basically 'connect-the-dots', that's about it. You don't connect the dots to the beat of the music, you just connect them while the music's playing. Maybe the mini-games have some redeming qualities, I'm not sure, I couldn't handle much more than about 5 minutes of this game, it's that bad. Avoid this one! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe I wasted my money on this. Unfortunately for me, it was an impulse buy at a store and I can't believe that I just spent $50 on it. All the reviews are right: this game COULD have been fun, but it's NOT. I don't care about pretty graphics or licenses (I just have a standard TV), but what graphics they had in the game were awful. The gameplay is also really bland. What's the point of the melee weapons AT ALL? it's better to be tank for the whole game. The leveling minigame is also really bad. If you lose, it takes away points from your stats! Horrible. Stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As nintendo world report put it: FlingSmash is full of interesting gameplay ideas that would've been a lot more fun if the game controlled well, or at the very least, compensated for the poor controls by being a little more forgiving.

The game is mediocre and not worth your time. Artoon is horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game promised so much, and then completely fell on it's face. The graphics are very good, but nothing like was promised by the "demo" videos show prior to release. In game they were par for FPS, and it seem great detail was paid to recreate the atmosphere and tension of the movies. The first levels on the Sulaco weren't too bad story wise, but the game was already showing it's weaknesses. The NPC AI is broken beyond repair, and the Alien AI is nonexistent. Duck Hunt was more challenging. By the end of the Sulaco levels, the story was quickly devolving into idiocy. The story makes no sense what so ever and is a slap in the face to fans of the movies. And my biggest complaint is the lack of immersion. They went to all of the trouble to model the dropship and the APC, yet they are only set dressing. The only time the player gets to ride in these vehicles is in cut scenes, never mind flying/driving them. It is because of this game that I will never buy another title from GearBox for full price, and will share their future games used with all of my friends. Shame on them for stealing from consumers, as this game is a complete ripoff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

don't know how they could screw up any more than they did.

terrible AI, terrible graphics, mediocre multiplayer, mediocre story, and they have the nerve to sell DLC.
gearbox shouldn't be allowed to make games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's wrong with this game:
1- Ridiculous story line that messes up the film story and makes no sense, and offers no explanation, with a terrible cut and dry ending. It's cannon by the way. 2-  Terrible alien AI that is not scary, but ridiculous, with hilarious glitches. 3- Glitchy graphics with muddy textures, esp. on consoles 4- Fighting humans for at least 50% of the game!? its called ALIENS! 5- Friendly AI characters: O'Neil, you are a useless  and fundamentally unlikable. 6- The E3 2011 demo was the biggest lie in gaming 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stay away from Aliens even if you are a fan of the franchise. I made the mistake thinking it'd be fun but the game is terrible. The campaign is just 5 hrs of mindless shooting, cutscenes look like they were made on last gen consoles, your AI team mates never shut the hell up and are uninteresting and the ending was awful. Co-op makes the experience even worse as you are constantly shoving your friends into walls because nearly 75% of the game will take place in incredibly tight corridors. Multiplayer is also a bummer as playing as the xenomorphs is clunky and awful and the online community will probably be dead in a couple of months or less. What you see in the trailers and vidocs is not what is in the game. It is a lie as the game was outsourced to developer TimeGate and Gearbox only worked on portions of the multiplayer. This is arguably one of the worst games I have ever played and no one should suffer through this excuse of a game. Save your $60 or just play the AVP videogame that came out a couple years ago. Yes, even that game is better the Colonial Marines 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for Aliens: Colonial Marines, but like most people who played this game, I am deeply disappointed. The story is so bare bones it does not even matter if it is cannon or not. The graphics have a numerous amount of problems like screen tearing, slow down, and low resolution textures. I also experience a lot of glitches will playing, sometimes it would shut the whole game down. The fellow marines that are controlled by the AI are terrible and tend to get in the way a lot. The enemy AI is not any better. Xenomorphs do not act like their counterpart in the films, running right in front of you waiting to be shot. The 3 boss fights are also a walk in the park, giving the player no challenge. The gunplay is alright, the weapons blend well into the universe, and the shooting is not half bad. The co-op campaign is useless as another player is unnecessary and does not add to the experience. The multiplayer has one good mode that is worth playing. The Escape mode is similar to Left 4 Dead but with enemy controlled aliens. The other multiplayer modes feel unbalanced and there is only 4 maps for each mode. Aliens: Colonial Marines might have a few easter eggs for die hard Aliens fans, but besides that I would avoid this game, especially if you are a fan of the franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's phenomenal, if you're the type of loony who licks windows for a living. More than angry, the game just makes me sad. It could, should and probably would have been good if it had been released a few years ago; unbroken. I was going to round this off with something positive to say about the game, but there's just nothing. Sorry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a fail, no matter what anyone says. The graphics cant run right on my Xbox, and start to look pretty junky after the first hour. Enemy and partner A.I are horrible, and O'neal did not kill one alien my whole play through. Multiplayer is glitchy and the marines are very overpowered against their alien enemies. There is no survival, which is a shame. And included to all of that, the game is just plain ol' unfinished. Literally, my gun disappeared at moments, O'neal walked through walls, and the power loader sequences are literally UNPLAYABLE. Even the lore is horrible. It does continue off of the movie ALIENS, but ignores Alien 3 and 4. By now, I've had it with this game. The reason I have not given it a 0 was because of the easter eggs, but thats it. Game over, man. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is god awful. it destroys my mind on why my dad bought this piece of dog  the a.i is weird and  and the game play is just depressing. Don't buy this, save your money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My expectations were incredibly high, unfortunately after six long years of waiting through delay after delay, I get slapped in the face with a half assed story, Uninteresting characters, PS2 quality graphics, crappy textures and idiotic AI. Please for the love of all that's good, don't buy this game!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DON'T PLAY THIS GAME, IT IS ONE OF THE WORST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED, GRAPHICS= **** AI= **** STORY=****. THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME. THE ONLY OK THING I CAN SAY ABOUT IT IS THAT I DIDN'T HATE THE FIRST MISSION.
2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aliens: Colonial Marines is a TURRIBLE game which only place it deserves in your game collection is a drink coaster. I should have known not to trust Gearbox after the unfinished disaster: Duke Nukem Forever. The gameplay demos for this piece of sh@# are plain lies, tricking you into buying this unfinished sh@#tty piece of s@# . The AI is as smart as a grain of salt, the gameplay is mind-numbingly boring, and a rock could write a better story. *sighs*. If you want a good Alien game, buy Alien Isolation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

finished the single player mode yesterday. Game is very short (5 hours wtf!?), has really bad graphics and the gameplay feels like in low budget pc fps game. There is no horror atmosphere in this game bacause it was made as 4 player co op game (something like Dead Island but much much worse!). Multiplayer sucks, finding players takes you 1,5 minute and the lag kills the fun. No dedicated servers. Just simple p2p matchmaking like in CoD but created worse. There are multiplayer modes where you can play as alien versus humans. To tell you the truth, nobody wants to play as aliens because marines are way to powerfull. If marine players stick together, they always wins the match. The only option to win the multiplayer match as an aliens is when it is match where aliens have bigger numbers than marines (ex. 2 marines vs  6 aliens). In multiplayer match  6 vs 6  marines ALWAYS win. You can't choose sides, game does it for you like the developers knew that nobody would like to be alien.

Oh! And one more funny thing! This game WAS NOT CREATED by Gearbox but 5 different developers. You can see their names in the campaign intro. Gearbox was supporting them with their brand. F*ck you SEGA and gearbox. Lost respect for those companies.

For a game that was seven years in the making, it is terrible! I made an account just to warn people to stay away from this title. The positive reviews are either being paid off by gearbox and saga or are people that are in complete denial after paying $60 for a frisbee. The graphics are out of date, the multiplayer is broken, and the entire game takes place in a revolving square map that slightly changes scenery. Even if you're an aliens fan, please wait for it to go on sale pre-owned and save yourself the headache. This game is so bad the GameStop near me is allowing opened returns to their loyal customers who they suggested the game to. I give it a 2, only because it has co-op. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately pre ordered the game. Avoid Avoid Avoid! If you want to buy this just watch a walkthrough and it will dispel the hype and your hopes. Developers, please ban the word "Hoorah" from all videogames effective immediately.
One chapter in Colonic Latrines is actually called "Hoorah to Ashes" Really?!  No wonder the  writer of the game story Mike Neumann took a cruise after this, hopefully there's a free bar. They left out things so you have to buy horde mode in DLC adding your losses to $75. Sorry Gearbox you know that's the main thing people loved (rebellions AVP) and you left it out. Dirty. Cash grab attempt to cover the money they know they're gonna lose on this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wonder how much SEGA paid EGM to rate this awful game a 90. Anyway this game is really bad. Screen tear is noticeable and the graphics is bad. If you're an Alien/s fan probably get this on PC with all the mods, which I guess wouldn't save this unfinished mess 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, apparently it takes years of delays and disappointment before you can release a truly awful game.  Aliens: Colonial Marines is exhibit A.  This comes from a big Aliens fan who has waited and waited for this title to be released.
The graphics and textures make you think you're playing on the original Xbox, the story for the woefully short game is also dire (yes, a game with less than 6 hours of gameplay), no tension in the game and the motion tracker is a waste of time.
Looks like Sega replaced their 'QA' dept with a 'Do we look bothered about the product' department.
Don't get me started with the strange option to put a supressor onto your pulse rifle, only to find that you can't take it back off).  Leave this load of rubbish well alone and keep your hard earned cash in your pocket. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be one of the worst first person shooters I've ever played on the Xbox. I'm really disappointed because I love the Alien franchise and I've been looking forward to this game for months. Firstly, everything feels very outdated... it's an extremely basic first person shooter with graphics that belong on the PS2. The checkpoint system is just a mess; the last thing I want to do is have the same firefight over and over again just because a checkpoint didn't activate after I'd pressed three or so switches (perhaps acceptable on lower difficulties, but if you like a challenge this is a nightmare). Which brings me to my next point: switches! The entire game is simply going through corridor after corridor, activating switches and cutting through broken doors. It's nothing like the horror-survival/FPS hybrid I expected. There are no jump-out-of-your seat moments, despite the potential, since y'know... it's a game set in the world of Alien. The characters are all two-dimensional couldn't give a flying sh*t about any of them. What forced my hand to write a bad review was the glitches; if it's not a non-moving elevator, it's an NPC not doing what he's programmed to do, ultimately forcing you to restart from the last checkpoint that was two fights ago, do them again, and hope it works the second time around! (again, a nightmare if you're on a challenging mode). Really, it just feels like you're playing a very rushed, cheap, glitchy movie cash-in. I'm glad I rented it before deciding to buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gearbox pulled the old bait and switch!!!! Game shown was not the game sold....not the first time gearbox has done this http://www.videogamer.com/videos/aliens_colonial_marines_what_the_hell_happened_to_aliens_colonial_marines_2.html 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Arrived in the post yesterday, I heard some bad reviews but as a fan I thought this was exaggeration.  Well I wish I never opened it and got a refund.  The campaign is 5 hours long with an AI that terrible for both your squad and the enemy.  I should be saying Aliens rather then enemy, but half the game you arnt fighting aliens!!!  Thats right, an aliens game and you spend half of it fighting other marines on the Corporation.  The end boss as well... just over one minute to beat...  the games just painful.  I want to give it a good review, I pre-ordered this on nostalgia and the fact that this looked like it was the aliens game that would be it!    Multiplayer is the only thing that can make this game fun and it wears thin fast.  The marines are very overpowered and while you can take out lone wolves, if they stick in a group and are organized playing as an alien is just not fun.  Other players give up quick and it makes it impossible.  Basically if you stay in a group then its an instant win.   High hopes. Crushed by technical problems (screen tear), poor AI, poor graphics with missing textures and retcons.  Dont get me started on who they bring back from the dead!   Oh and those awesome early previews which got everyone excited, guess what not in the game!!    Poor poor show.   I pray the DLC can partially redeem this game especailly as its supposed to be cannon! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor gameplay. Last gen graphics this gen! Terrible, terrible AI in both the NPC's and the Xenomorphs! For an Aliens game, you spend more time fighting humans with guns??????????? No dedicated servers so no over watch. Terrible match making. Just a terrible disappointment. the E3 demo looked amazing. this game looks god aweful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was expecting this game for many years so it comes up with such a great disappointment. The kills don't look realistic, there are motion glitches on the aliens, repetitive game play, terrible multiplayer system. The thing i enjoyed was a big alien startling me and being cautious at the sewers, of course reviving the places of the movie; but after that, its predecessor aliens vs predator, its way much better than this huge mistake that will sink the aliens franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you a fan of the aliens series, like me then leave this well alone. its absolutely no improvement to AVP game in fact its much worse, the engine is pants and generally is just awful. this was a made by people to make money quick, not as a product for people to enjoy. everyone involved has absolutely no shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think its worth a rent, just to have a few laughs at how bad it is. Then after the laughs fade to boredom, you can simply return it. This is a game that should never have seen the light of day; literally, there is no reason for this game to exist. If they released it as an Arcade game, for under $15, I would be willing to give it a 5/10, but as a full priced game, Gearbox is laughing in your face. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first thing you will notice about this game is the amazingly awful graphics, which instantly will take you out of the atmosphere that maybe the main menu provided. Yep, the main menu is probably the only thing even remotely close to atmospheric in this game. If it weren't for the fact that you are actually shooting at aliens from the "Alien"-universe, you probably wouldn't know that this game was inspired by that aforementioned movie series, "inspired" being the keyword. If you love the Alien-universe you would do best to stay away from this game, and don't hold your breath for any future Alien game (that's actually enjoyable to play), it'l only be downhill from here on out folks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Feels like they rushed to get this one out. Little boring to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What pisses me off the most about Lucius 2 is that as it stands is almost the opposite of what was advertised. I don't think that only one or two ways to kill someone, or sometimes only one way qualifies as freedom to kill how you want. While the graphics have been upgraded, almost everything else has taken a huge step back. The powers are worthless, the inventory is too large and the audio issues are frustrating.

Despite it's problems there is still some entertainment in the game, and it will last you four levels which is almost half of the game. The developers seemed to of just stopped caring at the start of part two as it is the most bugged, glitched and limited in freedom for the game. The final level is the nail in the coffin as it is clearly in a pre-beta state. You could make a game yourself about everything that is wrong with Lucius 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total disappointment. Idea to bring this game to Xbox 360 was interesting... but Microsoft, of course, shove us an Avatars and we have to use them. No creation of your own character, bad gameplay, not so great sound effects and most importantly, this is one of the worst Wrestling games since this with Hulk Hogan and those created by LJN for NES and SNES. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fire Pro Wrestling, okay, the game can look really funny, but the ressult is other. What is the ressult? A terrible disaster. The game have some good graphics, the controls are horrible, the gameplay is terrible, and the game have more mistakes. Is terrible, funny in some moments, but is horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is boring, repetitive and the graphics are really awful for a Xbox 360. I think the voice acting its the only good point of it, but still sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted this game to be good. I really did. However, this game goes beyond disappointment. I almost cried. Anyway, I'll start with the good stuff: The voice acting is really good (with anime-like quality), the characters seem to have a lot of personality, and the interface isn't hard to look at. However, the bad outweighs the good so much that the good made its own pit to hell and incinerated any redeeming quality I had of this game. There is almost no interactions with you and the storyline, the boss fights are just scribbling your screen, and the translation is so bad that I beat the game and still don't know what the hell happened. Whatever you do, don't buy this game. You'll end up falling into the pit to hell that it cleverly concealed on top of a nice box art. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Never played a more boring game ever. It cost 60$ WOW thats stealing your money!!! They would be beter off just giving the game when you buy the movie DVD later. I finished the game in 4 hours an those were the most boring hours ever. Every batlle is basicly the same. You dont have to worry about your team because they have a godmode it seems LOL. I seen that angie woman get shot with 60 bullets eh lasers whatever an she just walked away not even bleeding LOL. The only good thing i found in the game was the cover option. WASTE OF MONEY. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DLC packaged as a real game. Much like the watchman game nobody bought off Xbox live this game feels like an unfinished demo. The gameplay feels like a dollar store geras of war and is about as dull as dull can be. Like people have said before, if you want to pad your gamerscore with 1000 points from three hours of work go ahead or spend 3 months getting seriously 2.0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game took about 7 hours to finish and im amazed that i was bothered to last that long. The only real reason for getting this is that the achievements are very easy to get. If your bothered about achievements then rent it, if you not then steer clear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

UPDATE to my old review. Now the game runs a lot smoother. Maybe my console was overheated? I've had it since launch and that has never happened before. Or maybe the update (which I 100 percent downloaded before starting the game) did not get applied properly. I did not "cover the vents" on my Wii U or anything, I'm not retarded, there is plenty of space around it. In any case, the game still has a lower frame rate than PC, and suffers from frame drops. But it is playable in its current state. I would advise getting the PC version if at all possible, or the XBone/PS4 one I suppose.

The game itself is not very impressive. It would never live up to the hype, but to me the biggest shortcoming is the level design, it's just not where it needs to be. A platformer like this lives and dies with the level design. If instead of spending all that time with online mode, voice acting (which still turned out horrible) and God knows what other useless crap, they instead would've focused on level design I think this would've turned out a lot better. This is very much an IntiCreates game, and as per usual the levels rely way too much on "spikes" and various instant death setups. It's half assed, and does not come close to for example the Mega Man ZX-games. I would rate this worse than most Mega Man-games except possibly for X4-X6, but not by much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Generally bad game. I wanted so badly to give it a chance but it was just so terrible. The only thing it had going for it was the way the girls where dressed. It tried to do a system simmilar to the konami guitar game (usually found in arcades), but failed miserably at trying to port a system like that to the PS2. On top of all that, they start you out having to play songs that are way way too difficult for a biginner that has no idea what they're doing (like most players would be at that point). The controls where all whacky and hard to understand, it never explained any of the controls or features like most rpg's do, and the gameplay was very slow and uneventful. Because of the 5 day; day night time system, the only events that happened where at sertain times during the course of the five days, so you['d find yourself wandering around aimlessly waiting for the next event to happen. All in all I was very dissappointed with this game, and I tried several times to give it a chance, but I finally gave up. One of the worst RPG's I've ever played. Maybe even the very worst. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this game, I really did...

It has restrictions on timeframes whereby you have to be at a specific place at a certain time in order to progress, which can be difficult and unappealing after the initial playing wears off. There are constant monotonous battles, you are frequently left scratching your head about what you need to do next, and the load times in between areas on the PS2 can send you to sleep.

The graphics are poor, although I can personally see past those if the plot or gameplay pull me in, for EF they just add to the list of weaknesses.

When the music and mini-games are the only things preventing the game receiving a zero score, you know that its a dud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is just **** up,not the game. Bad graphics, ugly animation, a cliché story, terrible game design, level design,optimization.And you ask really 60$?Are you serious?This game should cost a maximum of$5!Weapons skins took from Warface,gameplay just took from Far cry just made crooked.On this game, did anybody ever tried?2/10 worst game of the year, worst game I played 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad controls, bland graphics, stupid AI, bad loading, stupid respawns, and no fun. stay far away from this game, and just play ratchet and clank as it much more fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When you start skipping the terrible cutscenes from the second one, you just know it's not going to be roses. Ascaron was the first with a pirates theme (way before Sid n Co) but they've managed to take a fun game and make it dull and irritating. Button mashing deluxe. About 15 minutes of marginal entertainment. What a pity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this. I wanted a good motorbike VR game, and the VR mode in moto race 4 ps4 is actually nice enough, even though the graphics are low res and blurry, compared to it's non-vr mode (but this is excepted with PS4 VR anyways). But what bugs me so much I had to write this is that there are only two short tracks for VR mode and more can be unlocked only by playing the non-vr mode, or at least this is what I assume having never got very far in the career mode, while being a hardcore arcade/driving gamer (trackmania, driveclub, nfs, ...) And here's where MR4 gets nightmarish, the non-vr career game is AWFUL, the controls are awkward: the bike responds to control with a lag,  the physics are buggy: when you bump AI driver off the road, sometimes you suddenly fly great distances to completely different way you were going, graphics are in some parts very laggy (c'mon this is playstation 4! game should not lag this much!), sounds are just annoying (this large bike engine should have a low growling sound and not a high noise like a teenager's scooter or electric kitchen appliance), and the game has incredibly idiotic rating system where you before driving rate your own performance beforehand and If you don't meet it exactly, you get MINUS POINTS. I can't just figure out what the developers where thinking with this, what possible reason there could be for this ?? Overall feel of the game is very unfinished (I hope!) tested only by developers themselves and none actual real driving gamers (I know this is how it is in today's industry, but for a driving game, where the physics and playability are the nro. 1 thing, you'd except a lot more polished commercial product). I want more VR tracks but the game is so buggy, laggy and stupid-hard it makes me so angry and frustrated - why can't I just play all the VR tracks ! If all above faults were fixed and the vr mode made fully accessible, this would be actually a good game - but I except the full career VR mode targeted to PS4 Pro for more GPU juice - If something like that is coming in near future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Spit Fire Heroes is one of the worst games I've ever played. I bought this game in late 2008, and man what a mistake that was.
This game consists of 10 "missions". In these missions you and only you must eliminate hordes upon hordes upon hordes of ground,air, and naval enemies with 3 lives. The missions will have you defending points such as "cities" (aka cubes of various colors) or attacking hordes of planes/boats/tanks. The difficulty of this game ramps up to the extreme past the 5th mission and becomes nearly impossible to continue playing. The missions in this game are boring, and incredibly difficult, and not even worth your time.

The graphics are primarily just large squares of various colors. Oh one second someones ringing my phone. Oh hey its 1996! They want their 3d graphics back. Only the planes models look acceptable.

The sound "effects" are absolutely terrible. Whenever something gets shot, it makes the sound of a tin can being kicked. The engine sound is just a 3 second loop of an industrial fan. The firing of your guns also sounds like a tin can being hit. I'm fairly certain there are less then 10 sound effects in this game.

There is a multiplayer feature of this game, and it looks like it would be pretty cool, If it had download play compatibility. Multiplayer in this game requires 1+ other people making the sad mistake of owning this game, hence why I cannot speak for it.

Is there ANYTHING good this game has to offer? Fortunately for the game, Yes. Gallery lets you view all the planes in the game, and gives you the background, specs, and history of them. Unfortunately, There are only 8 planes in the gallery to view, and both the tanks and the ships are left out.

This game is a complete disaster. It's far too difficult, its incredibly boring, The graphics are terrible (except for the plane models) and the sound effects are non existent. The experience of playing this game draws many striking similarities to Big rigs. What you get when you buy this game is a gallery of 8 planes with some facts about them, and the cartridge. This game is relatively glitch free, and it deserves no more then a 2/10.  I don't recommend anyone play or buy this game unless bad games are your thing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I put the disk in and watch the intro. 'this looks promising' I thought to myself. I find myself in a bathroom and urinate in the toilet. In one cubicle I find a turd I can pick up and throw. I painted the bathroom brown. Then I draw a phallic object on the whiteboard for the military plans. The first part of the game is full of amusing things like this, and when I was playing I thought to myself 'this is the best game ever!'... And then I had to kill aliens. It all went downhill from there. The controls were clunky and it was to be quite honest, a boring experience. I would rather chuck poo in game for 8 hours than actually do what it was this game asked of me. Shocking how the game turned from great to garbage in the space of 20 minutes. Seriously, nothing fun after the intro and a complete waste of time. I'll be honest I did not finish it, but it's just like my grandfather used to say 'you don't need to finish eating a lump of faeces to know you don't like it.' 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is garbage. Played the demo and found that it was just another mediocore shooter. Graphics are terrible, and the humor is bad. Burrowed it from a friend and found out that it was exactly like the demo suggested it would be. Bargin Bin material. Emphasis on the bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Duke Nukem Forever was never going to live up to the immeasurable hype after waiting through the lifespan of the average cat duke gives us a game that will sell but only because of its past but ont to the game.Duke starts off at the fair pace take a leak says a few one liners and fights a massive alien.
so far so promising.Then its time for the real game and things go downhill fast so fast you will get motion sicknes.when you look at this game it should be measured by what it is offering/a ton of crap not its history the graphics tell the tale of its development perfectly i found these more offensive than the woman next door would find the too be honest quite crap humour.Yes its not even funny its immature but not funny immature also this will amaze you its a better expierience on pc apparently yh and i hear you can run it on the lowest of settings well how come my xbox struggles to hold this **** in.the load times are too long the random difficulty spikes the GAME ITSELF is utter bollocks it has wonky aiming and you know what ther is a wall of **** yh i mean it but back to the difficulty spikes i found myself vomiting vulgar rainbows at many points through this game i was suprised my flatmates did nott think i was getting killed or attacked by a killer sheep(it happened once)if this franchise can weather this horrific ****storm i will be suprised and if you are one of those fanboys i have this to say unlike you i can read and write hold down a paying job and tend not to foam at the mouth now please write your strongly worded 2000 letter long message with that bad gramma of yours and live your miserable life.
bye sincerly fanbanta1

--[THE GOOD]-- The unlockable extras are pretty cool- Some exciting firefights-- [THE BAD] --- ...but utterly awful boss battles- Ugly visuals plagued with slow loading textures and frame rate drops- Poor voice acting and immature, high school jock-like dialogue- Loading screen after loading screen after **** loading screen!- 'Mini Duke' sections are plain **** completely dull and infuriating- The multiplayer is everything that the word 'crap' stands for(GRAPHICS) - [3] - The graphics are a messy affair. They absolutely scream the fact that they went through three different console generations before finally settling on the current seventh generation, though they most definitely don't live up to it and there are some pretty blinding signs of older generation graphical remnants. The visuals are ugly enough, but just when you thought it could only get better it gets worse; unforgivable slow-loading textures and frequent frame rate drops plague each and every level and there are many instances where an object catches your eye and all that comes to mind is 'seriously...?'. One of the worst levels for technical fudge-ups is "The Mighty Foot", which sees Duke rollin' in a monster truck ('cos he's mega tough, of course) amidst a flurry of enemies falling through the ground, seconds-long frame rate drops and objects randomly flinging themselves around the place. You have to admire the developers' confidence that the graphics could actually be passed off as acceptable. HA!...For the full review, y'all can find it on my blog at www.garygamesouparchive.blogspot.com/2011/07/duke-nukem-forever-xbox-360.html

Out of all the Games I've watched and played. Duke Nukem Forever has to be the WORSE one I've Played for 2011! Bad Graphics, Unfair bosses, Lame Turret moments, the game practically telling you what weapons to use, a Story line no one will care about, Easy Puzzles,Horrible character animations (Seriously, if you play this watch the characters cause it is horrible to look at!),mostly lame Jokes (think the ones about the flying spaghetti monsters (Octopus) were the only ones I laughed at) And Finally, the ruining of the Duke. So I think Either a Different company should have brought Duke Nukem back, or it should have stayed dead. So to all who haven't played this Game yet, Please don't!.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is infamous for being delayed for 13 YEARS (from 1997-2011). This was originally gonna be a PS1/N64 title but due to some stupid **** this game got delayed again & again & again. It kinda shows. This game feels like it wants to be a new shooter but can't be. It's pretty bad. If you want a new, good shooter, get Battlefield Bad Company, CoD 4-BO1 or damn near anything else (just don't get Aliens: Colonial Marines or Rogue Warrior) This game sucks balls. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Damn this game was bad. After Years of waiting, we got this piece of crap. I have to say this - duke nukem games always was overrated, that being said this game is also overrated compared to meta score (4.4? for what?). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sacré tour de force que de cumuler les défauts de jouabilité d'un jeu d'une génération désuète et surannée (et pour cause, 13 ans de retard Monsieur le Duc !) aux tics de la génération actuelle, c'est-à-dire tout ce qui fait qu'Halo est Halo (quels que soient les numéros) mais évidemment, ce qui marche avec Halo ne fonctionne pas avec le cadavre du Duc (revenu des morts et ressuscité à l'insu de son ignorance).

Ainsi, la vie qui remonte toute seule et le fait de ne porter que deux armes par exemple est un choix grotesque pour un jeu aussi rétro que le Duc Pour Toujours. Sans oublier ces maudits points de sauvegarde automatique également !

Du côté rétro qui a remonté le temps jusqu'à nos jours et qui ne fonctionnait déjà pas à l'époque, on peut citer la progression par énigmes alors que Monsieur le Duc est pourtant réputé pour sa beauferie inégalée. Bourrin le Duc ? non juste chiant et depuis toujours ! A l'époque, c'était certes bien pire puisque les niveaux entiers étaient des énigmes à s'arracher les cheveux. Personnellement je n'ai plus le temps de regarder des solutions pour résoudre de tels jeux de piste : j'appuie sur "eject". En fait, à l'époque je m'amusais surtout à faire des cartes rigololes pour le multi avec l'excellent éditeur intégré, le "Build" mais point de cela ici évidemment !

Le Duc à la bourre est desservi par un moteur Unreal qu'on a du mal à reconnaître tant ce dernier est à bout de souffle : temps de chargement à la limite du scandale, crénelage à gogo et fluidité très discutable. Un bon point quand même : le doublage de Monsieur le Duc par le doubleur de Schwarzy, Sam Fisher (et Batou dans GITS !), l'excellent Daniel Beretta. Mais ça ne sauve pas les meubles hélas. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"This'll be interesting." was my first thought when putting the disc into the drive of my Xbox. This proved to be very true, although not in the way I had expected it to be. Duke Nukem Forever is a game that captures very much the essence of Duke Nukem 3D, it is indeed the same Duke we're about to meet. You really don't need more than a few minutes into the intro to realize this. Paying homage to the original is however nothing you can build an entire game on, and being true to the earlier games is the only thing that is done properly within Duke Nukem Forever. Everything else pretty much sucks. Animations are poorly made and implemented with characters displaying snapping and odd movement patterns. You play in first person view yet there is a ton of bugs related to this. Notice especially how the player seems to hover about a feet above the floor and how it's possible to trigger strafing movement without triggering the strafing animation. Facial animations are so poorly implemented that they seem to have no correlation at all with the content of their audio files. The sound is poor as well, with no considerable variations implemented at all. This makes the game sound repetitive and uninteresting. Just try to jump a few times in a row and listen to the grunting Duke lets out as he lands and you'll understand what I mean. The whole game sounds pretty much like this, apart from the few areas that have for some reason been left totally without any ambience tracks making them feel even more out of place and breaking immersion totally. Considering the competing titles Duke Nukem Forever has nothing to show when it comes to visuals either, it simply looks worse than the titles it's supposed to outrun. I've always thought that the most important thing to pull off when doing a game is the gameplay and since this game doesn't even manage that it's not worth anyones time really. There are huge sections with non-existing gameplay and nothing for the player to do while waiting for some pointless movie (with sucky facials and poor sound) to finish. If you want something that feels like the old Duke Nukem 3D but is a bit new and has boobs that you haven't seen before just replay the old game with some downloaded porno in the background, it's pretty much the same thing. And whatever you do, don't buy this game first hand, there's bound to be a huge second hand market for it within short. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I oft read other user reviews who say the game is good for nostalgia or fans of the old Duke Nukem and I really don't understand such comments. To put it in perspective, I grew up during the 3D gaming revolution: I remember buying and playing Wolfenstine 3D, Doom, Quake, Heretic, Duke Nukem, and Unreal when they were new. According to some reviewers, I should be THRILLED for Duke Nukem Forever.. But after 6 hours of playing it, I was completely disgusted by it and simply could NOT play anymore. Yes, the game looks, feels and plays dated. Yes, the voice overs are atrocious. Yes, Duke still references crappy movies of the 80s and 90s (with some more modern ones, like a line or two from "300"). But the gameplay is just boring, linear and horrendous. It feels like Gearbox took a turd - a running joke of game production gone awry - and polished it, trying to incorporate modern game designs into it, before pushing it out to say they actually brought out the game. The end result is a game that has the worst of old shooter design and the worst of new shooter design. All in all, this game was better left as a running joke and should have never seen the light of day. As for nostalgia, $60 is a steep price for a game that everyone admits still looks, feels and plays like a 1999 title. This title will be in the bargain bin soon, and thankfully so. Then, hopefully, Duke Nukem can be put to rest, as he should have been, officially, 12 years ago. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted this game to be good. After playing it for awhile, I realized it wasn't good so I just wanted this game to be something other than the garbage it was turning out to be. I knew about the graphics and animation and dated game mechanics, but none of that bothers me unless it is fun. I figured it would be good for a few laughs... it wasn't. I didn't laugh once. Jr. High School bathroom humor riddles this trash with the frequency that was really quite insulting. Did the developers really think I would find this type of humor funny? After the second tasteless abortion joke I turned this junk off and traded it in.With all of the anticipation, all the wait, all of the expectation, it really is mind boggling on where this whole thing went wrong. I think what upset me most is that they took a character that was funny with his macho bravado and quick one liners, and turned him into an unappealing jerk. I am not even interested in a Duke Nukem game if this is how they want to keep him.Hopefully Gearbox and 2K will realize their error in not fixing this game before releasing it and try to reboot it with favorable results. I will still not pre-buy it like I did this one. This is the last game I ever put on reserve for early purchase. The second time this year I have been burnt by paying full price for a horrible game.Certainly not worth $60. Not even worth $20. I would say wait a month or so when all the used game stores are trying to get rid of the surplus they have and mark it down to $3. Even then that is pushing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I knew this game was going to be very outdated when I played it, after all waiting a decade. But I had NO idea it was going to be this bad. The overuse of being shrunk, combined with LOOOOONNNGGG load times made this game pretty much unplayable. Sorry Duke, but your forever ended with this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first thing you will notice is just how poor the graphics are but that could be forgiven for a great game right?Wrong this game has so much wasted potential the idea of it is cool but the game itself is so poorly executed with  anything form bad voice acting to ridiculous fall damage.Not even the story redeems this game it is so flat and boring you will forget there even was a story.In short twin sector could have been so much more in the hands of a more capable developer or even a modder.

Rating 2/10 (Horrible) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You can earn all the achievements in 5 hours tops, if it wern't for that damn announcer who talks way to much this would be a 4+ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved the mini games we were able to download from Xbox but the actual disc game is terrible. Unresponsive controllers, long delays between the games, annoying announcer. Absolutely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is worth about $9.99 Can't believe I spent $50 on it! There is no real variation to this game at all. Limited enemy type; limited weapons; limited controls. It seems obvious that corners were cut in order to meet deadlines while programming this less-than mediocre game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was not worth my time downloading it on the free weekend( (And it was like two minutes, Max). The game was disappointing and this is coming from a person who thought that it was a good game. (Minecraft and Team Fortress 2) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Steam had lead me to believe this would be Minecraft with the elements of a FPS. It accomplished neither. I was particularly disappointed with the building aspects of the game.  I appreciate the makers concepts, however the execution was with out many merits.  Bottom line: not particularly fun to play 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never played the Beta, so I can not comment on how much better it was. I can, however, talk about how the game is today. When I first got the game, it worked... somewhat. It was fun, actually. The concept was great, the maps were good, but it crashed. A lot. In fact, the game crashed every 15-20 minutes! For a 'fully released' game, that is absolutely unacceptable! After uninstalling it, and leaving it sitting in my Steam account for a while, I decided to give it another try. I mean, the devs should have had the time to fix the bugs, right? Wrong. In fact, it is even worse now! After two crashes, the game won't even start. Literally, it just stops, right before even the black start-up screen! But the thing that really puts Ace of Spades in the hole for good is that instead of working hard to fix the bugs, Jagex is releasing DLC... Jagex is turning into EA, but without the eventual great game. (And the money) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply put, there is nothing this game has to offer that is worth your time, with poor balance, annoying controls and gun play. The original version seems better according to other people, so there is no reason to spend the money 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I told players in the forums before it was out: "don't knock it till you tried it". Well, I've tried it for a few days now and here is my impression of the game broken down into points.

The game feels and looks as if it was made by a European toy company. It looks like Legos with guns aimed at a demographic of 8-12 year olds. It seems like a rushed production where  the goal was to make it look attractive, promote it the same way you would toys, and sell as many copies as possible right after launch. They even use reviews from video game review websites/companies such as IGN, before a proper review could be made, leading to my suspicion, that as always, these sites/companies were paid for a positive review. IGN for example has been suspected many times of being paid to give a game a positive review.

The maps were made by artists and not level designers. In fact, level design seems to be non-existent in the maps. It feels more like artists took inspiration from levels from other games and made an attempt to make maps like them. With no destructible terrain, the maps might be half decent. No one that worked on the levels took into account how destructive the classes/weapons are and did not use that knowledge in designing. However, those who designed the levels themselves do not seem to have either the knowledge or experience to design proper maps. For example, the map: London Bridge, has spawn points for both teams somewhat perpendicular to the orientation of the bridge. In other words, rather than facing eachother from opposite sides of the bridge and thus the bridge would become a key element in map control, the bridge is nothing more than useless eye candy. Both teams spawn practically on one side of the bridge and face eachother over a curving part of river. Both teams also spawn on one side and corner of the map, rather than exactly opposite eachother.

Lastly, I understand at launch, every game has bugs in it that eventually get fixed. Ace of Spades 1.0 however not only has shoddy netcode, but it also seems to suffer from many memory leaks. The clientside to server side updating is some of the most horrible I've ever seen. Sometimes, it seems like the server can't decide if you hit an enemy or haven't or where you really are on the map. I can't count how many times I warped back and forth between 2 coordinates. The memory leaks are noticeable from the graphics. Even at the lowest settings on a fast system with a new card, more than adequate ram, high end processor, the FPS is still all over the place and gradually degrades as you play the game. From a programming perspective, I'm starting to be suspicious that they took the original engine and layered all the new elements in the game on top of it and hoped that it would be able to handle a heightened graphic level and many more effects such as increased particle effects. If this is true, the original engine is getting bogged down by all the extra work and was not originally designed to handle so much.

In summary, like I said, if feels like it was made by a toy company for the sole purpose of immediate profits. It really does look and feel like someone took Legos and weapons and threw them into pot and then pushed the digital version of that pot out the door as fast as possible.  And I'm saying that while trying to be straightforward and give an honest opinion without hate or any negative intent.

I think it's going to take Jagex a lot of work to fix the list of problems with their game, if they would like to continue to make money off of it. I support any company that wants to sell a game. Game making is very hard work and takes a lot of resources. However, quality is what makes or breaks a game. Time will tell. Buyer beware. Buy the game if you feel that there is still promise there and that they can still improve to a point of being a quality game. Thanks for reading,

A good idea based of an old MC mod, to create a stand alone game based on MC but more fighting and of course guns. Trouble is, it has been poorly executed. The game lacks features such as single player for practice and is very unclear on how to create games with friends if there is a way. The game play itself is not fluid enough to enjoy, with absolutely no balancing. Most of all is the abundance of hackers. Updates need to happen soon as people paid for this and deserve better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another reminder to check Metacritic review before jumping on Steam's sale bandwagon.  I bought the 4 pack because it looked like a change of pace for the fam.  I couldn't even start gameplay because (even though it is an option), LAN is disabled.  There is no server app either (I understand there used to be one for older revs).  My son played on the public server, and he said it was just ok.  But I have no interest in that, since I want my own private server via local LAN.  So, this was another $15 flushed.

That said, I still think this game could be saved.  The dev just has some real work to do... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think this game could be better, the game isn´t well executed, but the idea is good. Try to work more to get the public. This game could be better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OK, before I gave it praise, but I need to take that back. THEY KILLED IT. It was good, no it is complete and total, in laymen's terms,  The freaking paid DLC doesn't help either. And the new Classic Mode doesn't save the game either, because it is NOTHING LIKE CLASSIC! Jagex took a great game and blew it to pieces. Do not buy this game, no matter what. I thought it could still be saved, but no. The community sucks too. That's adding insult to injury. It  sucks because this game had great potential, but not anymore. I don't care if it's 10 dollars, 5 dollars, or even 2 dollars. It's a waste of time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't know how I felt about this game when I saw it on Steam. Initially I thought that the whole "TF2 and Minecraft mixed together" concept was interesting but probably would make a good combination, but after a while, I bought the game when it was on sale. I can safely say that I wasted my money. The classes suck, the game modes have been done before and done better in other games  the maps are way too big and half the time I'm just looking for someone to shoot, the "Minecraft" concept is extremely lacking, and the game is just terrible overall. If done well, this could've been an interesting shooter, but you're better off jut keeping TF2 and Minecraft separate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I saw this game on a steam sale and saw some videos on it. It seemed legit and I bought it. Big mistake. The game itself seems decent, but it was unplayable on my computer for some reason, poorly optimized. I can run minecraft just fine, which has just about the same graphics as this game, if not better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only reason I was interested in buying the new version was because of the nostalgia I felt for the fantastic free version which Ben Aksoy developed by his self. It was a simple, fun little time waster which you could play on practically any computer, with a fantastic creative community.

This game however has taught me that I should always check a game's Metascore before I go ahead and waste £8.99.
The new version is like a bad ripoff of TF2; they try to give personality to the different classes but I quite frankly didn't give a crap about them. I find it ironic that a game which originally had so much creativity now has the most unoriginal gameplay and game modes. The original only had one game mode, which was capture the flag, and there was a lot of potential for Jagex to come up with new ones to compliment the building and creative aspects of the game. In reality, what they give us are Deathmatches and CTFs with no original content and a completely dull zombie mode with terrible AI which basically makes it Call of Duty and Minecraft's ugly lovechild.

What was creative and fun about the original is now ruined. Building, which was the main aspect of the game, is now completely pointless because of the miner class being able to completely obliterate any blocks in a couple of seconds. Weapons are stupidly inaccurate, making it nigh on impossible to feel like you are getting a good clean shot at all and I had some terrible lag issues, with players jerking around all over the place and the weapons being even more inaccurate then they already are.

I find it insanely depressing how Jagex, a company with a huge dedicated team, could make a worse game than one guy who programmed the original by himself. What's worse is, this horrible FPS actually has a large amount of fans all over the world who defend the game to the very end. Jagex have completely taken a dump on a game I knew and loved a year ago. The only reason I'm not giving it a 0 is because the game features one good feature from the original, the graphics, and enhances it giving a nice visual feel to the game, but that is literally all I liked about it. Seriously, I urge you not to waste money on this piece of trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The developers need to think their own idea not to steal other games concept.

Seeing this game was f2p is a better idea than adding a price for it because game is not really complete.The company bought the original ace of spades the turn it into a tf2 and worms rip off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This used to be a fun game. The alpha was very fun, albeit a bit flawed but I still played it for over 30 hours. Then the first parch came. For one they added a laser sight to the sniper rifle. Now the sniper rifle was OP but now whenever you scoped in EVERYBODY could see where you were. They added new skins which looked horrible and made the game iffy. The St. Valentines massacre DLC was horrible. It added some actually pretty cool maps that if other game modes were allowed on them they would have been fun. The game modes it added nobody played and it cost 4.99. That was the beginning of the end. The next patch ruined the game completely. For one they removed the rocketeer class and added the "engineer" class which was incredibly weak and jet pack took several minutes to recharge. The maps were already laggy but then you couldn't actually choose which server you'd be on so most of the time you would be matched to an empty server. Completely horrible. A few months ago I'd say go ahead and buy it and play the fudge out of it but now stay far, far away from it. All it will bring you is tears. It makes me sad to see such a good game ruined. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game used to be so great. So fun. Just so amazing.

But then this one patch came, ruined the whole game.

The patch consisted of a overpriced DLC, it is quite good and way better than the game itself, but not worth the money really.

Exterme unbalance. A very large and dumb nerf to the engineer (now the only reason people use him is because he's actually decent fun to play around with) A very large buff to the previously balanced sniper. Imagine team fortress 2, the sniper. Except with WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY larger maps with no cover to hide behind, larger head hitboxes, larger bodyshot damage, more view when scoping, and full still great hip-fire accurucy. As well as the best mobility in the game. And then they nerfed some other items like grenades and such.

The removal of half the items in the game. Yeah you heard me. They just randomly removed half of the items in the game for no reason, one being the awesome glider. You previously had a lot of choice when it comes to the weapons you could use, but not now.

And finally them just permanently leaving the game. There hasn't been a single patch since.

The only fun that you can get from this game now is playing either zombies or classic. But classic gets boring after a while (especially because of how most teams just turtle in their base), and zombies is just not that good.

Don't buy this game, it looks much better than it actually is. Especially if you look at pre-patch content- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When i bought the game, I had to download a patch for the mouse to work. It is frustrating to play, especially the lack of control of individual troops. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty sucky graphics, lack of monsters, weapons and armors, very buggy, the spells are worth shit, 1 character type (though it is in male and female, there is no difference.) And many more negative things. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrendous. A password-based save system? I thought we were searching for treasure, not lost progress. Poor gameplay. An unbelievably poor representation of Jack Sparrow, as a bald-headed, naive, uncertain apprentice. Zero connection to the actual movie. Poor all the way around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are thinking of buying this game, make sure you rent it first before spending your money. The controls and camera are broken, the characters are unrecognizable, the story and dialogue are cheesy, and the gameplay is tedious. IGN went pretty easy on it (maybe because they are advertising the game), just read some of these other reviews to get a true picture of how flawed it is. Awful attempt at a fanservice game, and a very flawed fighter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a spit in the face to players everywhere. Its poorly thought out, the side missions are a joke and its WAY too short a game to be worth what it is. I am complaining to Activision about this aswell. 14 main missions between 15-30 mins of your time does not a game make! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

after giving the amazing spiderman 2 another go and being patient I could see the potential the game has. unfortunately the amazing spiderman  2 is still a mediocre game. The story has it's interesting points but again it is a boring and terrible story. The controls is still terrible and to difficult to get use to, the camera movement get very annoying and is a big factor why spiderman 2 is such a terrible game.

For a PS4 game the graphics is shocking it looks more like a PS2 game rather than a PS4 game I would have thought since the game was in development so long the developers would have been able to make this a game with stunning graphics suitable for a PS4 but instead we get PS2 style graphics.

The Amazing Spiderman 2 has a lot of potential if the developers took longer to develop a well oiled and well crafted game another 12 months this would possibly have been a great game and possibly one of the best games in 2015. But instead it is one of the worst games I have ever played.

My first review I gave the Amazing Spiderman 2 a 1/10 but having given it another chance I see the potential and see what the developers aimed to achieve but no matter how long I play the game it still fails to impress me.

If you are considering buying the Amazing Spiderman 2 I recommend renting it first or wait at least until it hits the bargain bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing spiderman 2 i decided it would be of better use of my time to cut the grass with a pair of safety scissors, then paint my lawn white. its like the people who made the game baked a delicious pie and then they through it in the trash where it belongs. i was being a bit harsh but the game overall was not a well put together game. theres not much to be said. it's as if the game makers just stopped working and picked their noses all day. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a mess! i felt like the director of the game just don't want to make the game so people come to him "is that dialogue fine?" and he like "Yea yea, just put it in....." i can't enjoy this game, even if i want to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a hardcore fan of the anime, this game was a disappointment. Let's start with the fact that Donkey, Fiona, and Lord Farquaad aren't present. Seriously? They were very important characters to the anime. The plot is very faithful either. This game is almost as much of a disgrace as SpongeBob retconning the universe right as Gary got character development. The controls are **** and the only saving grace this game has is the art style, which is very reminiscent of the anime.

Overall, **** this game. Kill it with fire, my fellow weeaboos 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A.I.?? What AI? This game blows... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A long time player of Ubisoft games, it was immediately apparent not even minutes into the opening cutscene that this game is a blatant ripoff of Prince of Persia. (I've also played God of War, but saw no similarities with this game) Garshasp (the protagonist) looks EXACTLY like the Prince, and combat, movement, graphics - everything looks like Prince of Persia, allbeit with a different scale, lower quality graphics, and a poorer engine. The skybox was nonexistant, and the sound was bad both in quality and choice. It was painful to listen to.Combat was absurdly easy and simplistic to the point of being boring, and the graphics just caused the game to be an eyesore. It straddles this awkward line of being more advanced than a 2d platformer, but so unpolished and simplistic that it became ugly. Aliasing was a HUGE issue, and movement felt clunky. There were several times I would be attacking an enemy as it approached, only to end up ON TOP of the enemy - LITERALLY standing on its head.Understandably, it's from an Iranian indie studio, which carries its own set of connotations, however they could've really stood to do some further playtesting to iron out small (but annoying and longstanding) bugs and to improve game balance to provide something more challenging and fun to play. AND SOMETHING MORE ORIGINAL PLEASE.It loses most of its points for me strictly for being an obvious ripoff of Ubisoft games that predate it, and loses the rest of the points for general lack of polish. This FEELS like it's from an indie studio, unlike other indie games that are very polished, beautiful, and fun to play. Instead of inventing their own "gimmicks" to draw players, they rely on ones created by other companies, which entirely ruins the game for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garshasp the monster slayer feels extremely dated and does not deliver what you come to expect from a fighting/adventure game. The visuals are outdated, the camera get annoying, the fighting feels shallow and unresponsive and the games has some bugs. Overall the game feels outdated and though it could have been good a couple of years ago it just doesnt feel up to todays standards. I would only recommend this title to those who really love the genre and are looking for something new to try out for a cheap buck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst game I have ever played. I do not have to say anything more. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game will last you less than an hour, which wouldn't be a problem if that hour wasn't a crushingly dull one being told an eye-rollingly clumsy and unconvincing story through an aggressively mediocre gameplay experience.

You think the trailer and premise shows promise? None of that promise is realised.

The soundtrack is pretty good, at least. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well as an anticipated bridge between THQ's UFC next installment, and the lost but not forgotten EA MMA I had hopes that a new MMA game with some deeming quaities may actually bring about some good competition.

Oh how wrong could i have been. From the developer going on about what the game would do and their take on MMA and the gritty underbelly of the up and comers...bla bla bla,

What is delivered is a poor mans hill billy cousin to MMA and fighting as a whole. The old and i mean old killer instinct did a much better job of the blood and brutal fighting wrapped in a 2 dimensional fight and that was 20 years ago.

If you want 2 minutes of poor punches, kicks, and fighter that doesnt even have a create your own fighter or career aspect at all, then hire it, buy it to return it the next day or add another coaster to your collection as Supremacy MMA achieves nothing more than being a supreme waste of the name MMA on a boring out dated gaming model.

So much for the competition THQ, your all by yourself. AGAIN. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am going to be as honest about this as I can be. I personally have an issue with one of the employees at Ready At Dawn Studios. Eric Cappello, who is the current associate sound designer, is a new recruit to the team. He is just an amateur and I personally don’t want his work in any of the games that Ready At Dawn is producing. His work is ruining the quality of the games that are being made by the company. In my honest opinion, he is not ready to work for the game developer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful game! The only good on Dragon Ball Z for Kinect are the graphics and the story mode. But the rest is a disaster, the Kinect answer is terrible, the gameplay is really weird and all the game is very boring. Dragon Ball Z for Kinect can sounds like a good idea, but when you play the final ressult, you can have a big deception. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who loves the dragon Ball z franchise I was really hyped for this game but the moment I started this game, I realized that the kinect ruins almost every single way.I have no idea how they thought that the kinect could do anything good for us.The combat sucks, the 2 player mode sucks, the single-player sucks, the only thing that works is the story which is by the way average. Do not **** MY BELOVED FRANCISES KINECT!!!!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Same as ultimate disappointment, but with everything on an even worser level, and  with awful kinect controls.
Yet another cancer giving and gaming industry kiling game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is garbage. It had the same Graphics as ut Tenkaichi. The gameplay feels repetitive and boring. When i played the game and just puchned in the air i felt stupid. There is only a story mode which is an huge flaw. The only good thing was the super sayan bardock episode 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just Dance doesn't work. It's a disgrace to the Wii's casual gamer market, as it is a pitiful substitute to actually playing some albums, getting some friends round and ACTUALLY dancing, not looking like a tool. Sure, there are decent songs on the game, but frankly, for a game aimed at those that haven't picked up a gaming controller at all, or in a long time, it's just a joke. To quote an internet meme, Ubisoft, I am disappoint. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

BAD 2

Sorry but I'm not one for giving terrible reviews until now....

Frame rate is that of 1990's

20 minutes in to the game and I couldn't bare to play anymore.

I will keep this game as it does look like it could be decent with the weapons customising etc but that's even if a patch unravels! If not then this will be a shocking moment for gaming, especially in 2016 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, game play isn't exactly the right term.  The first two hours have been about 80 percent really bad movie (that you'd can't skip), 5 percent loading and about 15 percent game play.

Most of that game play has been of the "follow me" variety to set up the narrative with no choice availble.

Movement: I have a topic about the poor movement system already posted, and I've finally figured out exactly how it feels.  Have you ever played a PC game that didn't have a controller option available, so you used a program like Xpadder to map the keyboard to a controller?  It's that bad.  The controls make you feel like you're floating and unresponsive.  It's, by far, the absolutely worst movement system I've played on a console.

Frame rate:  The frame rate appears average to below average, but there are so many points where it lags for no reason, it feels like it's in an early alpha.  Even when it's not in combat, the lag happens every minute or so, if not more.  Something as simple as going through a window or around a corner causes it, and it's about 2-3 seconds of lag each time.

Save System: Remember the early 2000's when you restarted the checkpoint and had to go all the way back to the cut screen and watch it again?  Welcome back.  Instead of starting after the cut screen, the few times I've tied (mostly from getting annoyed at not knowing where to go and just running blindly until I was shot giving me a brief but sweet relief from the poor game play), it's put me back before the last cut screen to watch whatever short video led me to this point.

After about two hours of "playing" the game, I haven't done anything.  The acting/voice acting is terrible.  The plot is ridiculous and isn't even feasible.  Without giving any spoilers away, it's like a ten year old thought of the plot and the developer ran with it, amazingly with no understanding of politics, weapons building and purchasing, and common sense.

I guess it's supposed to be an alternative time line as well considering the "history" of North Korea is incredibly different (and outpaces the technology of the rest of the world).

I really enjoyed the first game considering it flew under the radar when it was released.  I had very high hopes this game would be good.

So far, this has been a bad purchase.  Beware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game should never had been made. It was crap during beta and it is bad now. Short and sweet. Save your money. Do not buy it even if it is 90% off. This game is crap 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this a 2 because it isn't so bad that it deserves a 0, but I would suggest renting it first, that way, you won't have spent over £30 buying it, then finding out that you don't like it, but if you are going to sell it, don't get too excited, you'll probably only make £10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll try to make this simple: this game simply is not fun. It's not going to appeal to fans of shoot-em-up arcade-style games or the sim crowd. Everything about this game, except for the selection of aircraft is sub-par or worse. Avoid at all costs. If you just can't help yourself, at least rent it before you buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

you want a generic boring story with an overpowered ai as an enemy for a card game pick this game up...you'll probably end up throwing this game on the trash bin.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lower your expectation greatly, then prepare to still be disappointed.  It's a linear game that tries not to be.  Run around in circles in the same small area doing quests while you "level up" meeting various NPCs that all look exactly the same having you doing completely uninspired repetitive tasks.  Graphics are good, controls are good, game play and story are bad.  It's like taking the bad parts of three different games and putting them in a blender and having to drink the results.  Most games have a big bad evil guy at the end you have to beat.  This game has a big bad evil guy trying to charge you money to play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is broken and doesn't work whatsoever a month into launch you still can't find a ranked match for Xbox one, and will lag out of more than half the private matches you join, also the game is full of bugs and glitches the facial expressions when the characters look scared are hilariously bad, they should have waited till fall to winter to release the game cause it's in a terrible state. That being said the gameplay as counselor and Jason is pretty fun. As Jason you will be doing anything in your power to kill them before they escape or the time runs out, giving gruesome funny kills. As counselor its a scary experience such as when you are trying to get away in a car and Jason stands right in front of you, or when you are escaping by boat and Jason is following you. The gameplay is good but it gets repetitive after a couple hours. Overall the game would be a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, but because of how broken the game is and how hard it is to even play it or get a match it's definitely a 2, 3 or 4 at it's current state, it may be a bit better on pc but for Xbox one it's pretty awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the WORST Vita game I've had. Just yesterday got a Vita with Resistance: Burning Skies and Uncharted: Golden Abyss. They both were awesome. Today I got this, and this is just crap. I feel like the game developer is laughing at me for buying this game. It has too little content to begin with. The content it has isn't all that great either. An its got atrocious graphics when compared to the other two Vita games. Just nothing seems to be right. I gave it a 2 for whatever content it offers. Seriously, I'm being generous. Please, I solemnly advice you to NEVER even think of buying this game cuz there are other Vita titles which deserve your money better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nobody played the original Pokemon Rumble games for the terrible arena fights, the trail levels were what kept the game interesting. By making a game comprised solely of boring and soulless arena fights I don't feel I can trust the Pokemon Rumble franchise anymore 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible addon that is far from fun. This addon SHOULD OF BEEN FREE because ITS ALREADY ON THE DISK. Volition is terrible. They abusing there long time saints row series fans with this horrible game and its uber retarded add ons. do NOT and i mean DO NOT buy this add on! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not worth $5. Boring, linear, insipid gameplay. If you MUST have a short, linear, boring game, then at least go get Killzone Liberation (used and cheaper from gamestop.) It is a superior game, though that is not saying much.

Having read some of the 10/10 reviews here, I purchased the game.  Only for it to dawn on me that the developer has obviously penned a few of them.

Whilst looking like eye candy, the game itself offers little variety in visuals, the controls are just gosh darn awful and there's no excuses for releasing the game so woefully underdeveloped.  Dips in frame rates, scenery pop-up and awfully long loading times, this should not be in the store in its current state and Yanim Studio need to learn a lesson here.  If I'd have backed their Kickstarter campaign, I'd honestly want my money back.  After reading all of the hype around the campaign a year ago, it really did pique my interest, they obviously have a great PR company behind them, because this is not the game that was originally promised.

It feels like a compromise has been made, to rush the game to store at a certain date without fear of repercussion.  With a bit more love, care and attention, Red Goddess: Inner World would be a beautiful title; the strong narrative needs strong gameplay and as it stands, it's not delivered.

Yanim Studio, you need to go back to the drawing board.  Your first game fails to meet expectation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surely this isn't a finished product. It took around 20 minutes from putting in the disc to actually beginning the mission cutscene, which was very buggy/full of audio lag and eventually just froze. I'll bet they're hoping not many people buy this version, or else I can see a class action lawsuit in someone's future. :) Shame on you, Pi Studios. If they were only going to give you two weeks to make this port, you should've just turned down the offer rather than making yourselves look so inept. Must've needed the money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This garners two points by having an innuendo in the title. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As I play this game I think only one thing... How "hack&slash"/"RPG" game can be sooooooo boring...
And more than that: why FPS drops sooo badly in the game? Couldn't they optimized graphic to PS Vita? It is possible! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was subjected to this game by my friends' 7-year old son. The game makes wanton use of comic sans, which tells you every thing you need to know, really. I so frequently found myself unable to control my character because of the awful camera you're provided with as player 2 that I had to dictate this review to my friend just to keep my brain occupied. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Broken. Not much more needs to be said.  The game came out in an unfinished state and that is inexcusable.  I love final fantasy, but will skip this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Still playing, level 25 atm.Rushed release, anyone who doesn't think so isn't 20+.SE needs to rehaul a lot of things, long time fan of their franchises but terrible choices here.Anyone who defends moronic decisions around their designs is in denial. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics are the only redeeming quality to this game. The game is missing everything that you would come to expect from a modern MMO. And worst of all, there is nothing to do but GRIND. The VAST majority of quests are just "kill X of monster Y" or "Collect X items by killing monster Y". And even then, you can only do a tiny amount of these quests because they are locked out on a 48 hour timer. Trust me people, steer clear of this game until AT LEAST the first expansion. If it even makes it that far.

It has been about four years since I began waiting for this game. Originally known as Rapture, the game was said to be the next generation of MMORPG. I would like to preface this by saying I have played more than half of the Final Fantasy titles and beaten them, and on the other hand, I have played a handful of MMORPGs including FFXI.The Good:- Graphics: The game looks fantastic. Characters are alive and beautiful, and the armor in the game is incredibly detailed. I'd say this game has the best graphics of any MMORPG to date.- Sound: While not one of the better Final Fantasy soundtracks, the music is definitely solid. Sound effects from attacks to footsteps are very convincing and add to the atmosphere of the game.The Bad:- Performance: This game simply isn't optimized. Many players, including myself, have powerful rigs but still chug along. Granted the graphics are great, but the scalability is deplorable. If you don't have a recently-upgraded PC, don't bother.- Interface: I think the best way to sum this up is to say the decade-old Final Fantasy XI had a better UI. Navigation of the interface is unbearable at times, and adds minutes of wasted time. The game has been developed with the console in mind, so navigation with a controller is optimal, but is still incredibly tedious and archaic. You can't sort your interface, and everything seems to take twice as many steps as it should. Want to sell some items? Well, you'll have to go through a handful of dialogue boxes just to sell 1 item. Games for the last few years have been using what we call the "right click" on the mouse. Why doesn't this game in 2010 have it? Oh, and targeting is incredibly bad.- Lag: Inputs take seconds to execute. This adds to a "clunky" experience both in combat and out. Yes, the game is new, but Square Enix should have at least allowed client-side interactions. Everything needs to be communicated to the server in Japan meaning everything you do has to be registered on the server before it executes. Frustrating to say the least.- Gameplay: To enter combat, you have to press a button to take out your weapon. This leaves you standing in 1 place for about 2-3 seconds while your character pulls out your weapon. Animations are slow and must be completed, so if you want to use abilities quickly in combat, good luck. The combat isn't very fun either. Abilities aren't very interesting or varied, and interactions are clunky.- No tutorials: This game makes you feel lost, very lost. Square Enix doesn't seem to have taken the precautions to help people figure the game out. When crafting items, there are no recipes, so you'll have to use pen and paper. During missions, you'll be left guessing who to talk to. Instructions are nowhere to be found. Heck, nobody even tells you how to switch classes, you'll have to refer to the internet for that.- Controls: No key mapping for the keyboard means you're stuck with some ridiculous keybindings set by Square Enix. Controls are easily the worst in any MMORPG in the last decade and reek of 20th century.- Content: Chocobos are in the game but no way to ride or interact with them. Grinding. Lots of grinding. Quests with no purpose. You can't see your party members on the map. Very few search options ingame. No /invite command. The list goes on and on.- Market system: No auction house. If you want a specific item, you'll be left begging in /shout and searching through hundreds if not thousands of bazaars to find the item.This game is inconvenient. Very inconvenient. It feels like a game from over 10 years ago but with modern graphics. This game was advertised as being welcoming to casuals, but running around takes ages and the combat is slow. Leveling takes an eternity and the lack of direction is evident. This is the most disappointing game I've played in years. I don't recommend it to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played this in both the open beta and on release, and I've never seen a game that has come out with so many flaws and problems. Just like FFXI, the entire basis of the game is the advancement of a linear storyline... and that's it. The game boasts impressive in-game art, graphics, and cinematics, but the gameplay is boring and repetitive. Once you get through your first few starting quests, you are left to do repeatable daily quests in one of three categories: Battle, crafting, and gathering. So basically you are left doing daily quests in a very similar fashion to World of Warcraft's endgame play, only that is what you will be doing for the entire length of the game. To make matters worse, the combat controls make working in a group a pain, as they do not allow for point and click casting. A redundant target select is built into the game so that people with gamepads can keep their eye on one target while healing people around it, but this only complicates PC controls.The crafting in this game is a carbon copy of the Final Fantasy XI crystal crafting system with an unintuitive mini-game added on top. You have no recipe list, so you must look up all the recipes online at their website and you also have no way to tell if the item is too difficult for you to craft at your given skill. This also means you must manually put in all the materials for the item into a grid of boxes before you start crafting. Once at the mini-game, new players will be left scratching their heads in frustration as they vainly try to learn the crafting mini-game with a complete lack tutorials. Sure, if the player is smart enough to pick up the crafting tutorial quest back at the city he will have something to work with, but the tutorial fails to explain the intricacies of the game, such as what the pretty light on your crafting tool represents. Also, when you fail at making an item, all the ingredients you meticulously collected are destroyed, only adding to player frustration. The gathering mini-game trades the frustration for boredom, and is just as unintuitive as the crafting mini-game. Thankfully the introductory gathering quest is helpful here, but "hot and cold" mini-games belong in the realm of things to do on long car trips when we don't have advanced electronic devices available to us, not in a video game. At least not in the unintuitive, and rather dull application it is applied here. The player market is a mess as well. Square went with a Bazaar system as opposed to an Auction House, and since the economy is mostly player run (think like 90%), this ends up creating a convoluted mess. You will be stuck searching through an army of retainers (the npcs that player hire out to put their stuff on) for close to an hour before finding what you want. The costs will also be either out the roof or ludicrously low due to their being no way for players to gauge the marketplace in order to set a good price for their goods.The game's physics engine is a rip straight out of Final Fantasy XI as well, meaning poor interaction with the environment and no swimming or jumping. You are guaranteed to always be on the ground in this game. The only improvement that this game boasts over its predecessor is the fact that it allows for solo play. This is nothing to be proud about, however, since that has been standard issue in MMOs for at least the last 5 years. So basically we have a game system that is a carbon copy of the Final Fantasy XI system with the only difference being repeatable quests and solo play. The only thing to look forward to is the storyline, but we've moved far beyond linear stories with games such as Baldur's Gate, Dragon's Age, and Fallout. Nothing to be proud of here folks, and certainly not worth wasting your money on. Pretty graphics give this two stars, but ancient game-play mechanics on top of endless player frustration gives this a 0 in game-play category.2 out of 10 for this one folks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has made absolutely no improvements to the genre, every major feature is incomplete or riddled with bugs or downright bad in it's  implementation. You'll find yourself dropped into an unfamiliar (by mmo standards) world with absolutely no technical guidance and UI that seems straight out of a '99 console game; all of this while running code so poorly optimized for the PC  that it makes GTA 4 (a notoriously bad console port) seem like the holy grail of solid FPS.All of this is truly baffling coming from Square-enix who should have had previous MMO experience. If you've played ANY mmo before get ready for some serious WTF'ing; if you've played FFXI and were hoping for the next-gen group based experience you'll be so furious you'll write a negative review on Metacritic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow i don't even know where to begin.1. The UI is a joke horribly slow and confusing2. Overall controls are sluggish it feels like im slogging through water trying to move my mouse " and NO i dont want to play with a frikin controller I shouldn't HAVE to"3. Spellcasting is overly tedious , I have to target mob, select spell, hit enter, hit spell agian ..just to cast a spell?! WTF?!4. Crafting is horribly slow and painful and so much downtime waiting for menus to popup5. Fun Factor = 0 NOTHING in this game is fun to do, everything is a CHORE everything requires insane amounts of time to do mainly because of the horrid ui and controls.6. Con system, Has anyone actually figured out how to con mobs yet? Should it be this difficult to figure it out?7. Combat, slow and boring it makes me want to fall asleep its so boring8.Quests are tedious and boring I don't even know where to begin9. forming a guild/linkshell is a pain in the ass. Do you have ANY idea how ridiculously hard it will be to invite people to a large guild if you have to meet EVERYONE in person to actually do it?10. Chat system is horrible is it even possible to reply to someone w/o having to type there name out all the time ? Should it be this hard to figure it out?11.Death, It took me 10 minutes to figure out that when i died i had to open my menu and hit return...thats ridiculous I had to figure out what to do when I die. Unacceptable.12. Terrain , SO MUCH COPY PASTE its so obvious that they copied so much terrain its not even funny.13. The world map, we really can't zoom in or out? Really? No really?! wow....This is quit possibly the WORST mmo I have ever played and that's really saying something. I've been gaming for over 15 years now and this is literally the worst. Even ff11 played better than this and its not that much better. It literally makes me want to spread the word out and make sure no one ever even thinks of buying this horrible excuse for an mmo. How anyone could possible give this game a good score is beyond me. They either are complete and total FFanbois or have just never actually played a good mmo before and are basing this game off of FFXI other than that it makes no sense when there are so many obvious flaws with this game they practically scream out to you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(sorry for Grammar, not main language)I really really want to like this game. I've played FFXI for 3 yrs and had a lot of fun with it. However, FFXIV is not what I enjoy. I don't feel like I want to log in because there is nothing to do after I completed all battle leves. I tired crafting and harvesting but it's so boring - take so long time to do anything and I don't like it. So I have War and Magic to play. I have no choice but to grind mildessly , run kill , run kill  errrr I just wonder I am playing RAGNAROK ONLINE 2010???  ... Also the skill up is buggy somehow or it's broken... I am Conjuror I suppose to skill up by casting magic such as Thunder , .. etc  but belive it or not , after running around for 2 hour I've found that the best way to get skill up is spamming Spirit dart until enemy die even I use cure while fighting is not gain any skill point ... it's so strange and stupid I feel. Also, I feel sorry for those who don't have active Linkshell or Friends. They have no one to talk with! Nobody talk anything even in the Aetherite camp. Grats whoever get into LS and have a group going .. oh did I mention, as a Conjuror, in order to gain class skill in party as much as other melee class, I have to spam spirit dart as well! becuz I can't cast spell. I get aggro immediatly from only 1 heal  or 1 nuke or 1 MPrecoverSkill  - I've play EQ1 EQ2 FFXIV and I think I know by now the aggro system for caster or healer or Do FFXIV use other rule for aggro management ? If so they should have it in manual or something. Furthermore, why there's no Dev team or Community manager that communicate with player. Why SE never talk with their players? Where is official forum?  All they have is Feedback system which won't be responded and E-mail system that takes about 3 days to get Copy-paste answer ... I can go on with so many disappointed things in this game.  Sorry I feel very bad now I invest so much money to play this game. I bought a new computer i7 960 / GTX 480 / etc  just to play this game and I thought at that time my money is worth it. Even in Beta, my friend told me it's better to use Controller and I bought it immediately in hope many things will be fixed when its released  but it's isn't ....  Map , Bazaar , Trade , even selling item to NPC is terrible .. slow and too much unnecessary progress... and WHY in the world I had to assigned the drop to myself when I am soloing ? I just don't understand...  This is much worse than EQ2 Launch ... sorry for FFXIV fan ( I am also FF fan too but I had to speak the truth) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to give this game a score of two.  I think this is a fair score considering they didn't F up two things. Graphics - AWESOME!  10/10

Stability - Pretty damn good here for me and a couple of friends of mine.  I crashed once, but I think it was my fault.  I crashed hourly during Age of Conan's launch.  9/10

Everything else (i.e. the bazaar system, leve system, macro system, equipment/character level progression...) Sucks big.  I understand it takes a little time for the market to mature and such, but other than that I don't see a game overhaul happening to fix the other things I don't like.  0/10

I wouldn't recommend this game, there are more mmo titles just around the corner.  As a side note, this doesn't surprise me, I thought FF13 sucked too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a most definitely "wait and see", or "skip entirely".  Major problems exist, caused by the game not containing the basics of an mmorpg.  The UI issues can almost be forgiven.  The terrible performance can be overlooked.  But the lack of content, missing of core systems (even the map doesn't work properly), terrible billing system, and complete lack of direction to this game is the nail in the coffin.  Do not buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game simply because I'm a fan (but not so much anymore) of the Final Fantasy series.  I was hoping FFXIV would be a step forward from FFXI (as I really didn't like FFXI at all).  Unfortunately, it isn't.  In fact, it almost feels like a step back.  Yes, graphics are nice, but the UI is just horrid.  Everything feels clunky and slow.  Developers certainly didn't have user-friendliness in mind when they planned FFXIV.Lack of quests and content is also appalling.  You get around 15 minutes of playable content every 36 hours (Guildleve system).  There is no auction house as of now (I don't know if one is planned), so getting new items and trading is a NIGHTMARE.  Believe me.For hardcore fans only, and even then, I'm sure SE just hurt themselves badly by releasing this unfinished and incomplete product. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Final Fantasy chapters should not be online, and if it is done, at least that is brilliant. It is not the case. The worst Final fantasy with a ton of really annoying bugs, restricting chat system and many wrong ideas. What demons is happen with Final Fantasy? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just don't understand how a company as large as SE can make such a glaringly flawed game, it has already been mentioned many times but the flaws far outweigh the and positives.  The atrocious UI was my biggest gripe, I can't even begin to describe how much I loathed it.  I do believe there is potential but for a game to be released like this is an insult to gamers, shame on SE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They rushed this game out the door so fast they didn't have time to bribe their usual gaming websites.- Played FFXI since launch and loved it - Has been waiting for this game since the project rapture tech demo they released in around 2006- Invested $600 in PC upgrades to be able to max this game out - Played the Beta and thought things were going to get better once retail hit- Bought the Collector's Edition gleefullyEven I can't deny this game is complete and utter ****I've tried to lie to myself, tell myself it's going to get better, but the Square MMO team are complete frackups, as clearly laid out by FFXI. Somehow, they managed to make a game that takes all the good of FFXI and turns it to **** and then took a huge steaming **** on top of it, and put a cherry on top for the beautiful graphics.This game is abysmal. It's a complete failure. I'm a fraking Finfan fanboy for fracksake, and I can't stand this pile of horse**** Here's to hoping Guild Wars or that bland looking Starwars MMO can finally pull me away from the cesspool that is WoW. As for this game, I just hope they shut down the servers quickly before too many people find out about it so it isn't etched into everyone's minds as the biggest failure in MMO history. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

3 points por graphics,-1 point because resources optimization doesn't exist in this game.The rest is very poor.The worst numeric final fantasy.Compared with other mmorpg,ffivx is boring,frustrating,and very expensive,and doesn't have any innovations.What a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to love XIV, I really did. I bought this game knowing there was a huge chance it would be hard to get into and a major timesink like FFXI was. In fact, I WANTED that. I played FFXI for over 4 years and those years were the highlight of my gaming history. But what I got instead was some terrible trainwreck of a game that falls short of any expectations one could possibly have. Bogged down by menus for the sake of menus, leveling that somehow manages to suck the life out of you, LACK OF AN AH, subsequent failure of the bazaar system, the list goes on.I almost want to rant for this game wasting my time. Why is it 100x worse than it's predecessor? Why weren't the flaws and annoyances worked out during the beta (which I took part in)? Why, why, why? I feel like I should take SE to court for defacing the Final Fantasy series and MMORPGs as a whole (though their projected profits next quarter should be punishment enough).Oh, and the 2/10 is SOLELY because FFXIV is nothing short of graphically amazing. All looks and no substance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At the present, there is little to reccomend about FFXIV. It has little to no content barring a few repeatable daily quests, and 3 mainy quest lines. It looks pretty, however pretty doesnt make the game fun. This is no FFXI, in fact compared to most MMO's its a little inadequate, the UI is slow, buggy and cumbersome, the content is severely lacking, once you hit about  rank 23-24 there are no longer any mobs, or zones you can level in. The servers lag, and the chat system is appalling, the servers are like ghost towns community wise, and the linkpearl system is getting old.That said the game has potential, but needs a year or so of content to make it worth buying, as it stands, even the most casual will get to rank 25 or so in a few weeks, and thats where the content and zones abruptly stop.Stay away for now, but come back in a year and see how the expansion makes the game play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

UI: a slow interface requiring multiple clicks to navigate wasting timeCrafting: From the first level you notice dependencies on almost every other crafting job and materials that you have to spend hours tracking down.Repair: requires exotic materials and many crafting jobs to repair your own gear, NPC is overpriced and cannot repair all your gear.Combat: Lag/no auto attack/Slow/Targeting issues (click attack and wait 2 seconds to see if you attacked).  And then the chipmunk kills you. Oh do you feel weak.  Combat became easier as I got the hang of the system and re-issued my commands over and over.  Definately understand why there's no PvP.... I feel like I write my character a postal note saying please wand attack again, then give it to a courier and /pray the courier actually gets to my character before she's gnawed to death by a fluffy critter.Lag: despite a killer connection running into a room doesn't even load static NPCs for a long time making quests difficult (am I in the right place?)Inventory: 80 slots, cannot sort, cannot "consolidate" split stacks easily, very tedious.Economy: N/A - right now if you want to buy a piece of crafted gear you either get to run around shouting all over cities and craft points or visit the retainers in the wards.  Imagine 1000 people in a room and 1 person has something useful, you need to do a lengthy/slow interaction with each one to find the item you want (if its even there)Graphics: Pretty, would be enjoyable if the rest of the experience was.Music: Could be betterQuests: wow - only can do X quests per couple days.  And they're the same repeatable ones.Plot: NPC's with screens filled with text.  Very little voice acting.  If I ever met someone who spewed 3 pages of text /wout letting me read I'd shot them, however not an option here :(Music: Music: Music: Music: Music: Music: Music: (am I getting repetitive?)Forums: They appear to be all rants.  I see almost no promising posts from SE.  I wonder if the forums are being read.As a big fan of MMO's I am really sad to score FFXIV at 2 - I can /pray it gets better, but at the moment I'm writting the expense off as a loss and canceling my account.  I had Realm First achievements in Warcraft along with 6 level 80 toons, I've played many many many MMO's including FFXI which I actually enjoyed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After navigating through the mind numbingly complex process of actually setting up your account, you get the choice of creating your character (you only get one, unless you want to pay more money, so make sure your friends are all on the same server), and watch what is a stunningly beautiful cutscene with good voice acting.  After the cut scene, however, you're basically dropped off in the city with a "good luck"  The graphics are well done, too well, perhaps,  as even some high end gaming computers will struggle with it to be even semi-smooth.  The sound has two settings, off and loud, and gets very repetitive very fast.  The user-interface is slow and horrendously designed, to change weapons you have to open the main menu, and once you find the gear section, it doesnt only bring up items that can be placed in said equipment slot, it brings up your whole inventory, so you have to scroll through and find what you want.  The main quest line, which seems interesting, has quests that are too few and far between, and it relies on a system of "levequests", of which you can only do 8 every 36 hours.  These are your standard MMO style quests, go here and kill x monsters, but leaves nothing to backstory about the world, or stories about characters, or anything.
The crafting system, which Square Enix has clearly placed a lot of emphasis on, is neat and refreshing at first, but quickly becomes exceptionally irritating.  You have to either have their players website open and alt-tab to view recipes, or write them down yourself, as the game provides no in game recipe book.  Another downside to this, is that the only way to get gear is either to buy it from someone else or craft it yourself, the emphasis being on crafting it yourself.  This can be a horribly confusing and aggrivating process, as after farming for materials for hours, you finally go to make said item, and it breaks while you are crafting it, costing you both the materials and the time you spent gathering them.  Overall, while FFXIV is a visually beautiful game, the poorly designed menus, slow and shoddy targetting system, the almos impossible to read maps, the over-emphasis on an insanely coplex crafting system, and overall lack of feeling like you are actually a part of the world make this game not only feel much more like work than a game, its an insult to the many great games of the Final Fantasy series.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game falls so extremely short on all aspects, poor gameplay, poor quests, poor dialogue, poor interface, poor environment at least the graphics and music is good.But the game is simply bad, sure graphics are nice but all the maps are like puzzles you will run past the same scenery like 15+ times, monsters are few and bugged not to mention the overall time it takes to kill one is 25-40seconds and this is your basic newbie mob. The game runs at a snail speed and it's so linear that you can't skip anything. The crafting system is decent if you care to figure it out.I thought FF13 was boring, but this simply sets a new high. I Probably never watch on a final fantasy game the same way any more. Even free asian mmorpg's can beat this crap! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A nice bonus in this game is the old arcade turtles game. Unfortunately, to unlock it you have to play the craptacular Nexus. I'm really surprised this would be aproved by both Konami and Nintendo quality assuarance. The gameplay is broken. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think we all no the reason why any gamer would buy this game....... thats right the old arcade classic.. that is only reason i would buy it ....... but until i find it on a good deal im stayin away form this game ..even the ten dollar biin onthis gmae would be too high of a price ....i my self hate to give htis game a 2 cause of the arcade classic .. if it was a review of that it be a for sure 9 or ten but thisi ..... its hurts me to say 2. for turtle fans out there... im very sorry ..once u play the gem i think u will understand ... sure the acade game si nce . but that is thonly good thing about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, where to start with the flaws or bugs in this game?
This is nothing more than the previous version, with updated names and logos, and way more flaws in the gameplay.
Here are some examples: 1.	It is basically impossible to defend the attacking cross-kick when you are defending in your 22. All the top teams use it and will score nine times out of ten as by the time you get a chance to switch to control your wing, it is too late. 2.	If you are viewing from behind (not the side) it is impossible to see what is going on when you are defending. The camera does not â

Don't play this. There is so little content on this DS cartridge that it a large money waster. Not even the biggest Sims fans will be amused. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A sheer disappointment in comparison to Double Helix.  It's generic and unpolished.  To make things even worse, the developer decided to strip away the interesting and unsettling gore systems of the last two games in favor of buckets of faking looking blood and limbs that fly off and subsequently disappear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward to this i love X men and although the Idea of the Game was good I got through the game in about 2 Hours and could not be bothered to play it again! So sad as they could have made a gr8 game :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You're better off watching the movie then playing this game that has truly horrid graphics, sluggish, unresponsive controls, and shallow fighting. Spend your money elsewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bought this today as I'm a fan of this kind of game. Have to say wish I hadn't. Very dull gameplay that involves some extremely boring mini games. Repetetive button mashing as you constantly have to smash up objects. Old mechanics of finding a key to open a door. And worst of all no online play. Didn't find it fun at all. Very average title. Can't imagine it's going to do well in the reviews. Best avoided. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything about this game on the surface seems great.  Zombies, 50's style campy horror, vastly different personas for the cartoony characters, co-op (local only mind you).  I even had a curiously good time for about the first 3 minutes.  Then I stepped in the huge steaming pile that this game is.  You are just way to busy punishing your B button blandly swinging away at furniture and harvesting wood from it to enjoy anything thats going on around you (it seems to take 10 to 20 rapid presses for each piece of furniture you destroy).  THATS 95% OF THE GAME.  It actually aggravated me more than any game I can recall in recent history.  With the atmosphere and co-op screaming "I am fun!", I wanted so much to like this game.  I thought..."Whoever was overseeing this project with such clear potential couldn't have screwed up THIS bad."  I made it to about 15 minutes before angrily powering off my 360 and shouting.  "Man, there is no getting around it, this game is just absolutely monotonous, controller breaking, unnecessary horse s h i t.!"   Unless you are 5 years old and you need to where a crash helmet to eat a bowl of cereal, you will experience buyer's remorse with this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The comic book and 3D graphics look nice, but it's really annoying to fail a level when the player tracking screws up and the game reads my moves wrong. And that happens all the time. Sometimes the game crashes, too. Too bad they charge money for this. The writing is also quite childish. Might be a fun game for kids who don't care if the game works or not and just want to jump around in their huge living room. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not be fooled; this game is utter garbage. The dungeon are designed terribly, and later dungeons are just the same as earlier ones albeit with recoloring. The story is pretty dull, and when you slog through the long game, fighting generic enemies and dealing with a bland level-up system, you fight the final boss, which is just a basic enemy. Once you beat it, he says the entire plot was basically never going to actually happen. That's right, you payed $10 to waste 5+ hours of your life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's obvious that the developers put effort into this, but it ended up not being fun at all. This review will list all of the failings I found in the first hour. My review is scathing because I feel cheated out of a few dollars, and would not have been if there were more negative reviews. For some reason the eShop ranks this game as 4 stars.

Your character has 3 stats. All 3 advance when you level up, and you get to choose how they progress to some degree. I like choices and stat management, so this sounds fun! No, this illusion of choice was ruined by the fact that only 1 stat really matters. Speed is the only stat you will need. Whenever you level up, just pick the option that increases speed the most.

Why is speed the only important stat? Because a high speed will allow you to outrun enemies on the map, and therefor avoid combat. The combat system in this game is no fun at all. You face opponents one at a time, and take turns whacking at each other. Each combat action you take will do extra damage if you press keys with proper timing. There are multiple skills and multiple weapons.

"Hey, I like item and skill management!"
Not in this game, you won't. There are no trade offs between weapons. Each is objectively better or worse than the other. Furthermore, you will only receive weapons in a specific order as you complete quests. The same is true for skills. Certain quest givers will provide you with a new weapon and skill after you have attained a high-enough character level to accept their quest. The only way weapons affect the game is in how much damage they do and the attack animation that you see. The only way skills affect the game is in how much damage they do and what button combination you need to use.

This game is all about going through dungeons to complete quests. Dungeons consist of a series of rooms connected by hallways. Hallways contain no enemies, and rooms do. Rooms also contain items that give you temporary bonuses to your stats. Your main experience in dungeon crawling will be outrunning enemies while you reach your target.

"You mean the dungeons contain items I can use? Sounds like fun!"
No, you won't be using items very much. If you are successful in outrunning enemies there will be at most 1 combat encounter per quest. After this your health will be refilled, making potions unnecessary. Using items that increase strength is pointless. The increase in damage they provide is offset by the fact that it gives the enemy an extra turn to attack. The only items I use are shields, which provide temporary defense. You could sell items in the shop, but they are worth almost nothing. The shop doesn't have useful equipment anyway, so your gold supply will continue to pile up as you play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad visuals, ludicrous story, 5.1 sound problems, repetative and boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Controls are terrible and 50 is slow as hell. Istopped playing after 10 minutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So many issues. I'm not even sure where to start. The bottom line is these issues practically make the game unplayable. Even if you can get beyond these playability issues, you won't have any fun. So odd that the first game (which was one of the early Wii games too!) is superior in every single way. No exaggeration. Honestly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Family Guy is one of the worst games of the year. The in game graphics are passable at past and the cutscenes are terrible looking. The gameplay is repetive and boring and the I didn't laugh once! The jokes are literally ripped out of previous Family Guy eps and thrown in. I haven't found on redeeming factor for this piece of **** game. I'm a huge Family Guy fan but this game just flat out blows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is no excuse for how bad this game is. Everything from the gameplay to the story (and even the soundtrack) are poorly done. Take this as an example on how not to make a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible.The graphics are disgusting, interesting storyline on paper but flawed, AI is stupid and the voice acting is pretty mediocre.Don't buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a good idea with mega-poor design and annoying linear gameplay. Lame enemies, outdated graphics and NOT FUN to shot'em (not a precise FPS, but not as enjoyable as Serious Sam). The story is interesting, but the developers kill the whole meaning of it. Overall, I wanted to turn of the game after the first chapter...very bad achievment **** very sad... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(Bottom line - try this only if you're a REALLY die-hard fan of classic point and click games, and willing to approach the game with VERY low expectations and being very forgiving towards every moment of disappointment. Also, make sure you get it on a massive sale.)

I'm sorry but this game is barely mediocre.
Being a fan of point and click adventures, and being usually forgiving towards badaverage video games, I was happy to buy the bundle which contained this game along with 5 other games, 2 of them are also a part of the Art of Murder series.
I do hope that the next games are better, because as cheap as it was, even my tolerance has its limits.

It really does sadden me to write this negative review because the basic plot actually was potentially interesting. Too bad that this, along with the average graphics, were the only good things about the game.

The presentation itself is just not good, and that ruins the entire story. Characters are extremely shallow and usually not dubbed that well, especially our protagonist which has the weird tendency to crack an unfunny joke every now and then, at the most inappropriate moments (Hey I just got fired - crack an unfunny joke - Hey someone just got killed - crack an unfunny joke).

The game itself is pretty short (luckily, because I don't know if I could stand it any longer than it already lasted), and also pretty easy, most of the puzzles are extremely obvious EXCEPT the ones which are simply too vague for you to find out what to do next. Which doesn't really feel challenging but rather Not Fun.

Still, this had somehow became a trilogy, so I really do hope that the next two games are better, because, as I had already bought them, I'm going to give them a try sometime. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Valhalla Knights 2 only promises to give fans a humongous disappointment. Most games dont live up to the hype, but Valhalla Knights 2 takes it up one more level: It completely falls short of the hype. All the problems and glitches that were in the original still persist, and the fact that the world is bigger only serves to make those problems loom even larger. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's the biggest problem in 'Japanese' action games? Absolutely bad controls. Other than NINTENDO, NAMCO and to some extent, CAPCOM (RE 5's tank control is still a mess though), many Japanese games control horribly, bad camera control or have weird design issues. Neverdead is no different. It's weird that only KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS is the only 'studio' within Konami that can make great games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Decided to give  a badly reviewed game a chance, because it's only fair. This game had a great and unique concept, however the execution and game play didn't fit it. I've only played a couple of hours of this game and had it. The concept of ripping body parts out, destructible environments, butterfly blade sounds sweet but it aint. It's true it's more annoying than cool when you get split into pieces and have to either wait or find your body parts; and it's ironic when the rolling head says "motion sickness", because that's what i got watching the head roll around. The enemies were so reptitive and annoying as hell to fight especially the portal which spits them out. The Swordpig looks like a 4th grader drew it, (and not even a good one). I tried to like this game, but it looks as if the game developers didn't put their best resources into this game. Imagine if they could've had MG revengeance's sword system with the butterfly knife and not the awkward "no neck"  and have to turn the whole camera around to do a 180 just to kill something. BORING. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was trying to be the challenger to Oblivion, but that"s like if a 7 year old tried to beat Mohamed Ali on the ring, it's not a fight but a massacre if you want to compare both games, but even when judging the game on its own, it"s terrible, let's see why.

Technically despite some average graphics for the time, the framerate is horrible (and don't expect any patch 10 years later), as soon as you move it drops significantly which is already a pain in the ass  and can stop you from playing the game.

Concerning the gameplay the fighting is boring as hell and don't work great, but the other RPG mechanics are okay, the only good point of the game. The map is pretty big but also empty so you'll just walk most of the time. Once again hard to take any joy from playing.

Finally the story is a basic fantasy story played by some of the worst actors I've ever heard in my life, honestly go watch some youtube videos they're so bad it's funny. If despite all this flaws you want to finish the game it will length at least 30 hours which is good for a RPG, but ends up way too long for this game.

In conclusion this is probably the worst game I've played in my life, it's a pain to play, to watch and to listen, Even if you love RPG there's a lot of other options out there before you can even think to try this garbage, I read the second episode is way better, I guess I'll see, but this one is definitively bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I was playing this, I thought, "Wow, this would've been an awesome game if it had been released about 5 years ago on PC/Xbox." Graphics are poor, but that's not a huge concern compared to the other flaws. The interface reminds me of Diablo. As such, it is much better suited for a mouse. Trying to organize your inventory or boost a particular spell takes a long time, as you must awkwardly try to use the analog stick to select an object and, once you've found it, try to remember which button uses it and which button drops it. Malee combat is lame. I had a single combat animation that was promoted by tapping RT. Depending on the elevation difference between you and your enemy, 1/3rd to 1/2 of your attacks might hit. Magic is a bit more interesting to use, but not by much. The worst part in this panoply of failures is the voice acting. Yes, I know you're a small studio, but seriously, this game has the worst voice acting I've ever heard. Also, the subtitles often end in question marks even when the characters aren't asking questions. I tried to get into this game. I really did. However, the horrible voice acting and pointless combat mechanics forced me to send it back to the good folks at Gamefly. Note: I played this game right after finishing Bioshock, so maybe I got spoiled by quality. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When two worlds was first announced it promised alot, it was even thought of as the game that could beat oblivion, however that is very much not the case. The graphics leave alot to be desired, the missions are all the same, just run from A to B and kill someone or find an item then run back for your reward. The voice overs and dialog are just apauling. If your looking for an epic RPG experiance then Two Worlds is not for you, If you must own an RPG for your 360 console then Choose Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion if you have not already done so. I am just glad that i only rented this game and did not waste £39.99 on this utter piece of crap that does not deserve anyones attention. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. It is like a strung out wannabe version of Oblivion. Graphics look early x-box quality at best. The programing stinks, lock ups, slow downs etc. The voice overs are garbage, hard to listen too without puking. Very disapointing To sum this game up its total crap...avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never played a worse game in my entire life and I am a huge fan of Oblivion, RPG's and MMO's. The framerate is a consistent 10-15fps, the textures lack detail, the controls are stiff and jerky and the NPC interactions are out of a PS1 game. These people giving this game good reviews must have the lowest video game standards that I have ever seen. I wouldn't take this game if someone wanted to give it to me for free neverless pay $60 for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a huge Oblivion fan, and I had heard this game was like it. So I rented it to try it out. Ugh... This game is absolutely terrible. Yes I see its resemblences to Oblivion, but unlike that game, everything is broken. The menus are actually headache inducing! Literally, I got a headache trying to get through them. The combat is absolutely laughable, with clunky animations and no depth. The story, no idea, couldn't stand the game so I didn't get into the story. It's probably bad though. The only cool thing about this game is its graphics. Yes it has a lot of pop-in and bugs but the world is suprisingly not that bad. The enviroments, at times, can be very pretty. If you are looking for a great open-world RPG stick with Oblivion or Fallout 3, this game is not worth your time. You should check out the innovations column on the official Two Worlds website..hilarious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game's frame rate/A.I./menues/animations are all broken. Horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When i heard about two worlds, i had to admit, it sounded awesome. I thought maybe it would be even better than Oblivion... boy was i wrong. From the demo i could tell that the fighting was terrible, the graphics lacking and much much more. Do NOT buy thig game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics and interface disappointed and irritated me beyond all hope of enjoying this game. I played it for 5 minutes and placed it back in the case in utter disdain. The sour feeling in the pit of my stomach furthered when I remembered I spent 60 dollars on the trash. Ouch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has promise, but the promises are unfulfilled. The game is almost unplayable, broken beyond repair, and the voice acting is laughable. Save your money. You won't regret not buying this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i hate the need for speed nitro style on wii, they should bring to us a new
need for speed with the old need for speed carbon style (the best need for speed for wii (from 2006...)). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I saw the trailer of the game I thought: "Wow, another great racing game with great graphics", but I was wrong. The graphics suck; this game would have been a disappointment even for PS1 owners. After ten seconds of play I shut my Wii down. Even if this game would have an excellent control system, nobody is going to experience it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you want a playable game, avoid it at all costs.
This game is Published by one of the worst Publishers around, named Headup Games.
Headup games has delivered different titles who are all underrated by their costumers.
This game brings that back again, The controls are horrible, the save system is strange and feels bad.
Also the voiceacting is nothing special. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

very bad control and navigation system. its very hard to play this game and the control make it not fun to play it. the graphics is okey. for the story i didnt continue playing since i was frostrated 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game hoping the reviews were just people who liked newer type games and couldn't handle the slow pace of a strategical game. I bought this game for me and a friend since I don't like playing many games in single player, especially if there is an option for multiple players. I had played a bit of the game before my friend and I played and then we connected and tried playing coop. This was one of the worst experiences I've had in a multiplayer game. In order to play a level coop you MUST first have played that level in single player. You choose your players then you choose your level, you play the level and it's done. There is no level progression with multiplayer. This game was poor planning, poor execution. The only thing they did good on was making it look good so that it would sell. After that they continually drop the ball for every other gaming aspect. This game had potential to be great and I'm sad to say they missed the mark by a long shot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is TERRIBLE! I love zombie games but this one is awful. Yes it has zombies, but Trapped Dead also has poor control, bad story, unlikeable characters, and a save system I hate. Project Zomboid (not available on Steam) is exponentially better than this stinking pile of software. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Juego mediocre y decepcionante. si bien el Ford Racing 3 no era perfecto si tenia ciertas cosas que se podrían disfrutar. un buen numero de vehículos, pistas y retos. acá todo disminuye y todo baja. un juego de verdad nada recomendable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty much sucks. Read teh bottom three reveiws and you get a true idea og what the game is about. No million dollar prize that was canceled after the first three weeks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My computer blows away the RECOMMENDED requirements, every thing on land is smooth, but when controlling boats, they are choppy and off course. Also the corny dialogue sort of put over the edge for rating this game lower than 4, gay phrases like "Oh gawd! I think that's a leviathan on the horizon", Its not just once, also, its every second time you move the f*%*%** characters. I loved EE2, It was my favorite because of the vast majority of epochs, classes, units, and realism, but now, I'm not sure if EE3 is a kids game because of the cartoonish looks, or a teen game because of the violence and slight complexity of the game play. What a horrible piece of crap, use your money to get something good, Like Empire earth 2 or Empire Total War. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The launch content is woefully inadequate as you can finish the content in about a day of play, combine that with a swag of bugs, an endless list of missing/promised features that were supposed to be the games selling point and the fact it is just another fantasy MMO (but done badly), this game was highly disappointing, maybe in 6 months after they implement the rest of the game (if it lives that long) it might be worth a try, right now it is just a waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This title doesn't include enough content at launch to justify its cost. I expect more than a week's worth of activities from a modern subscription-based MMO, especially one at this price point. While the content was reasonably engaging along the way, there was just absolutely nothing for my character to do one it reached the maximum level of 30. This took me less than 24 hours of actual game-play time. There's a lot of room for improvement here, and if the game hadn't been released so prematurely with so many crashes and bugs, my opinion would likely have been better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The credits almost seem longer than the DLC itself, and the time it took to download the DLC is definitely longer than the amount of game play. I have been looking forward to this DLC since I beat the game and I am extremely let down. My jaw dropped when i reached the end of the DLC campaign, not because it was such a spectacular ending, but because i didn't believe it was over so quick. I played for only about an hour and it was all over. The story starts off strong and takes place where the original game left off, but doesn't carry on much more after that. There are no new guns, mods, or weapon parts included with the DLC as they can all be acquired in the original game. There aren't any new suits or special unlocks at all. The only new things in this add on are a few text logs, and maybe 3 or 4 new enemies at most. Even the places you go are exactly the same as the original game with a few touch ups done. If this DLC was priced at 5 dollars it may be worth it but 10 is far too steep for such a shallow expansion. You won't be missing much if you skip this DLC and i recommend just watching the game play on the Internet instead of wasting your money on it. Visceral and EA really pulled the wool over our eyes on this one and made it sound greater than it would be. Hopefully they will make up for it in the future with a lengthier DLC and new content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You shouldn't be surprised at being short changed with a 1 hour DLC. Look at the main game and ask yourself how lazy the developers were in adopting the cookie cutter approach to rooms corridors etc. I don't know how many times I had to stop and check that I wasn't revisiting the same places. They were also lazy with spelling (Personell, Ordinance) so a cheap fix DLC is not a shock. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok.Ok.Ok. I gave this game a new chance. But`s even more terrible than before. It just doesn`t work. You can see the developers tried an therefore i don`t give it a total zero. Please hire someone who knows things about dramatization (theater or film) Someone who knows how to tell a storyline. Sound and voice are just...........o man......so bad. I`ve  tried to like this game (I did) But the only way to like it is to go back to a commodore64 for the next decade and then play this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game doesn't look bad. But animation is a joke, voice acting is horrible, fighting is bad, oponents are retarded, and cut scenes are making you laugh .. how somebody could give this 9 or 10 is beyond me, probably producers themselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was unable to push past around two hours with this game, despite a promising beginning with excellent art direction, seemingly depicting a survival shelter designed during the fashionable sixties or seventies, reminiscent of old TV series like Space 1999, or Blake 7.

Unfortunately the English voice-acting is agonisingly poor, and in places illegible without subtitles due to poor quality recordings combined with overbearing background music.

Visuals are adequate, even pretty in places, including that rarity in action-horror - dark rooms are actually dark! Animations, particularly facial animations are extremely stilted and out of date, however.

The combat is the heart of the game, given that even two hours in there seems to be rather a lot of it, and this is what murders the experience for me - fights are simple exchanges of 'block' 'strike', 'block' 'strike' repeated until the enemy turns into a sluggish ragdoll with a snarl or a groan. Repeat ad nauseum. Firearms combat appears to do nothing to alter AI, and merely drills off enemy HP until they either slump, or experience a gory limb removal.

Default movement is a very slow, floating jog, giving the protagonist a manner both camp/effete and slightly creepy. You can slow this down further with a walk button, held constantly rather than toggled, but the walk is a sort of sleepy, unconcerned saunter more suited to a summer evening than a living nightmare. Beyond that is yet another reiteration of the Gears of War sprint, blurring and shaking as you hurl yourself like a charging bull into walls, using the local geometry to steer. Lacking any real physics implementation, you'll simply slide off the richly detailed but utterly static environmental clutter, and your stamina for combat and running will inexplicably recharge within half a second, almost rendering it irrelevant.

What can be said... Some opportunist took a promising indie game and turned it into a low-budget Polish Dead Space with poor localisation and crude features - and I'm talking about the updated version with 'significantly enhanced combat' here - I can't imagine how bad the original must have been.

A tragic waste, an overwhelmingly boring, formulaic copy-cat of a game, that fails to copy the best parts of its predecessors while slavishly mimicking the use of picked up notes (all irrelevant and boring), clunky third person melee combat and bland shooting. Cargo cult game design at its finest.

Play something else, but hope these developers get to use their skills on a better directed project one-day. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. Don't buy it, even hardcore Spyro fans such as myself will find it unbelievably boring and uninspiring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you take a look at the user reviews that have given this game a 9 or 10, almost all of them are brand new accounts with only one review to their name. Obviously the developers marking up their own game. Not only does this game suck, but so do the developers for their dishonesty and manipulation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game goes beyond the barriers of terrible and into the depths of abysmal. The camera angles are horrible, the controls are weak and sluggish, and there is some semblance of something that is plot. It's hack and slash at its worst. avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Uh, i couldn't even figure out how to get out of the first level. Arg! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No story, loading takes too much time (that could be my pc but it's an old game, right?) and after a time it gets boring, you get to learn that each and every time you finish something that is on your 'to-do' list, some bad guys will show up and then bam bam bam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is like Quake 3 in graphics and if it came out two to 3 years ago that would be fine. It uses the Unreal 2 engine but not to great effect. Yes, it's graphic and its a bastard son of the GTA games except theres nothing to drive. People have said alot about the load times and yes it takes under 60 sec to load however sometimes you have to go through 6 or 7 zones in a mission and take away from the action. It's low brow and crude and some like that however the lack of humor other than immature and child like pee pee and cha cha jokes. Skins are ok but every woman has the same body and the damage system is very much lacking. Shoot someone in the leg or head the seem to take the same amount of damage. This game is for the crowd that either never gets it (you know what I mean) or hasn't had it in a long time. It's all tease but the tease is flawed by dated graphics, repetive load times and trying to rip off GTA games but with the class. Nothing is really funny other than RWS trying to be funny. Not a good game and theres other games that really need to be played. Like XXX BMX its all show no go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Postal 2, it's like a joke that starts off funny, but then you hear it so many times and you just want it to fry! That's exactly what the relationship between the first two were. What's the difference? It never was funny to start off with. That's how terrible Postal 2 is... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is this getting so many positive reviews? This game is just an awful, pointless waste of time. Never before have I been so quickly repelled by a game. There are literally no redeeming features - The graphics are poor, the AI is poor, there seems to be no solid plot to the game, and its whole attempt at attracting players revolves around the fact that you can dismember and urinate on the characters. You can also relieve yourself in someone's mouth until they puke.

It's just absolute trash. I'm glad I didn't buy it: it was gifted to me by a friend who had bought a four pack. No one else wanted the other two copies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First I have not played the original but this remake I'm sure doesn't do it justice. It feels like a budget rip off of shadow complex. The gameplay and platforming is boring and the voice acting SUCKS! This is the worse game of summer of arcade. Save your money for any of the other titles like brothers and tmnt out of the shadows unless you want to play a boring platformer with no new ideas. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Discount machinarium.
Amanita Design wannabe.

Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game fails in everything!!! I highly recommend NOT buying this game... This isn't even 10 bucks worth for a 4 hours campaign full of pain... Worst shooter ever so far! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has a lot of promise, but falls short on a couple of issues. It's awfully repetitive and the worst voice acting I've ever heard. But you just might enjoy the Diablo-in-a-future-setting gameplay... for a while. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In short, this game is one of the most over-hyped horror games I have ever seen.  Simply cashing in on the recent influx of horror type games, Daylight offers little to no creativity and is simply a remake of every jumpscare game with slightly better graphics.

For a full description, Daylight approaches the horror genre with a boring and simple gameplay mechanic of find the pages, get the doll, go to the exit.  That is literally the full extent of its gameplay, nothing more, that's IT.  No creative puzzles, no clever tricks, extremely repetitive gameplay, and almost zero interaction besides opening doors and picking up notes.  And every level, asides from being 'procedurally generated', is a bland barrage of greys and blacks.

Next, the horror aspect of this game is almost nothing to people who have either played horror games in the past or are older than the age of 17, which is how old you have to be to play the game IN THE FIRST PLACE, but we'll get to that later.  Aside from occasionally causing you to stir by one or two jumpscares, the game is nothing but an endless assault of unoriginal and unimaginative jumpscares, one after the other, again and again.  After a while, I was literally calling out when stuff would happen well before the actual event.  The ghosts that chase you aren't at all scary or creepy, they're just girls with lights in their eyes and mouth.  Also, what was possibly the scariest part of this game is the thought that other people are actually scared by pathetic attempts such as this.

Before you complain that "Slender has the exact same gameplay and horror aspect and it's sooooo popular!", Slender has a reason for being exactly that.  It was a mod developed by a handful of people and was released to the public for free.  This game was developed by a full team in a big company with plenty of funding to make something worthwhile.  This is not.

Furthermore, the story in this game is almost nonexistent, being nothing but a bunch of notes that you probably don't even read that vaguely detail what happened over a century ago.  I've seen better story-lines from games such as Killing Floor and Sniper Elite: NZA.  Also, why they have Andrew Ryan from Bioshock as the only other human in this game is beyond me.

As for the M rating on the game, the only thing that could POSSIBLY warrant that rating is the occasional references to suicide and the unneeded language.  If not for those, this game would easily have an E rating where it actually might scare the potential audience.  Although, my 14 year old brother would laugh if he played this game.

The only thing that keeps this game afloat is the good PR given to it by big YouTubers such as Markiplier and Pewdiepie, and the only reason for this is because of the unique feature in the game (yes, there actually is SOMETHING special in this game) where you can livestream via Twitch and have the viewers affect the gameplay by their comments.  That being said, this game is only good for a very limited crowd, and would honestly be a better game if it was sold by Twitch to only be played on Twitch.

In summary, this game is a pathetic attempt to scare a mature audience and only succeeds in scaring those who either are scared by their own shadow or those who are too young to play the game in the first place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unspeakably bad. Repetitive, a total failure of gameplay, misuse of procedural generation, dull, tedious, not scary, horrible story, bad mechanics, nothing here works correctly. It has some nice graphics for the first half an hour until you realize that yes, you are just going to be seeing the same rooms over and over again at which point they become as tedious as everything else. There is not a price for which you should buy this game. At 99% off, this would still be a skip. It is a waste of the time and money of all parties involved. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not even the advanced graphics of the Nvidia workshop can save this dreadful clone of every other horror game that is plaguing the gaming world right now. Not even worth it for free. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

damn, the game is freaking boring, i almost killed myself while i was playing....every scene is just the same not to mention that poorly ''witch'' and her annoying scream that makes the whole game even more boring.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Got this for free with my video card. I was able to give it about an hour, after that I couldn't take it anymore. Boring and pointless; I have way too many other games in my steam library before I waste my time with this. Glad I didn't pay anything for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucked in every way. It was a complete waste of time and money. Can you tell me why their faces were green? It's glitchy and the worst game I've ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of setting low goals, then constantly failing to meet them. Hockey puck, anyone? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst game i ever played has about a thousand glitches. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even as a huge fan is the Serious Sam series, I just can't stomach this poor effort of a game, with it's horrible graphics(Even for the a GBA game with DOOM-like graphics), music that sounds like it was made on the original GameBoy's sound chip, and frustrating controls, you should seriously skip on Serious Sam Advance and get one of the PC games instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not hot, any title where the button mashing mini-games are so tiresome you want to give up, can't be that good. The graphics are great, but one has to wonder did the testers even play this game for more then 10 Mins? I Found no enjoyment in this game. The missions or "Quests" are broken up into such small segments that you don't feel like you are playing anything epic. I was really disappointed that I bought this game, and I only paied 19.95 for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An unworthy successor of a great game, only confirming what we already know: Modern tycoon/simulation games are generally becoming more and more unoriginal, boring and a total waste of good gamers money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be one of the worst games I've ever played. I was sadly disappointed. Theme Hospital was awesome, but this wasn't an upgrade at all. I'd rather play Theme Hospital than this game. The thing that annoyed me most was that the camera angle was terrible, and no matter how much I tried to change it, I felt like I didn't get  a good overview at all. Very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely bad game. Especially story, and gameplay...and setting...Shooting in that game is terrible. Paintball rifle have bigger recoil than guns in that game. It's have not got normal story. It's not interesting to play.I am big fan of the first two parts of "Call of Juarez", but "The Cartel" is VERY BIG UPSET. Where is incredible landscapes of wild west? Where is prairies and two cowboys?  Where is Sheriff shooting ElBanditos? Spurs, whisky?The game I loved died July 22. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The biggest problem with this additional content is its brevity. Within an hour you will be finished, and wondering, "Ok, what next?". There is no humor to the storyline or dialogue, and the addition of a polygonal Tera Patrick (who looks like she was beaten with the digital ugly stick) seems pointless. Wish I could give bad DLC back to Volition, beating it first with the "bad deal" stick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

yargh. File this under the category of hack game based on a great movie. If you played this and haven't seen the movie, DO NOT take this game as a fair reperesentation of the movie at all. This simply blows and the movie is amazing. I don't know why I bothered playing all the way through, I hated this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game for about an hour and already lost interest. The objectives aren't very challenging, but they also aren't very clear. It would be good to just kill some time as a poor puzzle game if the cut scenes didn't make me cringe because the do the film such a disservice. See the film, it's great, skip the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think this game looks terrible.. I mean the wii has more power than the game shows.. it like it is a lack of interest from the developers, cause you check other driving games at least have reflections, dirt has really poor graphics.. even need for speed carbon looks better, if wii has more power than a ps2 at least it should look like gran turismo, I mean just check dirt2 on ps3.. dirt2 on wii and other consoles look like if they were diferent games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best part of this entire game is easily the multiplayer mini-games. The story line is so watered down that even die-hard harry potter fans will wonder what they are doing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The spell casting is fun, if the same as the previous games, but the rest of the game play is abysmal. The majority of the game is running around dozens of acres of campus in real time which is made tedious enough, but then add in a camera that freaks out regularly and doors that sometimes can not be seen from the only angle you're allowed and it becomes truly maddening. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe the worst HP game ever made.... :(. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved Monkey Ball 1 and 2 (and Deluxe) but this thing is gawd awful. First: The puzzle mode is 1-player only. No more sitting with friends playing the puzzle mode. Second: Loading screen! For example, in Monkey Target, you must wait almost a full minute to load the screen... and that is between each attempt--and you are playing on the exact same level each time. What is it loading?! The puzzles are tough--very tough, and about all that is worth spending any time on. Oh, and Monkey Race has a grand total of 3 courses! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Though a Bionicle fan, my 6 year old became disinterested with this game in a few hours. Poor graphics, monotonous imagery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was kind of looking forward to this but I wish I hadn't been. The games camera makes it damn near unplayable a leads to frustration, something I rarely ever do with a game. Do not waste your money on this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't even understand why they would make this game , its extremely boring and the camera is horrible
I actually not have to say anything more so this is where this reviews stops , because i stopped playing the game as fast as I wrote this review. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"This'll be interesting." was my first thought when putting the disc into the drive of my Xbox. This proved to be very true, although not in the way I had expected it to be. Duke Nukem Forever is a game that captures very much the essence of Duke Nukem 3D, it is indeed the same Duke we're about to meet. You really don't need more than a few minutes into the intro to realize this. Paying homage to the original is however nothing you can build an entire game on, and being true to the earlier games is the only thing that is done properly within Duke Nukem Forever. Everything else pretty much sucks. Animations are poorly made and implemented with characters displaying snapping and odd movement patterns. You play in first person view yet there is a ton of bugs related to this. Notice especially how the player seems to hover about a feet above the floor and how it's possible to trigger strafing movement without triggering the strafing animation. Facial animations are so poorly implemented that they seem to have no correlation at all with the content of their audio files. The sound is poor as well, with no considerable variations implemented at all. This makes the game sound repetitive and uninteresting. Just try to jump a few times in a row and listen to the grunting Duke lets out as he lands and you'll understand what I mean. The whole game sounds pretty much like this, apart from the few areas that have for some reason been left totally without any ambience tracks making them feel even more out of place and breaking immersion totally. Considering the competing titles Duke Nukem Forever has nothing to show when it comes to visuals either, it simply looks worse than the titles it's supposed to outrun. I've always thought that the most important thing to pull off when doing a game is the gameplay and since this game doesn't even manage that it's not worth anyones time really. There are huge sections with non-existing gameplay and nothing for the player to do while waiting for some pointless movie (with sucky facials and poor sound) to finish. If you want something that feels like the old Duke Nukem 3D but is a bit new and has boobs that you haven't seen before just replay the old game with some downloaded porno in the background, it's pretty much the same thing. And whatever you do, don't buy this game first hand, there's bound to be a huge second hand market for it within short. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game simply put horrible.  the texture and animation feel horrid. the gameplay didn't wow me eihter.shooting aliens gets boring after a while. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Un juego totalmente desfasado, en chistes, gráficos y jugabilidad. Uno de los juegos mas malos en todo el catálogo de PS3. Podría haber sido un juego para pasar un buen rato y ya, pero ni eso. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was absolute crap. If this were 2003, then this might have been okay, but it is not. The jokes were cheesy, the graphics sucked, and the developers spent way too much time to make the game crude and violent, and not enough making it good. It was a terrible dissapointment for a game that had so much pre-release hype. The only reason I give it the 2 is because it is clear that the game had potential, but they messed it up... a lot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved this game when it was 3rd person and fun.

This on the other hand is simply unplayable.
Luckily there is a demo but I would strongly recommend steering clear.
Even the demo manages to annoy you.

Pivotal, what are you doing...Go back to the roots of the series, it's a huge shame to see this franchise fall this badly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A waste of time and money. I have managed on occasion to get the game running but usually once I get the stupid screen that advises me that a game-pad is best - nothing! I don't use a game pad and I have a new top-range computer with2Gb DDR2 memory, an 8600 graphics card 256Mb GDDR3 ram, and this useless game doesn't work. As far as the game is concerned, the amateur programmers should look for work more in line with their abilities. I am sure there must be a number of janatorial vacancies around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Chivalry is a game that I kept hearing so much about because of its PC release and you know what, I really loved the idea. It looked fun, visceral, and very satisfying and it also is a fresh take on the competitive multiplayer genre. I wanted to play this but I never realized there was a 360 port until recently, I had already got the Xbox One so I decided to wait until that eventual release. Well, it is here! AAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaand...it absolutely sucks. Now, here is the thing, the PC version looks awesome, it does and I have no doubts that it is fun beyond belief, but here...well, it is abysmal.

Activision has the publishing reigns on the console versions and that right there is a huge red flag, but it is clear that the console ports were made by a team that clearly does not care about Torn Banner's original creation. Torn Banner had nothing to do with these ports as far as I know. This version is so bad, that it is now the first ever Xbox One digital title that I have had fully refunded by Microsoft. Yeah, I was able to get a full refund on this title because of how terrible it is. Let's go down the list really quick.

The Xbox One version:

* Looks like an Xbox 360 launch title from 2005
* Has horrendous hit detection
* Lag issues abound
* Feels floaty and unresponsive
* And to top all of this madness off, it runs at an unstable 30fps while the PS4 runs at 60fps, all despite that the game looks like absolute garbage

And there is my reasoning. If you own an Xbox One and really want this game, I highly recommend that you avoid it at all costs. And this is a damn shame too, I want to play and love this game, but this port is a cheap exploitation and it does not deserve our money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad graphics, bad level design, bad controls...  Just a really bad game altogether.  Too bad, because "Wall-E" was a brilliant movie that desereved a much better game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game stinks compared to the other Twisted Metal games!! I prefer nice big graphics, not little Gameboy graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is so awsome. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Daikatana quality. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A chock-full of cliches, crap, poor animation, silly story, bad camera, poor voice acting... you name it, it's there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is abysmal. After the (admitted awesomeness) that is hitting people with household objects wears off, you are left with nothing more than an advertisement for the Insane Clown Posse. It has to be said that any game that can somehow make beating down on the horrorcore group with a 2x4 a tedious experience should be avoided like the plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know what those two are thinking, but this game was awful. The camera is probably the biggest problem. Not unlike Terminator: Dawn of Fate (another piece of shit you shouldn't buy), you don't even see what you're shooting at most of the time. The graphics were pretty good, but the piss-poor gameplay really kills the whole game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rubbish. Absolute rubbish. I was completely dissapointed from many points of view. Jokes were constantly being reused, the gameplay is just aweful, and the graphics had the potential to be good, but they were bland. The only real good thing about it was the voice acting. I'm not a Family Guy hater since I completely loved the first 3 seasons, but this game is just aweful, and the sad this is that Family Guy drones will buy it simply because it is about Family Guy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the deal, Stolen is a sham of a game though some concepts are somewhat intriging this game is no different than a trend game simply put out to make a select few some money to invest into hopefully a better game. Don't get me wrong I love stealth games the harder the better but there is always a fine line between unrealistic and fun. Obviously you don't want a game to be so unrealistic that the fun factor is non existent and you dont want a game to be so realistic it is no longer fun. This is one of those games. There is no way to kill guards, fine, 0 body count but then why not knock them out for any significant amount of time. This game would be awesome 5 years ago but after the dominence of the MGS Machine this game with lack of a better discription is toilet paper but not the soft fluffy kind but the kind hospitals have that is like sand paper. This is a bad game. Give the makers credit though they have to put there name on it and it will be burned into a long list of failures when they try to find a better job in another gaming company and the employer will look at that long piece of garbage resume and come to this game, then they will quietly remove you from the office and burn the thought that this game ever existed out of there memory. For all the unfortunates like myself who purchased this game in hopes of a fun, and enjoyable experience, please smash this game and burn it in hopes that it does not fall into the hands of any other person hoping for a good game. For the good of the planet. To the creators of this game, please don't quit your day job, you'll do much better at Burger King anyways and do us all a favour put any remaining copies in the deep fryer for about say ...6 months. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The concept itself may have been exciting at the time, and thats the only good thing that I can say about this game. The controls leave a lot to be desired. No effort was put into the story and writing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Eat Lead is easily described by one word: suckish. It is a funny game yes with an interesting story to it, but it sacrifices everything else for the comedy. The gameplay feels very recycled from other games but the company actually ruined it here. It is also extremely repetive, fighting the same enemies over and over, and there are plenty of times where enemies will randomly spawn right behind you. Barely any weapons, pathetic boss battles, and well, everything about this game is pretty bad. You know how the boxart has Matt holding a chain-gun in one hand and a pissed off machine gun in the other? Guess what, you do not even get those weapons. The most explosive weapon that you get is a wimpy looking grenade launcher. Trust me, I would only suggest this as a rental only for the trophies. Nothing else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad graphics, dull gameplay, and boring story 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

- In it's current state it's borderline unplayable without a controller. (maybe it's unplayable with a controller also, who knows)
- Bored to death with the story

The only positive thing I can bring up is that the soundtrack is composed by Inon Zur, but you can listen to that on youtube, so don't bother with this game, it's not worth your time or money....

Oh and btw, nice going with Denuvo(TM), I'm  a 100% sure that the money you spent on delaying the crack for 3 days could not have went anywhere better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Curiosity got me into this game. The heroine is incredibly attractive. And that's where it ended for me. Buggy. Nonsensical object finding. Terrible automatic game save feature that does not permit loading an earlier  game when the game malfunctioned on a bug that did not permit proceeding nor loading and earlier save. For goodness sakes. What? Silly characters. Childish story line. Absolutely  gut churning frustration with mouse-keyboard controls and 3rd person graphics. Slow movement. Washed out shading. It came off my pc really fast after I got stuck by the bug. Awful and I have been a gamer since 1988... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How to mess a good idea would be how i see Neverdead. The voice acting is horrible, the gameplay is so random that it makes it feels ''hardcore '' to some but it is just testing your patience really. Frustration is common ground with this game, glitch in graphics is even more common. Save your bucks, and wait for others games...this one should be Everdead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good idea done terribly.

The gameplay in NeverDead is good hack and slash with terrible shooting.The level design is creative too.

The game is filled with glitches and bugs on top of that.

Graphics are ugly,but the framerate is solid.

Sound design and soundtrack suck too.Game also only lasts 5 hours on hardest difficulty,so probably about 2 on easy.

In short............ DO NOT BUY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oddly, I was sent a rental copy of the game before it was officially released in the shops, and with no reviews in any magazines / online.. and the second you load the game you can see why no review copies were sent out to magazines...awful is the only word I can really use to describe the game, it has no flow, it's clunky, the graphics are awful, you only need to bash one button through out the game, the sound is terrible, sounds like it's mono.Terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Complete and utter garbage. No Sprint, one useless dribble move, no jab steps, no pump fakes, no dynasty mode, awkward controls. Overall, this game is a waste of time to even bother playing, as it is impossible to enjoy. The controls are terrible. Half the time the game will not register your movements at all, and when it does, it will often register the wrong movement, so you will throw up an ugly looking layup attempt from beyond the three point line. The ONE dribble move you can use in the game is an ineffectual crossover, which is supposedly performed using the nunchuk. However, the game rarely registers your movement, and even when it does, the crossover never frees up a player. Shooting is not intuitive at all. In order to shoot, you must flick up and then down, and the process feels nothing like an actual shot. No turbo means that even with 5 seconds left in a quarter, you must jog up the court and then hope the game registers your shot movement. No dynasty mode makes it all that much worse, as all the fun of being a GM is gone, which would have been this game's only chance of being enjoyable. The most irritating thing is the fact that the computer can and does use spin moves, pump fakes, ball fakes, and jab steps quite regularly. Also, there is absolutely no defence against a dunker at all, but a Dirk Nowitzki fade away gets blocked regularly by players much smaller and less athletic. At harder difficulties, it is impossible to stop a shot, as the CPU almost always makes every shot. It is as if EA thought "how can we drive the most people to the Xbox".
Don't buy this game, you will find yourself regretting it, and it even may make you wish you hadn't bought a Wii. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They had a great model to base this product on, but they tried to reinvent the wheel and ended up with a brick. Not only did they not improve on some obvious deficiencies in wii sport, but it seems like they took what was good from it and did away with that as well. You can get used to the timing between your approach and the character being off, but I can't tell if anything I do with the wii remote does anything to affect the game play. Game play is boring and slow. I was playing wii sport within an hour of getting home with this game. I've even read some reviews here and decided to give it a second try...same result. SAVE YOURSELF $40.00 go buy yourself a pizza and a DVD (at least that way you will get a guaranteed 2 hours of entertainment). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics, fine. Story, interesting. Controls/Camera? THE WORST EVER. They are the most frustrating controls. If you tap the analog stick she practically jumps forward! I'm glad they at least have the save-whenever-option. psh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The graphics and the soundtrack are about all that would be worthy of keeping if you were to strip this game down and toss out the fat. The controls are so bad that I returned the game a day after I bought it and felt happy to at least not be wasting any more of my time. Somebody else said Eidos/Core buried this series, I am SO in agreement here. Congrats to them, Tomb Raider is dead to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have read nearly all the reviews across many sites, I have seen it with my own eyes, and I have heard all the negative feedback. This is a travesty to all the game players waiting for so long only to be confronted with an inferior product. I just want to know one thing has, or is EIDOS/CORE going to make a statement to their customers, if this was any other product there would be a recall solely on poor performance. It is a shame that such a popular game was not only delayed in its release but the expectations on AOD have not sufficed in the slightest. What a disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some people truly deserve to be fired for this monstrosity. The controls are so frustrating. The gameplay is moronic, and the graphics aren't even very good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are nice for the ps2 but slow the system down in certian areas, this should have been dealt with in production. As for the controls...BAH! Absolutely the worst controls Ive ever experienced in gaming. Who are these people who are actually given jobs to work for such a big title and blunder so badly? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game not counting Tomb Raider 2013 was Lara's most ambitious game ever. but just like Sonic the hedgehogs first leap onto the next generation of consoles (Sonic 06), it did not pay of as it almost killed the franchise. The story is not as amazing as other people make it out to be. Lara is nasty to everyone she talks to, even when they are trying to help her. The story is predictable.The plot of the game involves Lara needing to find out if she killed her mentor or not. Well of course she didn't. It is very predictable from the very beginning. The game looks great for an early PS2 title though, and it even puts more detail into character animations and environments than games later in the series. and the soundtrack is absolutely incredible. one of my favorite video game soundtracks of all time.

The gameplay  though is absolutely horrendous. Lara's control is really awkward and horrid. The game is littered with bugs and the stealth mechanic, while it works surprisingly, is absolutely useless due to the games hilariously bad enemy AI, some examples of how stupid they are include, running into walls, running in the opposite direction of Lara, and not doing anything even when Lara is standing right in front of them. And I will also add that there is only one tomb in the entire game, yeah, only one tomb, the rest of the game takes place in Paris.

Overall a horrible game that almost killed the series. Thankfully Crystal Dynamics took over as they have created in my opinion the three best games in the franchise, Tomb raider Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld. You Should not waste your time with this disaster. Play the other games in the series, they are all better video games. (Well....... except Tomb Raider III) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Look man. i really tried. maybe 3-4 hours. but really tried. tried shoot someone and get checkpoints. tried rescue some guys. but i cant take this. its really bad game. if you ask my advice dont play this game. you love ww2 game or not dont play this game. play call of duty 1 or 2 even better. sorry my bad english. see you :) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A big dissapointement with this title, I really hoped for great WW2 shooter but what I got is a low budget WW2 shooter that brings nothing interesting with it. This game should be sold as digital download for 15$ because what it offers for current price is a joke.

+WW2 (Not many games set in ww2 out there)
+Graphics (Cryengine did it's job)
+Maps size

-Bugs (First 5-10 minutes of game and I have already seen 3 or 4 bugs and yes some are really annoying)

-Combat system, it seems to be literally broken, most of the time it takes one bullet to kill enemy when sometimes you have to waste 10 or more bullets on him.

- Breach/Slow-mo segments are horrible, Terrible hitboxes (I breached a door and had to kill a nazi that was holding somebody hostage about half a meter away from my face, so I shot the hostage in the face... Apparently, that's where the nazi's hitbox was, so the hostage survived and the nazi flopped to the floor) the devs couldn't even be bothered to make the guns' animations and sounds actually adapt to the slow-motion.

- Map designs, don't be shocked when you will encounter: One building copy-pasted into a different area, with a few textures changed and a few static props added...

- AI, it's complete nightmare, some enemies take cover, others run into your face and just sit in front of you while spraying down their MP40, they don't seem actually to bother when you will throw grenade under their feets.

- This game just screams rushed and unpolished... Whoever wrote the subtitles and objectives couldn't even be bothered to check the grammar, let me quote text from game "You have got to hurry up before the enemy shoot the hostage" and believe me theres much, much more of this.

To sum up:
Enemy Front at it's current state is one of the most broken games out there at the moment, it doesn't provide fun as it should do and makes you feel frustrated at some point.
I highly recommend to wait for price to go down and some patched to be released because it's just no fun at the moment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Zapowiadalo sie obiecujaco, jako gra dajaca mozliwosc ciszego eliminowania przeciwnikow, tymczasem praktyczeni zawsze konczy sie strzelanina i to dosyc glupia, bo AI smierdzi na kilometr. Nie dosc ze przeciwnik potrafi pojawic sie znikad za twoimi plecami, to wystazuy czekac za rogiem zeby przybiegli i nie dali raduy cie zabic podczas gdy ty spokojnie z pistoletu zabijesz ich jednym strzalem w glowe,
Zawiodlem sie na tej grze. Jak na polskei warunki to ujdzie, ale generalnie to jest to gra mocno srdenia.
PS: co nie przeszkodzilo mi przejsc ja w jeden wieczor i jedno przedpoludnie :) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game that made me create an account here, simply because i was baffled about its high user score and lack of warning for potential buyers.

Flashback - made by people who claim they loved the originals and were so disappointed that no company made a proper sequel they decided to do it themselves. Thing is, they missed the mark by as much as you can possibly miss it. The game is truly bad, and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind playing bugged or not-so-pretty games as long as they have something going for them. This fails on virtually every level.

Graphics. I know in a tactical game it doesn't matter all that much especially for fans of the genre. I agree with that. Problem is this game looks truly bad, think Silent Storm (which is over 10 years old, remember!) but not as pretty or as detailed. Add to that unreasonable system requirements and choppy framerate even at high end computers. The menus and ui look bland, font is poorly chosen, game view doesn't cut away walls, trees or any other obstacles so you constantly rotate the camera to see anything, which more often that not barely helps. It's just bad.

Sound is there, that's about the only positive thing about it. Gunshots are most likely chosen from some cheap sounds library off the internet, character voices are mostly okay, especially the ones with accents. That being said some are truly horrific, for example 'Spirit' - she sounds like a broken cyborg from an old movie. Somewhat redeeming here is the music, which in some places is really nice, even if it isn't the kind you'd listen to outside of the game. It does the job and adds to the atmosphere.

Gameplay. Oh dear me. This is the worst thing about the game. I don't mind streamlining features and simplifying combat for the sake of more fluid and faster paced action, i very much like UFO: Enemy Within. Problem is, this is much simpler technically and worse in pretty much every aspect. Enemy AI is shocking, they use maybe four tactics to... well, i don't really know what they're trying to do, because it isn't winning fights - of that i'm sure. They either run straight at your guys who are prone and mowing them down one after another, or they stay miles back outside your sight range and take 0% hitchance potshots at You, or, most sensibly, they sometimes will go prone near cover and try to duke it out. Even if they have a pistol and that cover is 20 tiles away from you which does them no good at all. There are times when one bright spark will accidentally find decent cover at an angle and is able to hit your men, but i suspect that's purely by chance that the cover was there and he just happened upon it, not that he chose it as a tactically viable position. Sometimes they run back and forth like headless chicken, out of cover, few steps here or there and then back behind the same cover without even firing. It's embarrasing and sad to watch, and the only way they can harm you is by attrition and the fact that sometimes, especially early on, you simply cannot kill them fast enough even as they run at your much better armed squad.
Now, weapon balance. For the most part it isn't actually so bad, except... If, like me, you happen to find a M82A1 Barrett on 4th map (!!!), you'll think to yourself 'aha, now you evil soldiers are so dead you won't even know how dead you'll be when i kill you with my silly powerful rifle!', and you'll be sadly mistaken. .50 cal sniper rifle is barely more effective than an old Russian RPK light machinegun.
There is no tactical depth, cover system is unintuitive and badly implemented - in XCOM your guys peeked out to fire and went back smoothly and sensibly. Here this doesn't happen, if You hide behind high cover You have to get out, shoot and go back wasting points and time on moving and turning towards enemy every single damn time. It's tedious, unnecessary and makes no sense. There is also no height advantage to be had, stealth is virtually non-existant unless You count going around building and shooting enemies in the back during combat itself.
Inventory is not bad suprisingly, but stats, skills and all the information are crammed into that one screen which just goes to show the lack of depth. The game is barren, item descriptions are barely there, weapon names are of course fake and not as funny as developer thought they would be.

There is also plenty of typos and the whole game feels clunky, cursors get stuck all the time, there is no quicksave system and the whole thing feels like an early beta.
One positive thing i suppose is the fact that i haven't encountered any game-breaking bugs with quests being stuck etc.

Summing up, this is one of the worst tactical games i've ever played, and more insulting when you consider it bears Jagged Alliance logo. Even worse, you pay full price for a game that feels unfinished at best. If you like tactical shooters stick to old JA2, Silent Storm, 7.62 High Calibre with Blue Sun Mod or even XCOM. I wish i had.

Alot has already been written about the, for the most part horribly broken game mechanics and lack of essential features and I couldn't agree more with these complains. Leaving actual gameplay aside for a second, I'm especially disappointed with the lack of details and the totally unintuitive and lifeless background story. You know, with JA1 and JA2, you could literally feel the love and passion that developers put into virtually every aspect of the games, be it the immersive story, the individual mercs and NPCs or even the suspenesful background music. Sadly, ALL of this is completely absent in JA:Flashback.

The game just feels so shallow and soulless that you can't help but feel the devs just wanted to be done with it and move on, which begs the question why they bothered to make it in the first place. To be honest, I'm really tired of sub-par game studios tarnishing the brand name of poor old Jagged Alliance. So all in all, if you thought things couldn't get any worse than JA:BIA, then sadly you were mistaken.

Одназначно, недоразумение года по моей личной версии. Недоделанная игра, огрызок гейпмлея и близко не валявшийся рядом с великой второй частью, которая была взята за ориентир. Именно "как в старом добром втором+некоторые фичи из 1.13" обещали разработчики. А на деле? Мы получили нечто, уступающее игровому процессу даже первой части jagged alliance-а , вышедшей в 1994 году.
Очень сложно поверить, что эти скромные с виду, мило улыбающиеся нерды из Дании, так жестко кинули всех донатеров, проедая и пропивая сначала овер 380к $, а потом еще надкусив пирога с раннего доступа. И еще сейчас поживятся на бренде серии.
Кучу всего нериализовано, что было обещано. Наемники из второй части, которые никаким образом не могут быть на острове, если следовать канонам вселенной 9(какой ,нафиг, бык в Сан ♥♥♥♥♥♥манос, если у него во второй части 1 уровень опыта (он новичек организации), он не был в первой части , и вообще, не имел боевого опыта до Арулько?!), вместо более логичных ветеранов первой серии... Ворох вопросов по гейплею, кучу наплевательски выпеленых фич, которые божились сделать.
Позор. Кидалово. Эпик фэйл. Выкидыш огрызка игры (это все еще альфа версия, по хорошему), дурной тон. Тоны кирпичей.

After the recent update 50 on the KS,it was what compelled me to sign up and review the. The developer Full Control, in what seems like a very desperate move. Writes an update which begs players to positively review a game on Steam which frankly does'nt deserve a 5/10. I've never seen a game developer reach a level of desperation which they are compelled to beg for good reviews and on top of that blame members of the community for their bad reviews and label them as "outsiders"  If  Jagged Alliance Flashback would have received the proper love and funding it deserves there would be no need to go out and beg for good reviews. You done **** it up and having reviewers sex up the reviews on Steam seems massively unethical.

As for the game,if you love prior chapters of the Jagged Alliance you are in for a disappointment. The game lacks all of the depth and fun previous JAF titles contained. The worlds are empty,devoid of life,the story is idiotic and the AI are atrocious. Buyer Beware,if you want a good turned based combat game,there are plenty better titles available,from developers who do not treat their customers with the contempt FC does. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games I have ever played. I am just grateful that I rented it instead of buying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

is this day an age a standard generic movie tie in game doesnt cut it come to think of it ,99.95% of all movie tie in games have never cut it ......... just awful rent it only to see how bad it is or if achivement points are your thing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't understand the people that call this old-school. It's simply Call Of Duty with a layer of paint on it. The enemies are "aliens" that take cover, shoot their rifles, throw grenades or, the only interesting part, they become invisible and hit you. That adds to the fights a little, but it becomes quickly just another meh...I saw you coming, shotgun to the face brother. And the weapons? Alien shotgun, human shotgun, alien assault rifle, human..you get it. All the fights in this game are the same fight over and over again, and new enemies add nothing, because they are just an old enemy with more health or stupid stuff like that. The story and characters are laughable, but I would forgive that if the gameplay was any fun. Like this, it just adds to the pile of ****. The levels are nothing more than dark corridors illuminated by orange and blue lights. That's all...no exploration, just some corridors. And a few pointless collectables that you need to "explore" to find. (meaning they are a little off the set path, like any modern game).  The reason why this does not get a zero is because the fight (not the fightS because, like I said, there is only one fight repeated again and again) was somewhat enjoyable and there were a few moments that made me sweat a little (boss fights, avoiding a deadly minigun turret, stuff like that) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As you explore you are rewarded with powerups and unlock tokens. The powerups can be fun and I was amused at throwing anvils from my car at the other racers as well as some of the others but there is a risk/ reward aspect as the powerups are random and you may pick up a power down or a powerup that affects the pedestrians. The unlock tokens allow you to upgrade your vehicle but these unlocks are unlocked as you play through the campaign and vehicles are upgraded separately so you can't transfer upgrades from one to another.

The Graphics are rough and to be honest I have seen better looking original Xbox games from 10 years ago e.g. Black which whilst not a racing game just shows how bad the graphics in this game are.

The A.I.s all seem to act the same and just charge in, there's no difference between the other drivers. It would have been nice to have different drivers attempt to win the race in different ways e.g. some aggressive whilst others go for pedestrians to add variety to the races, for example, during one of my races I witnessed an A.I. driver just constantly driving round in circles oblivious to everything around him and even a few small taps from myself wouldn't knock him out of the loop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is awful, it is an abomination of the pc version. The game is changed to the point where it should not be called the same thing, the levels and story are twisted and distorted from the pc version, which wasnt exactly a masterpiece, but was still clearly better than this trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Anyone who gives this game anything over a 5 is a total fanboy.  This game is utter crap, the IGN review is the most spot on and giving it a 4 is being gracious.This should have been a novel or better yet they should have held off releasing until the game was finished.  The combat system is a mess, slow-mo or turning it off on regular motion is still crap.  Why queue up each time the same EXACT moves.The monotone voice acting is a total joke.  This game deserves being a coaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They say no one sets out to make a bad game and yet it keeps happening.  This game could have been awsome and fans would have waited for it to be polished to perfection, but no, they give us this.  The story and acting are ponderously plodding but the worst thing is the TERRIBLE combat system.  I played the whole game but it was an ordeal and the idea of playing dlc or a sequel is absurd.  As a fan I hung in there but was not rewarded. Curiosity killed the cat but I miraculously survived. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game that theoretically should have been fantastic but I just could not play longer than two hours without wanting to never play it again. So many problems were little but when you have too many little problems they all just add up to being impossible to get past. The largest problems for me were as follows:  The game was too dark, as in contrast and brightness to hard to actually see the Mors segments. Also the font was impossible to read. I don't think that with a 62 inch Tv I should *ever* have to get up and walk to my Tv to read the character creation screens ( where there was also a light issue that gave me a headache trying to read the too tiny font). The voice acting was terrible beyond belief. I can't believe I ever thought I would say this but Thrillville Off The Rails is no longer the worst voice acting I've ever played through. The graphics were not terrible but they were not good either. The angle of the character to there view of the world was lopsided. What I mean is the character stood at the left side of your screen at an odd awkward angle making it feel like I constantly could not center the camera. Most of all though every time your character Mors or Alestar walk the moment they stop the camera keeps zooming in for 3 seconds. This seems like the smallest complaint by far because it sounds so petty but this is not a petty small complaint because I nearly threw up and got dizzy from it. The game play was hard to follow even with having played Dragon Age Origins. I just couldn't wrap my brain around the battle engine. It felt too difficult too fiddly like you had to play either on idiot easy difficulty or else be some sort of sword wielding savant. I wanted this game to be good I really really did. But it wasn't. It was actually painful to play and it left me wishing I'd never spent the money. Thank God for trading games at re-salers I bought Dragon's Dogma today and feel less like eatin Ramen for a week to make up my stupid game choice purchase. The last time I hated a game this much was when I bought Two Worlds for $5 and felt cheated out of a BigMac and Fries instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

$4.000.000 for make this sh*t. Where is money they obtained with kickstarter?!
It has disappointed me...

About Mighty No.9
· Too boring.
· Horrible graphics.
· Poor gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unless you are Hitler reincarnated, you don't deserve to be subjected to this crapfest of a game.

Unlike some people, I've been able to launch and play the game without CTDs, freezing, or framerate drops. This has allowed me to fully experience the unresponsive controls, unpredictable hitboxes, and frustrating-as-balls stage design. The bosses are all uniquely horrific in design, but a special shout-out goes to Mighty No. 1, the fire guy, whose instant-kill no-escape grapple attack has me seriously contemplating chucking my PC at the wall.

In general, there are way too many instant kills scattered about to artificially inflate the difficulty of stages that are otherwise adequately challenging. As a veteran Mega Man gamer (I went on a marathon of the entire Classic, X, and Zero series to get ready for MN9 launch) I had hoped my skill level would be a pretty good match for this game. Sadly, if the normal stage boss fights are anything to go by, I'm apparently nowhere near the target level the game was designed for. Doubly sad, there's no Easy Mode. I have to wonder, was this mess playtested exclusively by Korean professional gamer cyborgs on meth, or not at all?

I award this game 2 points: 1 for working at all and 1 for the cute plug-shaped powerup dispenser guy, who is your only friend in the cruel, unforgiving wasteland that is Mighty No. 9. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You're better off playing Megaman ZX Advent than this. Sorry, Megaman fans, this is fairly terrible. It's really exploitative and Inafune has always been annoyingly evasive with any criticism, putting up his shields whenever anyone warns him about this. And letting the KS community decide on things they really shouldn't have had any say in (like turning Call into waifu bait, which is awful). It's just a dreadful game, badly managed, and horribly executed. Give me the quite terrible 2.5D Megaman X game even over this. That bad, yes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Picked up The Sims 3 on the launch of the 3DS, and what a disappointment it was. I have been a avid Sims fan since the original, and this game has got to be the worst Sims product I have ever bought. The biggest disappointment has to be the amount of content in the game, which is very limited with only three locations available (your home and two community lots which include a library and stores). I could have sacrificed the number of options if the core gameplay was as I expected, but no, the sluggish, low frame rate almost makes the game unplayable (Its also worth mentioning that turning off the 3D didn't seem to help, which I found odd). This has been my least played 3DS title and a complete waste of my time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoyed sims games when they first came out and I picked this game up for cheap enough. I was just pretty disappointed. The camera viewpoints are terrible even though you can pan them around, the controls are clunky and the graphics are terrible. I got it around launch so I put 14 hours into it while I was waiting for other game releases but I haven't had the urge to play it since. So basically if you have no other games you might play it for a bit but I'd recommend doing anything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoy rpgs, I'm not new to RPGs either and I can't see why anybody would give this game a rating higher than 5. There are weird games out there like Chulip, the Kissing Adventure but this game is a gross insult to anybody with taste and common sense. First and foremost, it's a blatant rip off of Valkyrie Profile. Except they replaced the character development, the storyline and decent platforming sections with menus, more menus, more menus, sharp difficulty curve and no instructions oh, and more menus. It copies Valkyrie Profile RIGHT DOWN to playing on Hard Unlocks a bonus segment in the end. That's a strike against it personally. Upon playing it more, the combat system is totally convoluted and muddled down with more information that you need to know and emphasizes repetitive battling and leveling for far too many characters once. Granted, alot of RPGs have done this but not to this extreme in recent history. The circumstances and even the shoveled in dialog is totally absurd. So your party members are running the shops; Nice to know that characters suffering from ameeisa will rob the party of their own money. Now if that's not counter intuitive, I don't know what is. I kept playing it, more characters kept getting tossed my way. Unlike other cross over games like Super Robot Wars, these characters quickly become useless or yet another reason to spend 10 hours battling enemies endlessly and endlessly. I can't imagine playing this again and I'm advising people to avoid this game like Unlimited Saga. The payoff for playing through it is not worth the tedium. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game bored me out of my mind. The graphics are beautiful but that doesn't save this game from being an over all insipid waste of time. The voice-overs though are given props for having the American cast the so called acting is pretty lackluster. Almost as bad as the Cursed Mask. The story isn't represented very well its shortened extremely and you're not entertained by it at all. The gameplay is over simplistic though the enviroments are sorta interactive its not very challenging the combo list is incredibly small and the special move is actived by a simple button press not very deep, huh? Its also easy, very easy and short. And basic. I was hoping this game would be good like Feudal Fairy Tale yet sadly it joins the Avoid category with Cursed Mask. Don't pick this one up even if you're a die hard fan like me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I bought this game, I thought, "Oh, this looks like an interesting cross between freelancer and minecraft" and to an extent, it is. But what they neglect to tell you is that more than half of the stuff on the screen isn't actually destructible, combat is flatly unfun, and the scale of the game world is off-putting (You fly through claustrophobic little tunnels in your space ship.) The story was to me, uninteresting and difficult to grasp. If you're looking for something to purchase and be pleasantly surprised, look somewhere else - this game was $20 wasted for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another desperate attempt to squeeze some money from canonical title. Game is not "Descent", its not even close to Descent. Poor design, ugly battle mechanic, weird multi-functional repair boxes, paranoid storyline with China, Russia and so one. Graphics can be better and loading times are shorter. Sound and music... yes, there are sound and music in the game, not worth mentioning anyway. Overall - waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Miner Wars is a sad attempt to revive the 6DOF genre. When it was announced with words like "we love Descent" and Dan Wentz (composer of the Descent 2 MIDI soundtrack) joined in the hopes were high but in the end if failed to deliver. If I'm referencing Descent a lot it's not only because it defined the genre but because the developers brought it up time and time again.

For an inspiration they took the history of Descent 4's cancellation: it was supposed to use the GeoMod engine that was then used for Red Faction. So what they did was making it about miners with destructible environments but with 6DOF gameplay. It's not the worst somebody could come up with but in combination with an uninspired cold war scenario plus something about aliens it really shows they were really uninspired.
The 'fully destructible environment' only applies when you're not flying through stitched together prefab corridors which is 80% of the time. It is possible to mine resources and the voxel based asteroids will reshape accordingly which is kind of nice but it's novelty wears of really quickly when you discover how tedious and not worth your time it is.

The graphics are a bit too colorful for my taste but overall OK. The level design sadly doesn't create any good atmosphere except for feeling lost. Descent made use of different textures to suggest where up and down is and rooms would vary in color and shape which helped navigating greatly. In Miner Wars every room is one of a few big prefabs that repeat time and time again which makes exploring levels a nightmare, especially if you consider there is no map. To make up for this they implemented a GPS to point you to your next objective but hitting the key every time you pass through a door isn't that fun.

The gameplay could have salvaged it but it's the worst thing about the entire game.
To begin with it's a quiet fast paced game which in it self isn't bad. What is bad is the fact that switching weapons requires the use of the mouse cursor so when you run out of ammo in a tight situation you can't do anything but hope to survive while selecting another weapon. Repairing or refilling oxygen requires you to open the inventory which again is mouse operated. In theory you can just pick up items and use them immediately but then you're wasting their potential. It's nice to be able to save powerups for later but the way it is implemented was a really bad design choice.

But what finally kills it is the actual combat. To begin with every enemy is marked so there is never a suspense when or where enemies will come from. Basically they spawn somewhere based on triggers placed around the level, take a direct route to the player and then freeze in place because they have no AI. If you wait in front of a door the enemies will pile up and can 'easily' be dispatched every single time. Only problem with this is they are pretty good at aiming and dodging bullets that hit instantly is pretty hard so good luck.

It gets 2/10 points for the use of voxels, the decent graphics and for being a playable game if you look past all it's flaws. The rest is taken away by bad writing, awful level design, non-existent AI and for not delivering what was promised in the first place. The Miner Wars MMO never happened. For good reasons but still...

Lords of Football has about as much depth as the puddle forming outside my window. Just go play Football Manager again.

Seriously, if you want a football simulation, play FM. If you want control over the matches, play FIFA. If you want to organise the day-to-day lives of the characters, play The Sims. Lords of Football tries to do all of those things at once, but doesn't even come close to achieving one of them.

Half of the game involves staring at a Sims-like city overview, where the day is divided into two sections: training and night-life. You are supposed to micro-manage your players' activities throughout this period, but there just isn't that much that the game lets you do. For a simulation game, the lack of control and freedom is quite astounding. I can't stress just how uninspired this aspect of the game is. Imagine the Sims, but where you have no ability to customise or interact with anything.

Apart from occasionally dragging and dropping a player onto a new training exercise/night-time activity, there is essentially nothing for you to do during these segments. There is no financial system. You can't build new buildings (you unlock facilities and new training possibilities through a generic achievement system). You can't play the transfer market (you make recommendations to your boss as to the type of player he should be looking for). You can't scout new talent. You can't hire staff. You can't interact with your players. You can't negotiate contracts. It is essentially just 5-10 minutes of watching the game play itself. I actually spent several of these periods scouring through every part of the game, because I was convinced that there had to be something more to it.

The other half of the game revolves around the actual matches. Unsurprisingly (when you consider the calibre and size of its competition), the game engine is not up to par. It feels buggy and unpolished. Far too many times my players, despite being under no pressure whatsoever, would dribble the ball straight over the sideline, or pass the ball directly to an opposition player's feet. The graphics, as throughout the rest of the game, are fairly good.

Far and away the most interesting part of Lords of Football is the control it gives you within a match. When the game is paused, you are able to give direct commands to individual players. For example, I could plot a run for my winger that cuts inside from out wide, while having my centre-mid play a ball in behind the defence that he will run on to. Once you've got the hang of them, these moves can be really effective and will often lead to goals. This is a mechanic which I would be interested in seeing developed further, in one of the better quality offerings out there.

Unfortunately, the innovations within Lords of Football begin and end there. Alone, it isn't enough of a justification to keep playing. There is definitely an interesting concept somewhere within the game, but its implementation here leaves everything to be desired. A football simulation game where I could actually control the lives of my players would be something that I would definitely play, it it was done right. This isn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really nothing special here. Generic, boring, dull. Other than graphics the game itself is quite comparable to any football game you could have bought 10+ years ago. Overall I would say still with the title you already have. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slow and clunky controls, uninspired level design and unfair difficult spikes make this game a title you're better off skipping, even as a hardcore Megaman fan. Treat yourself with some fangames - they're likely better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's difficult to believe that 3 years and >$4,000,000 dollars went into funding this game. It doesn't look or play well. This will go down as one of the greatest crowdsource failures/disappointments of all time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When it first came out, I was kinda disappointed that I couldn't back this game, but I had such high hopes for it that I planned on getting it on release day.

Well, a lot can change over time. I have no idea what happened, but this is not the game that we were promised, this is not a spiritual successor to one of the greatest 2D platformer series of all time. This looks like something that was made to be played on a mobile, and not a good mobile game, either.

Its gonna be quite some time before Inafume and Deep Silver are trusted by the fans again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game would receive a 4.5 it's bad, BUT, this is a FOUR BILLION GAME and this shows how much this game is bad.
The system for changing weapons is horrible.
Level design is Bad and not fun.
The dash system is not good, some times you go through enemies, some times you don't, especially in bosses.
And do I have to say about the graphics?
Look at the prototype they had in one week showing of and saying how good they are at making games, and look at this, 3 years later.
When a game have a postponement we expect that to bee for a good cause and the game be better then it was to be.
The thing is, that this didn't happen with this game, this only prove how bad they were at making this game.
I really wanted to like this game, but I cant 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As tempting as it is to give this game a zero I can't.  They crapped all over their kickstarter backers who made the entire game possible at pretty much every turn, so they would have to ship a pretty awesome game to make up for it.  Unfortunately it isn't.  On xbox one there are hitches when using dash in areas with heavy background effects, resulting in unneccessary deaths.  Mechanics beyond shooting and basic dashing are not explained.  It alternates between boringly easy and soul crushing old school difficulty with little notice.  Power up distributions are way off.  Some stages have 3 extra lives and some have 0.  A lot of things pointed out in Beta that needed polish or to be fixed never were.  Despite clearly taxing my xbox one the graphics are nothing to write home about, indicating very poor optimization.  They had nearly an extra year to polish the game while they worked on "netcode issues" and they didn't do anything to polish it.  As for the whole reason this needed netcode?  Leaderboards and a co-op feature I can't even find on the menus?  At it's core there was potential here, and there are some occasional sections that are fun, hence why it doesn't get 0 stars.  But man what a disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

shame on you, 4Million $ from the kickstarter for this **** ??? bad graphisme bad story .... shame on you

don't buy this **** pls don't waste your time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I paid 14 dollars for this abomination. If i were to do it again I would gladly have taken a dump on a fresh 20 dollar bill and light it on fire. At least the site of burning my own money would have been more enjoyable then this game. I feel bad for the people that paid full retail for this travesty. The controls are bad, the graphics suck for the ps4 and they didn't even put in the effort to animate the beginning cut-scenes. Maybe im not giving the best review because I am extremely frustrated after wasting 3 hrs of my life playing this game and trying not to hulk smash every thing in my near vicinity. Do yourself a favor and avoid this game. This game gives you that bad gut feeling where you feel like the deaths are not your fault due to the bad controls and mechanism's within the game. For the love of god this game needs a turbo button to be played with. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was Capcom under the influence when making this? The idea behind this "game" was amazing, but once you pop it in, you'll realize that this game was just filler until RE6 and that Capcom only made this game in order to expand the budget for RE6. The companion AI might aswell be non-exisistent, and the fact that I only made it through the first level and realized that is a big red flag. The shooting is made to be weak and just downright stupid, and enemy AI might as well be actual braindead zombies themselves. Just wait for RE 6 to release, nothing to see here 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a very, very BAD game. The graphics are BAD. Looks extremely pixelated. Not to mention the gameplay, iis awful. All thanks to a sloppy job by Slant Six Games. Save your Money friend!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

im being very generous with my reveiw i hated this game with a passion A.I is mental and everything else about the game is to. just plain terrible and i wish they would of made good use with the resident evil logo instead of wasting a valuable oppurtunity 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have been a fan of RE forever i love it to death when i heard that this game was going to take place in racoon city i thought that another spin off like resident evil 3  would be a great addition to the story. so i popped in the game and all i can say is.... WHAT THE  IS THIS  jesus christ capcom what the  happened to having a soul what happend to extreamly limited ammo, terrifying aptmoshpere, and those fixed camera angles that we all know and loved???? that was what made resident evil great and this game has none of that it depresses me when i think that capcom thinks that they need to change their masterpeice into a ****ing 3 person shooter THIS ISNT SURVIVAL HORROR TIS IS CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS ZOMBIES jesus christ i thought that residetn evil 5 was pushing it i was sadly mistaken Capcom better step up its game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Truly one of the worst games of 2012. Don't play this. Don't look at this. Don't even think about this. Especially if you're a fan of the previous Resident Evil installments. Simply abysmal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful game,awful characters,awful story,awful game play,there's hard to think of one thing this game gets right.The only reason I didn't give this game a one is because it is at least playable. It's an insult to fans, that may look like resident evil, but overall is just a bad version of gears of war. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so exited when Operation Raccoon city came out, I had been waiting for months when I heard about it. So when I bought the game for 40 bucks I was so let down. The positives first, The shooting is fun and the graphics are beautiful and the voice acting is solid. Now for the games many downsides. The story is terrible a sadly short. The A.I. is terrible and the pacing is terrible. I don't hate it because it's not horror themed, (hell I like Resident Evil 6) it just doesn't appeal to me. 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this. It was my first full Resident Evil experience too, but after playing the single-player, I am ashamed that it.

The controls were confusing, the layouts of maps were terrible, the AI was horrendous, there weren't enough checkpoints (IMO) and the campaign was short too. Combat was a bit dull as well.

If you're going to unlock all the achievements in this game, I STRONGLY advise playing in co-op. This game is completely broken and Slant Six should be ashamed that they rushed this out of the door. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

honestly, let me start out sayin i want my damn money back,second,it doesnt look like that story could ever exsist in the resident evil storyline, and third.....WTF?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My God almighty...
What the hell happened here?
How can anyone destroy such a great premiss in such a way?
When I heard of this I honestly thought it was a great idea. Playing a team working for the Umbrella Corporation busy getting rid of evidence in Raccoon City during the second game... AWESOME!
And what we got was nothing short of one of the most generic, boring, and broken 3rd person shooters I've ever played.
The lack of feeling of threat is astounding. This is mainly caused by an AI which couldn't outwit a used teabag. I can live with zombies not acting intelligently, but human enemies running around like headless chickens and friendlies intent on lighting themselves on fire (when not running blindly into mines) happens so often hysterical laughter of disbelief is replaced by frustrated screams of rage.
Add to this an appallingly lazy level design, scripted events with the timing of most public transportation services and you've got a game which should be avoided at all costs.
The only reason I can give it a two is because the flaws of this game more often than not caused me to laugh out loud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok so I was duped...Duped into buying this game, why? Because I had a brief viewing of this game at E3 and as I watched someone else play the game on a big screen it did look sexy. But my time watching it at E3 was, well...too brief. I've seen you say, well its another resident evil game what did you expect? 1st off I've never played any resident evil games, just seen the movies, secondly this game was supposed to be going in an entirely different direction than the rest of the RE games - anticipation and expectations were high. Well...the **** game is a dud.Lets start off with a few observations after livestreaming it the other night. #1 - the AI is on an moronic level I just can't seem to get past, your companions run in front of you like a fat kid in COD always running in front of you to steal your kill, but in this game the **** occasionally shoot back at the zombie. #2 - sloppy camera controls and no controller sensitivity! Yes there is a sensitivity toggle in the options menu, and after screwing around with it I learned it did absolutely **** all - so your stuck with a low sensitivity, need to turn around quick because 80 zombies are crawling up your ass, guess what, your just gonna have to deal with them crawling in your ass. The in game music is so light I feel like I'm playing **** mario cart or some ****ed up Wii game which makes me want to rush out into a ditch to get the last shred of self respect back I once had...And the in-game sounds such as weapon sounds feels like I'm shooting BB's at the **** zombies. And zombie sounds, I just don't feel trapped in a city with a horde of undead growling, gurggling, or making those well known squishy sounds I've grown to love from the zombie genre. And the voice acting is - well its on par with your saturday morning cartoons which this game basically feels like during any cut scene #3 - As far as glitchy graphics, blood spatters appear and re-appear in the game which is all I could really tell because the camera controls are so awkward and clunky and makes the hair on the back of my ass stand up in protest! And who ever was the **** genius who said, "lets make it where all you have to do is walk up to an object or structure and the character will automatically take cover." OMG...this is probably one of the most frustrating aspects of the game for me because like in gears you have to actually click a button to stick to a surface and cover. This game your character is literally mister **** velcro, get close to a wall and you'll stick to it, get close to a locked door, stick to it, boxes, stick to it. ****!And omg the first boss, or should I say some bad ass dude with an eyeball growing out of his shoulder that looks like **** MO from the 3-stooges. No semblence of horror at all, this thing literally looks like a pissed off MO slamming a big stick on the ground, with an eyeball on his shoulder. And you don't even get to kill it, you have to run away from it. And you cant even run around him, or behind him, the game literally forces you to go a certain way! I mean they were going for this 3rd person squad based zombie horror survival game they could have taken some **** hints from Gears of War. I am so unimpressed, unimused and wished I had **** redboxed this craptastic game. Capcom, hey zombies sell well, horror survival sells well, it doesn't matter if the game stinks, it'll make our rent for the 2 years. With all of the competition out there for console games you'd think they would have at least put some **** time into making this game, it could have been so awesome but instead is a $60 paper weight. Ok so I'll fall on this grenade and buy the game, so I can basically tell you NOT TO! Oh well at least Aliens colonial Marines is on the horizon. But in the meantime, Resident Evil Operation Raccoon **** is NOT BRU APPROVED, and if you bought it on launch, wipe your ass with the disc and take back to tell them the **** stains on the disc killed your xbox, and tell em' brumac sent ya.

Operation Raccoon City one dissapointment after the another. I knew it wouldn't be a "Proper" Resi game, we haven't had one of those for some time, but I at least expected it to be worth it's salt and FUN. It is neither of these things. Some terrible design choices, gunplay, AI, and overall polish leave the game in a horrible position. This is where the only way you can even get a minute bit of enjoyment out of it is to go on Co-op and laugh at how bad the game is with your friends. The game starts out as it means to go on, with making you run down a corridor, or con-straining you in a very small area and having you fight Soldiers, Zombies, B.O.W's, or all three. With the wealth of material surrounding the Raccoon story, the story is poorly linked with the story of Resident Evil 2, offers no additional content and is just plain boring. Most of the time the game is purely frustrating, with little to no fun at all. It is an endless slog-fest of holding down the right trigger and sobbing at the lack of fun and ingenuity. I will offer an example, actually, I will offer many. The game will often put you in a room and put monster boxes everywhere, until you complete an objective. At one point, you are "Fighting" Ada Wong, who you see ONCE in the entire game. She is at the end of a tiny corridor. The Corridor is mined, and has explosive barrels everywhere. The cover system (Clunky as all hell and just..plain bad.) becomes your worst enemy as you try to move quickly. Her pistol does 3 times the damage any other normal pistol fire does, and she throws Incendiary grenades at you. When you finally reach her at the end of the corridor, she turns and leisurely jogs out of the room, and your team-mates announce, "She escaped". This is OP Raccoon in a nutshell. Now for the most amazing thing ever, and sealed the deal for me. You know how they touted you being able to "Kill Leon Kennedy" ? Oh yeah, it happens. You seem him for the first time in mission five out of seven. Then, at the very end of the game, you catch up to him and you get a decision. You either press the left trigger to "Execute" him, or press the right trigger to "Defend" him. The game then suddenly decides with no explanation, no cutscene or anything to suddenly transport Leon into a building. If you chose Execute (This is the only ending I've played, but I assume it's the same for Defend too, just flipped around.) you are suddenly against two of your AI team-mates and Leon Kennedy. ?????Yup, suddenly, and with no explanation, two of your team defect to the other side and try to stop you from killing him. Yyyyyyyyuuuuuuuuuuuuup. So you have to kill them, then kill Kennedy, where you get a crappy little cutscene and then credits roll. Not impressed.I also want to comment on how badly this game is balanced. The evade mechanic is so clunky, you have to press in the left stick and a direction, then press the A button to evade. Why couldn't it just be A and a direction? Too hard? This gets particularly fun when there are enemies that melee you to death rushing at you. Not. Also, every single soldier takes a ridiculous amount of bullets, and don't die instantly if you shoot them in the head. All in all, OP Raccoon City is a terrible game, avoid it. Go play Gears of War and imagine the Locust are Zombies. Much better.

The franchise parody known as Operation Raccoon City... What a dissapointment this game was. This is run and gun trash out its worst. There were 6 out most builds for zombies, so if there are 20 zombies on the screen the majority of them will be wearing the same thing--it was the Super Mario 2 of Resident Evil games. I couldn't have been more upset with this title. We all just need to wait for SIX to come out near the end of the year... This should have been a XBLA game for 1200 points, not a retail waste of shelf space. http://liquidgamer.podbean.com/ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Resident Evil. I'm a 27 year old man-child who dresses up as a zombie for Halloween. I loves me EVERYTHING associated with this franchise.This game is absolute **** It's not "it doesn't keep with the spirit of the game, it's not keeping with the cannon blah blah blah". The game is just half assed and broken. It's a horrible shooter. I reralize I'm comparing it to Mass Effect 3 and Crysis 2, but if mythical space aliens can only take 3-4 rounds to the head, random Umbrella guys should be following suit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was really necessary? It has nothing to do with Resident Evil at all. I don't know if  Capcom is really getting any benefit from these crappy spin offs and bad use of a popular franchise name. Please Capcom stop giving your franchise to cheap studios and take more care about them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite simply an abomination to the series. Not even going to go into it. Seriously why would anyone want to relive the garbage they just waded through. The game experience was that bad I just want to forget this piece of crap ever existed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A poor quality GTA clone. SCEA decided to whip out a quicke sandbox game to make a quick buck before the Liberty City Stories came out. Trashy graphics, comically bad character animations unresponsive controls, pointless mini games and horrible plot. Not even worth tracking down for comedy value. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this a 2 because in the beginning you get to choose a gang...then you realize each one is exactly the same and it doesnt matter because the ai is better than you. I've been playing games since Atari and Super Nintendo and have never seen worse fighting sequences. Button mashing is out of the question because after the enemy hits you once, you simply have no chance of hitting back.  You're knocked down over...and over...and over.  I thought i got a good deal on a game considering I bought it for $8.99.  As it turns out the store ripped me off.  There are plenty of better games for the psp then wasting your money and time on this game.  What else can we expect from London though? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never bought & a returned anything within 1 day... that is until The Gangs of London. The controls felt stiff, driving the cars was damn near impossible & I got the feeling I was watching an OLD cartoon (you know, the ones where the background is the same over & over again) Yikes! Save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a huge Resident Evil fan and like many others was surprised at the negative reviews for this game. Now that I have played the game I can say that the critics were wrong. The game isn't just bad it's absolutely dreadful. Firstly, the campaign was one of the worst I have ever played due to braindead AI, bland atmosphere, and a terrible "story". One of my biggest complaints is that sometimes enemies will take an entire clip to go down but another time it may only take a bullet. The multiplayer feels like a beta for an unfinished product that doesn't exist. Sure there are unlockables but the complete abscence of any customization options keep you wanting more to compensate for the already bland multiplayer experience. This isn't even worthy of the Resident Evil title because the scariest thing about this game is the fact that it exists. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Resident evil operation raccoon city is a total mess and a massive disappointment. The game's story is about some special operatives working for umbrella to try to clean up the mess in raccoon city. Sounds fun right? well no it's not, the story does not drive you forward to do anything and is quite boring. The graphics look like  look horrible. The voice acting is okay but the faceless characters you play as  sound like they are choking on a something huge and the characters don't have diversity other than the masks they wear they are nothing really special. Now the whole game is bugged i found my self in a middle in a fire fight my gun turning upside town and my character glitches most of the time. The a.i is stupid literally they walk right in to mines and don't really gel you ever they are there to look pretty, also the enemy a.i is dumb even on hard difficulty i found zombies walking around when clearly i am moving around them in circles and the spec ops soldiers just stay in cover all the time. If you think multiplayer is gonna save this game then you're wrong the same problems occur in mutiplayer even though they are some pretty cool game modes like heroes it got me only playing for a few minutes. If you want to get a cool resident evil game buy resident evil 4 or 5 maybe even 6 and newcomers don't start your resident evil experience with this game it is not worth your time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dont  get me started on this game why was slant 6  took this project on they killed resident evil game they try to utlize the resident evil 4 & 5 type of game play with socom  and screwed this game. Trust me this game wont be any good if they took all best game screw over them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Operation Raccoon City é aquele game que você paga um preço de banana e acha caro, vale bem se encontrá-lo de graça. É difícil achar algo de bom neste jogo, a IA beira a babaquice, os inimigos são esponjas, sua munição acaba em segundos, mesmo tendo tantas espalhadas pelo cenário. Os hunters simplesmente te cercam e não deixam você levantar mais. O Cover é ridículo e impreciso. Jogar em Co-op melhora levemente as coisas, mesmo assim pode ter certeza que inúmeros bugs ocorrerão e te frustarão. Os modos extras são divertidos só no primeiro dia e só. Uma palavra que define tudo isso é Trágico! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never thought I'd find a RE game worse than RE5 but it seems I finally have. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Resident Evil Operation Racoon City had a lot of things going for it, a series with a rich history to it, a great reputation, and the guys who made Soccom working on it. So what the hell happened? The one positive thing that I can say about this game is what was advertised on the back of the box: You get to play as Umbrella. Everything else about the game is honestly quite bad. The graphics look like early 2000 to 2001. They are embarassingly bad. When I was in the hospital level, I thought it was a joke! The zombies all look the same, and there are only like 5 types: cops, teens, the redneck fattie, the soldiers, and the homeless dudes. But games graphics aren't everything right? What about gameplay? Well, that is surprisingly the worst part. No matter how much I tweaked the settings on the menu, the aiming still felt way off. It seems like the bullets hit everything except what you were aiming at! In true stupidy, the creators didn't go for a good button-based cover system like in the far superior Gears Of Wars games, as soon as you walk up to any  type of object, you take cover. Say you're fighting dozens of zombies and you walk up to a barrel, you're going to take cover 90% of the time and likely get devoured. Your a.i teamates are horrendiously bad, so many times they walked right into my bullets. But the a.i for the enemy is so damn cheap, they will run up to you, knife you a bunch of times, back up, then shoot you. And when they don't do that, they stand out in the open as you put thousands of bullets in them. Speaking of the guns, they all suck. Enemies take so many bullets, you sometimes wonder if you're even hurting them! At times, its not clear where you're supposed to go. In  one section, I had literally spent an hour shooting at hunters, thinking that I was making progress whem I realized I was supposed to run past them all! All because they didn't explain what the hell I was supposed to do! The characters are forgettable, the story is lame and chiched, and the idea that you can change RE history is all a lie, you're only given one choice where you can change the history and it ends up being lame as hell. The multiplayer is nothing different than the other billion shooters out there on the market.Add that with a bunch of bugs and you've got one mess of a video game. All in all, Resident Evil Operation Racoon City is the worst Resident Evil game to date. Casual gamers are going to hate how bad it controls and how boeing it is, and die-hard Resident Evil fans are going to hate that it isn't scary, intense, or even made by Capcom. This is one trip to Racoon City, you do not want to take. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An abomination of a video game which triples as both the worst Resident Evil title of all time and the official signature on the contract to Capcom selling out. Slant Six Games (responsible for three Socom games) under publishing of Capcom have decided that it would be wise to discard the intense formula of releases like Resident Evil 4, and the nail biting atmosphere of classics like Resident Evil 2 and replace it with a water downed vibe of Call of Duty and a horrid 3rd person shooter in the vein of Uncharted. The game tries to convince us it will be a trip down memory lane, taking place throughout the events of Resident Evil 2 and 3, both being a beloved time in the series. Our hearts are broken instantly as we discover this game is nothing more than a shooter with zero tension, zero atmosphere, zero scares, zero weight, and zero character. At first glance the concept is great. We play as members of Umbrella this time around, and admits the chaos we try desperately to wash the blood of Raccoon City off our hands with bullets and grenades. Umbrella is out to cover their tracks and along the way you will meet characters and creatures of the series golden age, as well as see the famous story from a new and dark point of view. Sound interesting? Indeed it does, and this is half of what makes the game such a failure. While newer and younger fans of the series may eat this game up as an action title, it is only because they are unaware of what a huge step backwards this game is from any ounce of genius that the series originally had. The story is bland and a down ridiculously written cliched mess with laughable dialogue, dumb witted characters, and any kind of well placed pacing is no where to be found. The environments are boring, the enemies are re hashed countless times and bosses just don't have that final tweak that made them icons once upon a time. Aside from the problems Slant Six made to the series and genre, problems are littered within the gameplay as well. The cover system is a joke and often can simply not be relied on. It is very inconstant as their is no button command to enter it, instead just running towards an object throws you into cover rather its what you wanted or not. AI is non existent, enemies will poke their head out right into fire, they will dive into live grenades, and creatures will sometimes attack you and then run from you for no reason whatsoever causing you to chase them down. How can you fear lickers and hunters when your doing the chasing? Enemy killing is very frustrating, some enemies go out in one hit, while others are sponges soaking up twenty bullets or more easily. The game pretends to be co op but honestly with such bad team AI you almost have no choice but to play online with someone. This game feels as if it was meant for online play but suffers there as well. Its Call of Duty formula falls flat on its face due to the fact that the controls are so messy and the level up system is so dirt simple and quick that there is no feeling of reward. You are able to choose which Umbrella member you wish to play as between each mission, but it doesn't matter as each play exactly the same. The only difference being the range of their weapon, which some register completely useless. Raccoon City gets nothing correct in its delivery, and even manages to feel unfinished upon completion. It is an obvious quicky cash in from top to bottom and provides nothing fresh to Resident Evil or the genre of shooters. If you can remember games like Resident Evil: Dead Aim that you may find it laughable to know that it actually out shines this one, and if I had to recommend this game to any kind of player I dont think I could. Its too frustrating for casual players, and too down right bland for hardcore gamers, and just simply too out of sync with the franchise to interest fans. So I guess if I was forced to recommend this it would be to annoyance tolerating non Resident Evil fan gamers. The nostalgia we were promised is not here, the return of horror is not here, the return of icons like Nemesis fall flat on its face and is topped off with the destruction of even the series most likeable characters such as Leon Kennedy. If they were trying to piss off fans this product could be unchanged and do a great job at just that. As Umbrella tries to burn the evidence linking them to the T-Virus outbreak, Capcom should be out there burning all evidence showing that they were behind this game in any way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, we all know this game was a huge disappointment to Resident Evil fans and action based 3rd person shooters alike. It was an attempt to use the RE name on a online squad based game that was poorly created and assembled. The idea sounded good though. As a huge RE series fan, I really tried to like this game and played through it a couple times thinking there must be more here; there isn't. There is no worthwhile story here. combat is clunky and repetitive with a few exceptions. The online competitive modes were also just unplayable as much as I tried to play w friends. The graphics are almost like last gen systems. It was the quickest trade in to Game Stop I ever had. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crap this game is so poorly developed there is no other words to describe it other than steaming pile of crap I cant believe what capcom has been doing to there franchises. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing this game I have come to realise that the standards in games have certainly dropped.  This game was just one big frustration to me.  The damage weapons do to enemies varied on a massive scale i.e. hunter could take 50-100 Machine Gun bullets where as the one I encountered took nearly 200 which I thought was frustrating.  The game has no solid story to it as the characters are not very like-able or engaging and the layout was awful.  I spent 50 Euro on this game when it first came out and was shot down to 30 Euro within the week at my local Gamestop.  Multiplayer does not get much better either as it just doesn't suit the game at all.  Overall I have to say it is a massive flop and really wouldn't recommend anybody buying it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City is a third-person shooter, co-developed by Slant Six Games and Capcom.

- Terrible AI
- Bland Characters
- Bad Shooter Mechanics

One of the worst Resident Evil games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game on PSP is suck a lousy piece of crap! especially compaired to midnight club LA remix which i just completed. Other then Maggie Q, there is absolutely nothing worth me spending another minute driving those cardboard pieces of crap across ugly empty roads. I m so going back to my mifnight club man! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game that makes me think 'Why bother' It has got to be one of it not the worst racer on the psp, its slow, and i mean really slow. The graphics are well below par blocky and just , well rubbish really..The controls are horrible, and there is absolutly nothing to make you want to place this game more than 3 times tops.. If you want to play a racer on the psp then stay well clear of this and go for Midnight Club L A Remix instead, trust me when i say its everything this game is not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

worth a steam sale for...... uh..... well....... free? nah spend yout time elsewhere. Has really simplified gameplay, no rpg elements. The enemies are sometimes difficult but not in any fun way. They just pop u behind you since if you could simply see them they would just be fodder. The story degenerates to a graphic style that looks like the developers really wanted to do a sci fi. then well ah never mind just dont buy it. And for reference i am a DIE HARD fan of both of the first two in the series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good graphics with bad gameplay and heavily scripted AI. They dont even notice you when you're walking at their backs. The most unrealistic sniper gameplay, I mean, I'm not an official sniper but these guys don't sneak up and kill with their knives. This is like playing a stealthy mission of CoD franchise which I always disliked! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game seems to treat players like idiot. Consider the whole game as a long tutorial, as NPC will keep on yelling on what you should do. You want some creativity? NO, it's a tutorial! You will get punishment in the form of bug in scripted event, or even game crash! The game is just a linear move following a tutor until the end of game, and there are so many graphical glitches. Just too bad! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bet you've read the reviews but I have to put this into perspective.  This game is terrible.

This stealth thing...  Am I really stealthed or are the AIs just retardedly insane.  I really don't understand this part.

The graphics are great, but you can't use graphics as an excuse to cover up all the... well, crap.  Stand here, shoot this, go here.  It's literally making life so easy.  This doesn't deserve to be a game, I think they should go back to the drawing board.  if only such a thing exists nowadays. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i waited for this game looong time and played Sniper Elite 2..i though Sniper Elite 2 is bad
and Sniper Ghost Warrior gonna kick its boring ass..but NO..this game is POOOR
not Boaring..why Poor?

-AI is Doll and stupid and even dosnt do anything..they just has eyes everywhere in there head
-Story is terrible..i dont take it seriously on stories -nothing new..just shoot this and shoot that..thats it..no thriller no some good moments ..NOTHING
-Graphics r Poor for CRY ENGIN 3..its SHAME

+SNIPING is perfect..thats it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful use of Cry Engine 3. On max difficulty the game lasted less than 5 hours, and multiplayer contains only 2 maps. Ballistics and gameplay are mediocre, AI behaviour is terrible and unrealistic. Bullet cam is nice, but you will see it very rarely. Death animations are the most terrible I have ever seen. Missions are straightforward and linear. Ghost Warrior looks like a bad joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not really better than 1st part. EXTREMELY short game. There is probably about 3 hours campaign, but you actually play about 45 minutes. Rest of time you must listen commands.... "Do not engage". "Wait for them to pass"... "Do not engage"  "Kill the right guy"... "Wait for them to pass"  ."Listen 5 minutes conversation until they pass"  That is actual gameplay! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring game. Its like playing a fifa game, minus everything except penalty shootouts. Also, how much of a **** can the protagonist be? Sure, it is a sniper game (duh). But being unable to pick up or use assault rifles? Why allow stealth kills then?

The most infuriating moment has to be the mission in the swamp area, where anderson follows some guy on a stealth mission a la cpt price in cod. He will ask you to plant a c4 on a wooden house for distraction, then follow him for a short while and he will ask you to detonate the c4. I follow everything he says, and die. because the genius lead us into a bunch of enemies, and  the blast somehow reveal our location. Tried about 10 times again, still die. After that, I did it by going against his orders (if he says don't kill, just shoot anyways), and basically eliminate everyone b4 detonating the c4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Much as I want to like Sniper 2 its conspicuous bugs rob it of its enjoyability. From the get go I had graphics problems which I managed to resolve. A bigger concern however were in game technical  issues..

For a game about sniping having technical glitches with your sniper rifle isn't a good look. Aiming at times does not work as advertised with the scope jumping wildly about for no obvious reason. Even going from standing to prone often did not resolve the issue. Another concern was the tricky "if it feels like appearing" red dot that is supposedly designed to help guide your shots.Would have been nice if it appeared more often even when fully on target. Lastly a big problem was on target shots  having no effect on opponents. This is especially noticeable during the scene where you face off against Marinov's snipers and soldiers. Some soldiers are almost impossible to kill.

A big question all this raises is one of quality assurance. Did this game get checked and tested before release? I have to wonder.

Thankfully I picked this title up for very little off EBAY as a Steam game. Nonetheless, if you are asked to pay for something, you have a reasonable expectation that is work as advertised. In my experience that was not the case with this game and as a result I can not recommend it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a disappointment to the gaming industry cos a game like this which most fun would love to play is so difficult that your fingers hurt each time you play. I won't advice anyone to waste money on this game. I think they should bring out a new version with different controls. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't think the sequel could be any worse than the first but they certainly achieved a new level of abysmal.  Spotter AI is useless, enemy AI is useless this is by far one of the worst sniper games out there.  Not only do the graphics pop in, there are pauses throughout the game during key events.  The graphics are just the worst and the story is so bland, I skipped every cut-scene I could due to just not caring about the characters anymore.  I just wanted to get through the game and toss the disk on the shelf. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They got extra time with the excuse of a better game, been a fan of part I I was expecting an awesome sequel, but all I received was disappointment. After delaying the game 3 times, they deliver it with two boring as hell maps, the character in the multiplayer looks  like if he has Parkinson, there is no way to have a steady aim unless you're completely flat on ground, and when you find a spot, you're visible from everywhere. Now you shoot and everyone knows your spot because it is announced in the map. The story is so short that even the sale price is too high for it. The developer is a very disrespectful one. If you give your opinion on their facebook page and you say what you didn't like they automatically delete the post and block you so you can't comment anymore. Don't waste your money on this one, if you haven't play part I. I do recommend that one, or try Sniper Elite V2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even for a $30 game, it's one of the most frustrating and sad games I've played this gen. Single player had potential, but a choppy and slow engine (absolutely butchered cry engine) mixed with some of the worst team and enemy AI you'll ever see, make it a chore to even finish. I don't even want to play the dlc that came with it for free. The multiplayer is a joke inhabited by scum who spawn kill the entire match or swear like children. 2 maps, and both run slow. Trying to shoot the guy sitting in your spawn (cause that takes skill)? You probably won't as the pistol takes forever to shoot  Half the time you get kicked from the server. This game had potential, it wasn't executed right. I can't sell this quick enough. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For rap artist Guerilla Black, acting in a video game is not his thing. He's a Notorious B.I.G. wannabe. With a self-promoted game like 187: Ride or Die, it may sounded like an episode of the ol' Hot Coffee scandal from GTA: San Andreas. But as terrible as the game looks and a lame excuse for a combat turned action game, maybe someday (but not today) should any rapper voiced in a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tetris is a great game on its own, but it does need some spice for the 21st century. Unfortunately, the "spice" THQ added for this addition doesn't taste good. I was terribly addicted to "The New Tetris" on the Nintendo 64 and this edition seemed like a promising evolution, but the gameplay changes have left me nothing but frustrated. One big ticket item: You can't play the "story mode" in multiplayer like in "The New Tetris". Part of the draw of modern Tetris games is the multiplayer. TNT had a magical blend that allowed you to continue making progress toward the greater goal while competing with your friends and recording your high scores. Tetris Worlds does nothing of the sort and leaves you with nothing to show for your efforts when you decide you've had enough for the night. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

PS2 Graphics, poor camera that gets stuck on things, or prevents you from seeing what you need to see when you're in a corridor- wobbly character control (makes jumping a real chore in this platformer)- and poor pacing. There's not much of a story- the characters are bland- there's not much going for this boring laborious game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very dated and clunky FPS shooter section I can forgive in a trading sim, but a poor trade section is death. Odd timed levels make game play more hectic than it ought to be. There are too many far better games to waste any time on this dog. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To start off I can't see the people I'm supposed to shoot duringEvery single mission accept there guns on most enemies. It seems like they have some crazy cloaking device which is not true and don't get me started with the checkpoints every time u get to a meter marker. I honestly think the people that made this game should go shoot them selves for making such a **** gay that is 3 hours long which blows. The feel of the guns are good and the environments are nice at some points but overall I gave this game a 2 and I suggest you should NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!!

Sniper Ghost warrior is just Atrocious! The story revolves around Sergeant Tyler, Private Cole Anderson and El Tejon. The whole story is based around a general named General Vasquez, who overthrows some fictional Democratic country and these men i mentioned above, pretty much have to go in and Assasinate him. The Characters in the game got no personality and are very genertic! The story is pretty poor and generic as well. Now what about the gameplay, graphics, etc? Well the graphics are very bad and the texures are very blury. This game has some of the worst screen tearing that i have seen in a video game, if not the worst. The sniping in this game is pretty sub par and comepletely unrealistic. Sometimes its hard to see because of the bluryness and texures pop ups. Enemy AI is some of the worst this generation. They run into walls, they walk around in a jerkey, scripted fashion. They sometimes continue to talk, even when their dead. If you try to sneak up on one of them, they pretty much know automaticaly your there and you die very easily, so the knife is absolutely useless. They run around in circles at times and when alerted, they mindless look around in the open in a crouch position, waiting to get shot by your sniper bullet. Oh, they can also see you from a couple of miles away, as if their eyes have binoculars or something. And last but not the least is the ending, lets just say, worst ending ever in a video game! Zero effort was placed into the ending, of a very bad video game. Multiplayer is pretty bad and is not very enjoyable. It's lacking in modes and depth.

You must have extreame patience to play this garbage! Stay away!

This feels like something I should have downloaded on my iPhone while taking a dump. It's just that terrible. The worst part is not being able to aim in more than eight directions when the enemy comes from 360 directions. Honestly, If this game was a free app for my phone I would be more forgiving, but they actually charged money for the POS. They should be paying me to play it, because it sucks that bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very basic top looking down 3rd person shooter. Very reminiscent of some maps of Contra on NES. Even though this is set in the Halo universe, in my opinion, it does not feel like Halo at all. The levels are simplistic. The graphics are good, but it just doesn't feel quite right to me. I have had to force myself to play it even though I love Halo and Halo Wars. The pay to play weapon and unlock scheme does not work for consoles. Period. I refuse to pay for a weapon or game trinket. If you want to make money like that then don't charge money for your game. Killer Instinct does the monetization the correct way. All in all, this game misses the mark with its repetitive maps and gameplay. Pay to play weapon and ability unlocks put the final nails in the coffin. Save your money and buy something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game that ruined the perfection of the Halo saga. Spartan Assault has poor graphics, poor gameplay and very little variety. other than that the game takes a break. Just terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor graphics meets stiff feeling run of the mill shooter. Enemy AI if far enough away will just run head on at you. Now this proves semi challenging when it's 10+ all at once in a small space. But, it almost never happens because the game is hard not to play at a snails speed. Especially in the later levels of the campaign when all you see is red. Which can be a bit annoying when your being hammered and the blood coming off your character mixed with the red from the directional icon of the enemy shooting you renders all of your characters visual abilities obsolete. I will say one thing i did like about the game. The ability to shoot through the tiniest spaces between the walls to hit far away targets. At some points in the campaign however the clipping corners did get irritating. But, the ability to shoot through the small cracks and holes in the walls was perfectly programmed. Online is nonexistent at this point. So for anyone thinking there might be a small dedicated crowd still playing this game. Think again.....

Achievements for the most part are extremely easy and high points are awarded for the most mundane stuff. So you will boost your score playing this for sure. However, with the online achievements and lack of online presence. You bet it's going to be a lot of drawn out boosting sessions for a perfect 1000.  I found the thing that bothered me the most about BodyCount in general was that it just felt wrong. The graphics felt cheap and the experience in general was very short, uneventful and generic without any sense of drive or story-line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No. no. no. no. no. no. I liked the demo. I thought it was an interesting take on a shooter and you could blow a lot of stuff up. Playing the full game its just not as fun. The enemy is known only as "The Target", how generic is that? While the shooting and control from the demo is intact and fun, I lost interest when it went from shooting at, somewhat equal enemies to sci-fi armored enemies that reminded me of the Thumb-Thumb soldiers of Spy Kids 2. Multiplayer is a joke unless you actually enjoy sitting in a lobby with that one person who just won't ready up.

Save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry Codemasters, but this is the worst FPS shooter ever!!! The demo was horrible, hyper control lag. I don't even imagine on the final release... Codemasters, do us a favor and start making Grid 2 for us will you

I think one stat sums up the state of this potentially excellent game.51 patches - and the game STILL doesn't work properlyNo - you didn't read wrong. 51 Patches. Is this a record? These are all official patches (though Stardock claim many are "Beta" ) and the game is barely 8 months old.YOu can't claim they aren't doing something to fix it, but from the outside it looks like, rather than make a planned and concerted effort to get to the root of the problems (and the game had many on release) the devs are running around like headless chickens relying on user feedback to correct/recorrect and tinker with no real thought of an end goal.51 patches (one every 3 days on average) tells me there is no real plan going on here. Beta or otherwise, corrections are made, recorrected, deleted, remade, tinkered with , discared then re-introdroduced in slightly varying forms.The same could be said of the bugs - both hardware incompatitbility AND gameplay bugs (The game offers no challenge what-so-ever - it's a punching bag where some AI protagonists do absolutely nothing ..at all)8 months after release and over 50 patches - and STILL the same issues as it had on day one. CTD's, OOM's. The forums are full of people saying "Quest broken" and "AI does nothing" "Game slows down to crawl after 60+ moves" Not just one or two moaners, but forums packed with people having the same issues they had at release.At time of writing they have 1.19n out, that's ,the 14th patch since 1.19 alone  - they get around this by sayng they are all BETA patches..dunno about Beta how about making just BETTER patches eh?Stardock are also very ban happy about people who are cheesed off waiting for the game to be playable  - bearing in mind this game costs almost Â£40 in the UK (over $60) it was on it's own as the most expensive single player PC game released in my local Game store in 2010, only a couple of special edition MMO's cost more (Cataclysm pack and FFXIV pack cost Â£5 more each)So when people are upset aftyer 8 months, 51 patches and a very expensive game that is still unplayable  the developer calls them out for"whining" and claiming that he "hates people with a sense of entitlement" (these phrases are still on the Stardock forums - check them yourself).If you love 4x games - the wierd thing is Stardock made Galciv, they made the 4x lite Sins of a solar empire, they made the excellent Demigod. 3 total classics. THis is another in-house game from the same team.It's as if they turned development over to the interns - or their pre-school kids. I hope EWOM turns out to be ok in a few months.For now I recommend anyine interested gets Master of Magic from GOG (transparent DOS box set up - no config required) or Dominions 3 from Shrapnel, maybe even Age of Wonders II - but give EWON another 6 months and check the forums for yourself. At the moment the game is an exercise in frustration.

Wow... I'm a big Marvel fan and a fan of games like Power Stone, but this game just isn't any fun. It's terrible that EA is making Marvel fighting games instead of Capcom, they just can't make a fun game. I was really looking forward to Marvel vs. Capcom 3, now we're stuck with this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game! Not appealing, very confusing, and not to meantion tough as crap. I wish EA could put its stamp on somethig good other than sports games for once! U guys have all that Madden money spend it wisely! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Twice encountered an un-damageable monster in normal play - not a feature, but a bug. Not ready for prime time, needed more testing before release. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game.   Like some PC shareware from 1992.  No, that would be incorrect because a shareware game from 1992 would let you save the game.  Really not worth play thing same levels over and over to get farther. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games I've played since I bought an XBox. This game would've been SO much better if you were given control over the camera. The crappy controls make for even crappier gameplay (you can't actually see what you're shooting at 90% of the time). The graphics and soundtrack are both great, but it really can't make up for the rest of the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Freakin' unbelievable!   Following Valkyria Chronicles, gamers MIGHT have hoped for a next-gen full-3D strategy RPG to grace their new PS4 but NATURAL DOCTRINE is not that game nor will it likely ever be even with a massive 7+ gig patch that could rewrite the game's full install on the drive.  From Valkyria Chronicles, Stella Deus, Fire Emblem and the full line of Disgaea games, this writer has stumbled through them all at great length and enjoyed each title for their individual focus and unique trappings and lore.

BUT, NATURAL DOCTRINE, referencing theories of "natural selection" seems to render its own version of strategy gaming extinct even before the game reaches the end of its convoluted tutorials.  A wonky camera and poor direction and stilted presentation are the GOOD points in this game.

Monster-closets, vicious enemy AI that provides no respite from continual onslaught via unfair advantage will not contribute to your gaming fun.  Issues of balance and fairness aside, many reviewers have cited the game's seeming linearity of "choice" when planning strategies and approaches to the game's myriad conflicts.

One major issue of idiocy repeatedly occurred when the party would randomly advance into the fray without INPUT from the player; that is, after one sequence of linked-actions, nearly all members of the party would alter position on the field and, often, march into a hail of damage from many linked opponents and soon die.

Imagine, as a player, meticulously setting up your pieces, staking out your territory, protecting your flank and channeling party-damage in the direction of the biggest baddie on the map only to watch in stark WTF amazement as the party rearranged their formation BY THEMSELVES when the end turn button was pressed.

Some reviewers have alluded to the "deep combat system" of NATURAL DOCTRINE.  Frankly, that's probably a smokescreen for simply not understanding its complexities.  Understand that it is unbalanced, likely broken, deep like a cistern full of sewage and buyer's remorse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A good remake will make the user want to play the old game again, for nostalgia's sake. Unfortunately the same can be said for a bad remake. Once you play Speedball 2 HD for an hour, you'll never want to touch it again. For the same price as Speedball 2 HD you can purchase the "value" version of Amiga Forever 2013, which will allow you to emulate the original Speedball and many other classic titles with ease. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a total letdown. There is no story! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bound by Flame captured by interest from the moment I saw the first trailer.  I knew it wasn't going to be on the same level as Skyrim or even Witcher 2, but I was at least expecting to be entertained.  The game starts off with a pretty neat sub-boss battle as you figure out controls, but then descends into awfulness.  The side-quests are extremely petty and every time you talk it seems an 8th grader wrote the dialogue. Imagine a standard conversation going smoothly, then throwing in a "suck my balls."  That's BbF dialogue in a nutshell.  The combat system is terrible.  Locking onto an enemy doesn't help, but in fact hinders the combat due to sporadically changing camera angles.  If you fight more than 2-3 enemies, it takes 2-3 minutes because you become interrupted so easily you have to sit there and block, waiting patiently for the two seconds where you can get in one hit and repeat.  A smoother combat system would have done wonders for this game.  In the end, it just wasn't my cup of tea.  If I'm going to have to be strategic my combat, I at least want some reward (ala Dark Souls/Dark Souls 2), not just another muddled conversation/quest waiting for me at the end.  I also find it extremely funny that people are posting reviews after only playing for 2-3 hours.  You can hardly learn a game in that amount of time. I personally only trust reviews from people who put in 8-10 hours because they get past the first town.  I completed Bound by Flame in approximately 18 hours.  I would not recommend it to anybody, unless you want to become frustrated and wish you had $50 back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes this would be Kingdoms Of Amalur on steroids, but it is not.  The combat system is awful.  Enemy's are like sword sponges.  The animation is poor.  The dialogue and story is embarrassingly poor.  I bought this game for $110 NZ yesterday and returned it the following day very disappointed.  I played for 6 hours persevering with the dream that I might start to enjoy it.  It seems like an unfinished game and I will be carefully approaching future Spider releases. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being a huge fan of RPGs like Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, and Dragon's Dogma, Bound by Flame was one I was so looking forward to trying with my new PS4. Of course, being developed by a small team on a small budget, I wasn't expecting it to be of AAA level. But, sigh,... let me put it this way.

Without going into details, Bound by Flame can be summed up as a generic action RPG game. The story is short and lame. Character customisation is very lame. Main character is unlikable and lame. NPCSs and dialogues are lame. Choices are inconsequentially lame. Romance is lame. Gameplay and combat is lame. Every aspect of this game is lame.

MORE LIKE BOUND BY LAME!!!!!!!!!

And by the way, User reviews giving it a 10/10 because they feel sorry for the low scores?? Are you serious?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously, RENT this game before buying it. Don't make the mistake (like I did) of assuming that any Bust-a-Move game is better than none at all. I load this game up for my girlfriend and her younger sisters, and they were completely bored with the game within 5 minutes! How is that even possible? That's not an exaggeration, by the way - it was really just 5 minutes. An absurd amount of unnecessary "special" bubbles, "special" skills, and automatic combos completely take ALL the skill out of the game. And there's no classic mode for those of us who don't need that nonsense. But probably worst of all, there is NO VERSUS MODE - only the mode which places you on the same playing field with as many as 7 other people. But just as all the reviews have stated, it's just chaos where, again, no skill is involved. Continually smashing the buttons works just as good as any "strategy" because there is no way to lose. Bubbles that reach the bottom simply fall away harmlessly. I could go on and on... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was expecting something on the order of Snood, but with multiplayer support. After buying and playing it, it is nowhere near as good. The multiplayer gameplay is completely inane. You get more points by just randomly shooting as fast as possible than by actually trying to aim or strategies. This game is pretty much a complete waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a disappointment! You cannot save your high scores to beat later. The repitition of the music drives you nuts. Lastly, completion of level 500 only gives you pictures of the dragon characters and credit of the game creators - Ugh! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some people here must be joking. Cyanides own forums is teeming over with people who are literally pissed off at this game for not delivering what it promised.Basically what it is, is a very shallow world, if we take the HvH mode. No location or city or town got any names assigned to them. Your own capital town is called Feudal home. Very rich, very immersive. The game itself bases around gathering 100 presige points, which you have many ways to get but many fewer ways to lose. Generally speaking a game is rather short, since 100 prestige points isn't hard to achieve. When you've got them you won, game's over byebye cya next time. The only reason they label it "Brute military force is not the only way to win" is because brute military force can't win the game. By the time you get to tedious wars, the game is over. The game is really a capture the node game. Start with a base, send out envoys, noble ladies, spies and god knows what, and "ally" surrounding towns to gain income. You send out a peasant to manage the fields and 1-2 merchants to every town and gold mine to gain money. Essentially it's just a capture the node game dressed up and labelled as something creative. Unfortunately they failed to deliver. There are no hotkeys, no way to assign armies, the minimap is rubbish and the instructions and information is either wrong or contain typos. Unlike my review, their text should be flawless, the least to expect from a company. Nonetheless it's not. You can find "loose" instead of "lose" along with information that the minimap is on the left side while it's on the right. It could've been done so much better. In fact with a lot of tweaking it's a promising concept, just drop all the focus on the neutrals and increase the diplomacy and underhanding with the other houses. Give it a decent combat system, not combat focused, but you should atleast be able to fight your way through a game if you'd like that. Add more options. For heavens sake there's not even a way to change the victory requirements in HvH.No spend your money elsewhere and don't let those "I rank this game 8 because I've never played any other strategy game and I think this is kind of good" fool you. There's a flood of better Strategy games out there. Europa Universalis 3, The Total War series, Civilization etc etc. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gameplay that would feel right at home in the early 90's are the most forgivable of this games many faults. The campain and skirmish modes lack all that made the books so great. The ai is terrible, the political and underhanded side of the game is insulting after reading what the devs/publishers had to say...I know this sounds stunted and isn't much of a review but this game actually made me angry, that's how bad it is the graphics match the 90's gameplay and yet the load times are terrible. The skirmish mode's victory conditions can't be altered so you will lose over and over again for no apparent reason often related to your kingdoms "prestige" stat...bah just don't buy it it's awful. Not only because it plays and looks bad but because the books deserve far far better. hopefully someone makes a total war nock off with the promised deep political system that cyanide would have us believe is in this game, now that would be worth $40. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, what can I say. I give it a 2 out of 10, because while it does make some reference to the novels, which I have enjoyed, the gameplay and graphics are so terrible, they make the whole game appear to be little more than a feeble attempt to rip off the growing fan-base of the series with an expensive impulse buy. Do not buy this game, no matter how good the sale, it is a waste of money, and whats more, time. That being said, if you like games with simple graphics that are absolutely not fun or enjoyable save for a few references to a book series, then by all means, waste your life playing A Game of Thrones: Genesis, and leave the fun games to the rest of us. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst way to spend your money, i mean this is a robbery this game would be a hit at the late 90's but come on...30 Euro?  10 Euro and it would still be expensive. Sometimes it reminds me the legendary Z (you must be at least 28 years old to remember that game) but this one sucks big time. The battles are boring,the dialogs are lame, no feeling and especialy those who are fan of the book and the TV series they will be disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is NOT a massive blah blah blah. Its a lobby, with a bunch of 8-32 player games you can join. If you want truly massive, go play Planetside, which has been out for years now! And why on earth would I want to PAY to get guns CS:S gives me for free, without the lag and crappy graphics. Nice try, but needs serious work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When this game just came out, it was actually pretty good and I played it very often. Now when I play it again with the new updates. I only see 2 types of soldiers in the server; anti-tank and scout. All infantries will be sniped by snipers and all vehicles will be knocked out by anti-tanks. Assault - no reason to use this since assault is used to kill other infantries, and scouts can kill assaults from miles away without them knowing what hit them. Medic - unlike BF2 where you earn points when you heal somebody, here nobody would even care about other people, since healing them wouldnt do anything for them. Engineer - just like medics, nobody would bother to help their teammates. Also mines are never as efficient as rocket launchers since the mines looks too different than the terrain even for a blind person to step on. So only with the AT and scouts, normally in a game of warrock, all you'll see is trucks and tanks driving all over the place and scouts hiding everywhere in the map. Sometimes even tanks would camp outside a base and nading everything they see that just spawned since it's almost impossible to hit a tank with a rocket launcher from a long distance. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this game unless you don't like playing with vehicles and only play small maps. But of course, if you really want to play that, CS, day of defeat, and many other games are way better choices than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought this game was a tactical shooter. Me and a friend played this after playing CS:S for a couple of months. I suddenly started to see the difference between the two games. This didn't feel tactical at all, in fact, it felt a complete mess. The server lag is incredible, it's almost hard to play the game at all. On one occasion I ran straight past the enemy shooting them, but they couldn't see me and they wouldn't die. So I'd carry on running and suddenly I'd be dead. Then, all of a sudden, 20 seconds later, 2 of them would be dead with me getting the kills. This lag also accounts to many of the deaths and therefore fun being lost in this game. Grenades are, for some reason, sometimes invisible, meaning you can't move out of the way them. These grenades, even if they are quite a way away from you can kill you in a hit which gets quite annoying. This game also allows you to go prone, which is good in some circumstances but it does tend to slow the action down with people using it to spawn camp. I also found that when ever in a direct 1 on 1 battle, as people tend to spray their guns where ever they are, people just automatically go prone and before you know it you're shooting at thin air with the enemy on the floor shooting right next to you. Pretty realistic, I think you'll agree :) The rolling feature is also used a lot in this game. This is because when in a straight 1 on 1 you can sprint and roll into cover, or just roll to the side of the enemy and shoot them, which is incredibly unrealistic and what most War Rock players tend to do. There are many other little things such as the leasing of the guns, the sound, when you hit an enemy can be heard from anywhere in the battlefield, so you can hear whether you've hit your enemy where ever you are. When on the bomb planting team, any one of the players on the team could plant the bomb, which is a far worse than the one on Counter Strike, which is far more tactical. The game modes, are in fact quite promising. Battle Group would be pretty fun, if it wasn't completely unplayable when there is more than 4 players. These and many other of these little things lead to the eventual downfall of this game. After playing this game on and off for about 2 weeks, I just couldn't help think it was a failed version of a mix between Counter Strike and Battlefield 2, which are far superior. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been a player since the beginning of its beta stages.. and to be honest the game is atrocious. One part that all of these reviews missed was the hackers... and although the latest update has prevented most hacks, banned users (who may have been banned for no reason) created VIP hacksites specially devoted to hack the game.. now that is rediculous.. you know a game sucks when there are numerous sites that are being funded specifically to ruin the game. The sounds are meteocre; in fact, i replaced my sounds with my own voiceovers just to make it sound better. The stock set of sounds are just plain funny; it makes you wonder how they even made the sounds. The hacker reporting system is a good idea, however it only works when people genuinely report hackers and unfortunately, there are pre-pubescent (or they act like them anyway) 'kids' that report people for having a good score. Bottom line, gameplay is frustrating and the idea that one has to pay for an advantage over another is just stupid. Sure, itl keep you entertained for a little while, but when you find out that itl take your whole life to get to the level where you can unlock 'the good weapons', ull just want to literally say 'farg' this. Thankfully, the game censoring has changed the censors to asterisks (*). It perhaps was the worst part of the game and would anger people even more when they saw what they typed; in fact many would dodge the censors successfully just by adding in a bracket or two in the middle of the word, thus, proving that their attempt to censor words was compeltely useless. Getting back to the levels; supposedly when you reach level 100, everything is unlocked and you play for free; its too bad you will never reach it in your lifetime, and thats no exageration. Leveling up in the game isnt worth it, for you get a meager 2500 dinar per level. As you level up, it takes longer to reach the next level, but the amount of dinar you recieve for it never increases. Also, the ERSB rating shouldn't even be valid for this game because its always online and almost never is played as it should (with the ineffective filters and whatnot). From its start to now (almost 5 years), the game suffers from horrible server lag and a horrible in-game team collaboration effort, (rarely will you find teamates who are willing to help/support) not to mention a completely irrelevant story. On alberon, if you are part of the green team, the breifing says to find a crate marked GG - problem is, there is no crate marked GG, that is if you can even make it down to the derb side. In addition, instead of restricting certain weapons on maps, they remove vital components to the game. To eliminate usage of the barrett in close quarters, they removed prone from the game, as if to say people cannot go prone when in a close quarters battle. It is a horrible, half-ass decision on their part because they could have restricted its use another way. In addition, posting against their decision to do this on their official forums gets you banned. Not a good way to treat paying customers at all. The only good thing about this game, is perhaps the map design. It seems that the maps were thought out well and there are plenty of cover spots. The texture qualities however, ruin the map effect and make the game look like it was made for a commodore 64. (ok maybe not that bad... but lets say psp) The game is bugged with glitches and cheats and provides a player with an overall frustrating experience. If you're looking for real gameplay, stick to battlefield, CS (which i dont like much either), or consider transitioning to COD4. One review stated you get what you pay for, but in fact, you do not. You get less, much much less than what you pay for. The game is not fun unless you have gold premium, which is 15 a month. The worst part about their purchasing system is that you can only puchase twice in a given period - so you have to buy premium once and g1 credits and then wait like 3 weeks before you can purchase again. The fact they they make weapons available on the online store that are not available in game really kill the gamer experience as well. They also offer promo codes for unreleased weapons to premium auto-renewal customers.(it automatically charges your card every month) The unreleased weapons arent bugged or anything, they just do it to give people even a more unfair advantage. Don't even get me started with the stupid weapon leasing system. The initial concept wasnt a bad idea; to lease them, but when they tied it with real-world money, it crossed the 'fun-line'. It really takes away from the experience, if there even is one. Addicts will pay more than the premium fee just to have their advantageous weapons. In addition, weapon stats will noticably drop when a new weapon is released so as to make the new weapon seem as if it is amazing. In addition, there are certain maps such as cantumira where the helicopters will drive you crazy. Some amazing pilots can dodge anything, and there truly is no defense against them. Sure every now and then someone will snipe them out with a barrett, but its very rare that people even have one, considering one has to pay online with real money to get it. The stingers are ineffective against a good pilot and its rediculously annoying when you can't even spawn without the helicopter raiding it. Experiences like these put this game down into the sewers. This game is entirely an economic scam - There are hackers that advertise hacksites and publicly (in-game chat) claim that hacking the game is more fun that playing the game itself. As a sidenote, you even have to pay just to change your crosshair! That is a standard feature in any game, but not in War Rock. I could write a novel on how bad this game truly is (if i haven't already), but I think you get the idea. In short, it is a quick-high economic scam that will rob your wallet of all of its money and give you half-ass fps quality, gameplay, absolutely no satisfaction, and no sense of progress; ironically, it costs much more than any other fps, and the game isn't even fully developed yet. They need to finish making the game before it is released commercially, or leave it permanently in beta stage because it will never be comparable to a real FPS. If you want a game where you're bound to get angry from unfair gameplay, horrible lag, for the most part an unfriendly community, possible random banning from punkbuster, and horrible customer support, play it; otherwise, leave this one in the bottom of the dumpster where it belongs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At the time it was completely different and innovative... however, even the rose-tinted glasses cannot help Ecco be anything more than a seriously dated and actually rather unpleasant game to play. The controls are dodgy, the graphics (whilst fine at the time I guess) are simply awful and the game play suffers from a complete lack of direction. A waste of your Microsoft Points. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  I truly regret that I spent my hard-earned money on it.  It's just bad, poor options menu, clunky and aggravating interface and camera controls.  Every once in a while I buy a game and wish I could return it, this is one of those times. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games ever created. I am a huge Dynasty Warriors fan, but this game is just horrible. I really wanted to like it. I love Dynasty Warriors and I love Japan so this game should have been fantastic. No, what I got was slower gameplay, insanely unfair enemy A.I., dull graphics, horrendous voice acting, and a ton of other awful problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Except for the women and the graphics, this game has nothing to offer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst game I have ever played. I would not recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh my. What a disappointment. First thing I noticed was the shitty intro. Same bad intro quality as the last two games, and I'd thought they'd try to improve that by now. Tsk tsk. Lets get down to the more detailed categorys, shall we? Graphics - Dear lord. It's like every time they make a new DAH it has worse and worse graphics. I'm guessing they tried to capture the cartoony feel of TF2 into this game. And failed. MISERABLY. I want to feel like a lean, mean, human killing machine, not some "TEE-HEE JOHNNY LOOK AT THE ALIEN" game. The Zap-O-Matic's ray got a major downgrade too. It doesn't even look like electricty anymore. 5/10 Gameplay - Don't even. After 30 minutes of this game I had to stop playing. Lets make a list of what they changed and how. SAUCER CLOAK - Instead of having the feeling of being invisible, you're a blimp. A BLIMP. Zap-O-Matic - Apparently the Zap-O-Matic fell and cracked its head, because it can't kill anything higher than a civilian. The ray changed, too. Bulldick. Ragdoll Effect - Yeah. No more ragdoll effect for you, Krypto. Now, when you have the satisfying experience of killing a human, they do a shitty pre-scripted death. It's pathetic. The only way to get someone to ragdoll is to use telekenisis, which is difficult. Brain Powers - Wow. "BRAIN BATTLES". Who's the wise guy who came up with that piece of crap? I mean, trying to use the Wii and- I can't go on. Seriously. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game hurts. A lot. This has so much potential and when I saw the combat, I was extremely disappointed. The only reason this game gets a 2 and not a 1 is because of the potential of the open combat world, taking aspects from games like Budokai Tenkaichi and Raging Blast but making them more open and free. The big boss characters, again, have potential but when the combat is not fun (coming from someone who played previous DBZ games) the experience doesn't stick. Sometimes, the A.I. is just braindead, and when I knock an enemy away to start a chase combo they don't react. The voice acting is good, but the writing isn't my taste, not like the show. And no LOCAL MULTIPLAYER? Why? What's the point of having big boss battles if I can't play with 4 other friends locally? I know there's a new developer working on this game (and as mentioned before, the promise of this game is undeniable), and unlike others, i'm hoping for a sequel. I'm hoping that the studio can take the potential and all the mistakes from this debut game and make a really really epic game, that will stand true to what we see in the anime. This is Dragon Ball Z, damnit. We deserve better games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A crude Diablo clone that can't boast mob behaviors even as varied as Diablo II's and (at least for now) lacks multiplayer or any map randomization. A pity, since seldom has a game so sorely needed a map generator. Stats and skills are arranged in three broad categories representing very slightly different ways of clicking loot pinatas, but there are no class restrictions. Everyone's melee, but can attack at range with skills. There's next to no equipment customization  you largely decide up front what type you want to be using and equip the best to fall out of a wolf until a better one drops.

The f2p scheme is particularly revolting. You can grind away at each area ad nauseam to buy access to the next  as well as any upgrades to your murdery little woman/man  or you can pay to bypass the tedium. I thought f2p games had been growing a little more sophisticated in how they convince people they actually want to be spending money. Perhaps this sort of thing is still commonplace in the browser game space where Spicy Horse has taken up residence, but it struck me as an embarrassing relic.

Spectacular tackiness was also evident in its launch on Steam with a store page that does clearly identify it as early access, but certainly doesn't strain to clarify that it's a free-to-play game  a category Steam does explicitly support  whose store price buys only a bunch of in-game gubbins.

It's alright to look at but has nothing else going for it. The PC-style ARPG is a tightly crowded genre lately. Even with internet celebrity name recognition propping it up, one this unambitious and uninspired will deservedly sink without trace unless it undergoes quite radical redevelopment before whatever passes for "release" in the age of kickstarter and paid alpha access. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Luckily I bought it via the free DSi points you get when you buy a DSi as this game is not worth anything. As mentioned it's just a tech demo that doesn't even work that well (set-up is REALLY fussy) and overall the games get boring in one go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Warioware snapped is the worst title in the warioware series. As usual, it's a collection of microgames you play on your own. But there are only four themes, each with five minigames that always appear in that theme. Warioware snapped attempts to use  the potential of the dsi camera to play the games. To win each game, you may need to move your head in a particular way, or your hands, for example.
This had potential for a lot of fun, but is bad for these reasons: to set up each round takes a very long time for the camera to recognise you actually exist. Also, whenever you lose a minigame, it's down to the camera's bad eyesight, not your lack of ability. But the thing is, these minigames are so easy and simple, only an idiot could possibly lose them- unless the camera messes up, which is often. You may need to wave to someone (wow, I can wave my hand!), or eat the food by chomping your jaw up and down.
All of the minigames are pointlessly easy, and I think Nintendo meant that to be the case because there is no high scores, and once the five minigames in whatever category you chose are over, that's it. The minigames are so few they are not randomly selected. At the end of each game, the video of you doing these actions is shown ,with photoshopping. It can be quite funny, but if you 'lost' a minigame, this appears broken. Also, the videos aren't even saved.
I would not go as far as to call Warioware Snapped a game. It's not even a tech demo, as it constantly fails to see you. This sort of thing can be played more reliably on a computer, with actual fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game COULD have been so good. I mean....flying airships all around and shooting leviathans straight from the air. Its like Terraria on steroids! but....but its not good. Lack of ambience, crappy controls, a bunch of weird empty generated structures. What I thought was going to be a handsome twin to Terraria, ended up just being a leech on its belly 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game wasn't even worth renting! Horrible graphics, story and gameplay. It really seems this game was rushed in order to make it out on time with the film. I played about 45% of the game until I had enough of the same. Saving fruit pies from mobsters is not what I had in mind for a spidey adventure. Complete dissapointment! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not like this game at all. The controls are a little messed up but i only find trouble when climbing the wall. When I first got wii I had a choice of which game to get. I really enjoyed spiderman 2 on ps2 so i got sm3. I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE. It is not nearly as good (In saying that some people didn't even like the second) I do not enjoy it at all. And cars don't stop for you. I find it not boring but not fun. Definitly for certain kinds of people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a boring buggy excuse for a game that claims to be a nostalgia trip. The level design is god awful, the voice acting is terrible and the whole game is just very poorly made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The multiplayer of this game is horrible. Lots of issues in this game. The main issue that is roaming in the community is the hit detection. This is caused by lag. A lot of this is stemmed by other countries entering in another countries server. When this happens you get lag. Then you empty a whole clip into someone's back to have him turned around and 1 shot kill you. Then you notice he has 100 health. Sometimes you get good games and other times you get these type of games in multiplayer. Its obvious the game was rushed. You really can see how this can be a good game but it fails. This game will be almost dead next week when Halo comes out and will be a corpse once COD is released. Rent it before you buy it. You get a 2 day online pass to try it out. You can not go wrong if your curious by renting it first with the pass. Just remember it is not likely it will be supported for multiplayer after the holidays. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How far this game has fallen. Garbage, if I want to play Cod i'll buy that crap too. Poorly built maps, guns with no accuracy or damage id, and the worst spawns in gaming make this a definite trade in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a review based on the singleplayer campaign of the game. I can't begin to describe how utterly disappointed I am with how this game has turned out, right from the bat the it just spews clichè in your face. After about 2 hours in, I still had serious issues connecting how the story was even connected, and it just went downhill from there. The story is generic and extremely predictable, and it doesn't help that the characters are about as interesting as a rock. But to be perfectly honest, I'm 50/50 about what bothers me most. The game mechanics are something for itself. My teammates seem to be stormtroopers and are actually programmed to fire their weapon once every ten seconds and miss. This is extremely frustrating as the enemy AI seems to hit me in the face every time I peek out from a corner, not to speak of how incredibly stupid it is to take cover behind a truck and expect to be able to shoot through its windows and have the bullets just hit a square box of nothing that is the truck. With all the potential Danger Close had with Frostbite 2, they actually manage to make this a worse game than the 2010 original. I am so sad I spent money on a game that made me ragequit 4(!) times, during a singleplayer campaign. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst shooters I have ever played. Two major flaws in the beginning of the game that made me turn it off and take it back for a refund:
1. Walking anywhere even remotely in the wrong direction makes the game tell you that you have about 2 seconds to return to the game area which isn't even enough time so always ends with a restart from the last checkpoint.
2. Absolutely terrible sniping sections, does the wind direction affect the trajectory of the bullets? As sniping an enemy square in the face, chest or stomach does absolutely nothing, as does shooting him anywhere to the left or right unless by sheer look he drops down dead.
Awful game, even makes generic garbage like Call of Duty look good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your kidding me it looks horrible compared to the last one. Down load HD pack 1.7 gigs, don't bother it doesn't help. All the gameplay vids and multiplayer vids were all on PC. I loved the last one played it through 3 times on Xbox and then on ps3 too. And by the way I don't like COD. Fooled again by EA! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is the time for the big studio to focus more on the gameplay rather than graphic or casulity. this game is a deja vue. all the new release seem to follow the same path thinking is the right course. spend a lot of money in maketing and less in develpment. indie and inndepedent studio are taking the lead wake upppp. to sum up this game is sooo generic that you will feel that you have already played this game elsewhere. skip 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrid game. How could they hype this so much? It is barely playable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rented this game and returned it the next day. I thought to give it a shot like the people here suggest to do but I feel like I wasted $4 EVEN renting it. Bad camera, frustrating controls, CHEAP AI.... the list goes on and on... The only great thing is the music which is AWESOME! Theres is plenty slowdown and drop in framerate here so many people here are telling lies. Check an in-game video of the game and you will see... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It gets a 2 for its beauty. Gameplay is horrible (mainly due to the control issues) and the story makes little to no sense. I feel betrayed as I was so excited for this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man the control stinks, nice game to look at be it's unplayable with this controls... Stay away from it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't listen to people blinded their love for the console, this game is terrible and frustrating. Sixaxis controls are spotty and inaccurate at best (even after an hour of tutorial training), the story is predictable and uninteresting. I waited for the game to drop below $20 to pick it up and it still wasn't worth it. If you are truly interested just buy one of Factor 5's old X-wings games and pretend they're dragons, you'll have much more fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. Amazing graphics and musical score, but horrid controls and boring and tedious gameplay. I wanted to love this game, but couldnt. Also, it looks like Sony sent some cronies, namely Tim P., to promote this game and bash the Wii. So how is the Wii remote a gimmick and Six axis not? Sony added the six axis AFTER they saw the wii remote. If anything, the six axis controller is the gimmick, and it shows in this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No se les ocurra comprar esta basura, el peor juego que he probado nunca, con unos gráficos de risa y un gamplay asqueroso y tosco, les darán ganas de pegarse un tiro 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has a ridiculous save game system, which was so frustrating I had to give up playing. The fighting scenes require considerable skills with the mouse, and if you're knocked out (which is very often the case), your punishment is to start over a long, long, looooong sequence of game history again. And then again, and again. And there's no way you can control this.

The game could be rather good, otherwise, but the half-baked check point system makes it all doomed. My personal advice is, don't bother to buy this game if you don't have some masochistic inclination toward re-living the past over and over again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A perfect example of an indie game gone bad. I've downloaded plenty of indie games from the eShop that were extremely enjoyable. This game is poop. Complete and utter poop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No one but a Nippon Ichi fanchild could possibly enjoy this game. The gameplay is repetitive and linear, the characters are completely vapid, and the story is childish beyond belief. The non-cutscene art is even bland and ugly. Seriously, save yourself some time and money and skip this garbage. Even if you like JRPGs, you should think long and hard before you dive into this mess.

The music is decent, I'll give it that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

no tutorial, manual is not very clear,, support is hard to get,,, never could get the online function to work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry, but even with the Happyness of a drunk person, this game sucks.

It sucks in many many ways, that isn't event enjoyable in a point of view of a goat on steroids.

It's like when someone tells you a joke, and a second after, it's needed to be explained, because no one laughed at first, and even in the second chance, no one laughed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boy do I wish I looked at the reviews on this site before I bought this game. I loved the movie but they butchered the game. Most of the problem is in the camera controls, which is what I would have learned if I checked this site first. Everyoen is right, the camera is so bad that it about entirely kills the experience. Story is good, missions are good, graphics are good, but the game plays like crap due to the camera and is much more frustrating than anything else as a result. Even if I don't like a game I usually wouldn't rate it this low, but the camera makes this feel broken. Broken meand LOW score. BAD game, do not bother. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrible. The graphics are primitive and the layout is frustrating. Battle is extremely slow and time consuming. Just a little more thought could have improved the poor battle layout. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What were they thinking? Once again PSP has failed to impress me with a game with terrible controls and brain dead action. Once agan they runed a possibly good game due to faulty planing and rushing the job. They could have just set this one back a few months like all their other games... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst gameplays I've ever seen in a box game, EA tried to add more value with a touch of comedy and this feature where you can put any picture so you can fight the president if you feel like...I surely won't recommend this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thorough the game nothing really seemed to spark my interest. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been waiting almost 2 decades for this sequel game title since Carmageddon 2. that is a long time and a lot of suspense. But I must say, I see all of the positive comments saying that this is the game that Carmageddon fans have been waiting for. AND, Yes, well, erm, err....... it was supposed to be but it isn't, not even close.

The fact that the money for the development of the release was raised almost completely by fans of the prequel is absolutely amazing! Truly! Unfortunately though it looks like the developer ran out of money and didn't want to confess up to it, or just didn't care about the sorry unoptimized state that the computer game is presently in, maybe they just hated the idea of not making a profit on their title, and so instead served up their fans with what they describe on steam as a "FULL RELEASE". and NO NO NO, this is a sorry excuse for a FULL RELEASE, its a terribly unoptimized piece of crap. Either the development team have overextended themselves, or they have run out of money. This is embarrassing, even to me, and truly, someone who has worked in the computer game industry and spoken to developers all over the world I have to say that I'm extremely disappointed. The outdated graphics, and "Playstation 1" textures is really quite acceptable really, lets remember the DOS version of Carma2 was absolutely spectacular and had terrible graphics, so thats no problem and it was generally accepted because the playability of the prequel was so high. It just seems like a waste.

What a waste Stainless games, you just stained yourself with this terrible release. A real slideshow of a game, by the way that means stuttering and terrible performance issues, even on a supercomputer with the best graphics card available in the world, (thats a $5000 machine), a sloppy hideous mess! Really? I'm not sure how the developer managed to fool themselves that this was in any proper state to release, because the Q&A and beta testers feedback must have still been ringing in their ears. What did you do? You chose to ignore them and release it anyway, and I have to say, looking at other spectacular A++ titles, you have failed, miserably to capture something which could have been the most epic title in a decade.

FAIL!

Expect a lot of "hate" from real hardcore fans whom you have really disappointed. I am sure the turdbuying teenagers won't notice the difference between other B titles, but you really messed this up. and what cost? Another sequel that could have been golden and had great promise ruined by budgeting , greed and project management ignorance! argh it burns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can not even start the game. Fails and gives windows error at start. Watched youtube vids of full release, graphics total ****

This is second time i feel like scammed after buying diablo3. Please stainless fix the game, optimise it as soon as possible. You are not as big as Blizzard,  you ll be damned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DO NOT trust positive scores for this. They are all from hardcore fundamentalist fanatics with top end systems. I wanna love it, but can't even play it, or can't even stand to play it in such a broken state. It is absolutely unacceptable to release a game in this kind of condition. It is broken, it runs like kife on even the highest end systems. Stainless had to know but they bungled things up so bad with the engine early on that they ran outta steam & had to drop it like a steaming hot turd. It is not possible unless you're religitard crazy fundamentalist fanatical (like the few giving this more than a 6) about Carma & you own high end rig, to reconcile the narrow scope, hugely dated graphics & the disgustingly horrible performance. It's appalling that this ever came to market, at least as a "final", "gold" release. I'm sick & tired of turds being called "gold". Fix it or stop taking money for it & give back what you did take post "launch". C:R is Core2 Duo/Phenom X2 material at best & even i5/i7 systems can't keep 60 FPS afloat on this. The content & the game being more inline with something from 2005 is fine. I love Carma, this is Carma, it's a nicer looking version of the older games & there's a huge amount of fun to be had if it were possible to run it. Great damage model, probably unmatched in any other game, but that's the only area that it possibly excels. The maps have really fun layouts but they're small & not many of 'em. Being a small indie dev is a fine excuse for having less content & less than par graphics & lacking much of the things that a larger game from a larger dev may have, but it is never excusable to release broken garbage in exchange for $, no matter how unique your game may be, or how small your studio. Proper functionality & performance is a bare minimum whether you're large or small & Stainless blew it. I hope they fix it because I love Carma as much as anyone, but the reviews ain't gonna change. :(

I give it a deuce, because that's what you gave us Stainless, a big fat stanky deuce. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Justin, are you Derek Smart...sorry, DR. Derek Smart? 'Cos I can't believe anyone else could like this piece of s**t! I hated it, and these two points I give for the idea, but...maybe Derek Smart really should read of reviews his games, 'cos all off his games have the same problems (sh*tty gameplay, tons of bugs etc.). Sorry Derek, two points. Please don't sue me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1 Point if you're just an average gamer: Stay away and go buy something else. 3 Points if you're a serious space sim gamer AND heavy into sado-masochism, because this game hurts you with all the might DS has to offer to his poor customers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Same great concept as the original BC2K, but just as unfinished after 20 years, and as unplayable, as that was...Every aspect of the game is unfinished and unrealized..It just feels like they got bored halfway through each aspect and moved to another one..The spaceflight, atmosphric flight, FPS, space marine combat....ALL of it is just substandard and incomplete...Could have been such an world-changing series....if someone else had done it...But DS just doesn't seem capable of turning out even average quality gameplay or programming. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like A Valley without wind but after about 12 hours I just had to call it quits. It doesn't go anywhere other then the same things over and over. I tried out a couple things and learned some stuff that wasn't in (but should have been in) the big whopping encyclopedia, but was still stuck trying to earn money and keep my people happy and well, it felt like a super cheap version of Terraria. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be, by far, the worst game I've played.  I don't know how other players have reviewed it above a five, and even then, that's being generous.  Not only is this game not fun to play, it actively punishes people for playing multiplayer.  It utilizes a loot system (if you can even call it that) where whoever picks up an item first keeps it.  Without the ability to drop items, or even tell what many of them are before picking them up, it creates frustration between even the most well meaning players.  Except that some items don't function this way, and will stay on the ground for other players to pick up.  And some are shared amongst all the players when picked up.Enemies also scale proportionally to the number of players in such a manner that additional players don't actually contribute significantly more damage to fights.  The graphics are terrible, the animations are absolute **** and the audio sounds like what you would expect to hear as Cthulu awakens and attempts to turn the world towards insanity and chaos.  The in game audio options also don't work, so if you can't isolate and mute the application's sound, then you'll stop playing even quicker than I did (it's a good thing, trust me).I really wanted to like this game.  I was looking for something that had the cooperative feel and exploration aspect of Terraria and Minecraft, but this has nothing.  Attrocious sound, terrible gameplay (I don't know what these people talking about strategy are referring to, Energy Orb has almost 2x the damage per mana and one of the highest DPS in the game, which makes it the best ability even against enemies with resistance to it, and the AI is absolutely easy to abuse garbage), and a total lack of direction or plot.  A game can exist without direction OR without plot, but not without both.After nearly five hours of hoping this game would change, of reading the forums and seeing other players with similar complaints get flamed out for "playing wrong," I can see absolutely no redeeming qualities in this game.  And the developers have the galls to charge money for this waste of time.  The only reasons I gave this game a 2 over a 0 is because no one takes 1 or 0 reviews seriously, but also because this game is a PERFECT example of **** design that might, some day, be used in a classroom as what NOT to do.This doesn't even cover the awful minimap, how the core design of random generation is flawed, the unintuitive and clunky menus, and the dozen other major flaws with the game.  Trust me, stay away from this game.  A Valley Without Wind might have potential in a year or two, but by then I will have forgotten about it and be playing far superior free flash games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I invested in this game at alpha level believing i was getting a good deal but this was a horrible waste of time and money. The game places the player in the role of  a chosen one called the glyph bearer who explores randomly generated 2d levels, casting dull spells and killing enemies with no intelligence, just character levels. The levels are repetitive and bland, repeating the same basic gameplay over and over. If you're looking for a 2d game try Trine or Trine 2 or even braid for a better experience. Don't waste your time with this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried the trial and got tired after like 20 minutes of gameplay which were no fun at all. The graphics are terrible by any standard even for someone that likes retro games like me. The camera movement is spasmodic and need a little smoothing too. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A big letdown. The promise of a burnout crash / indoor golf hybrid was too good to ignore, yet the final product felt like it had been let out way too early. The mechanics are iffy at best, with graphical bugs galore. I could look past the initial lack of keyboard support as I don't mind playing with a pad, but everything was so poor otherwise that seemed the least of the game's problems. Overall you just don't feel in control of what you're trying to achieve in Dangerous Golf and therefore the novelty wears thin very quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game had so mutch potential but it ended up being boring and simple. Singleplayer gets boring preatty quickly and the storyline is not interesting at all. Sandbox has the same problem it gets boring so quickly you dont really have any competition in the sandbox you just expand your criminal business without any challenge. There might be cops on your tail but you can just bribe them over and over again. The combat system is kinda nice although you might rage when you are standing right next to your enemy and shooting him with sniper rifle and still missing the shot. The good thing in the game is the graphics and atmosphere. It really looks and feels like 1920 Atlanta but that still doest make up the lousy singleplayer and sandbox mode. With the current price of the game it simply is not worth buying 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In short words: very bad interface design, repetitive gameplay, horrible combat system. This game has no depth at all, and looks very unprofessional in all its aspects. It would deserve a 4 if it was marketed as a small cheap game, but given its AAA price, a 2 is well deserved. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game takes dull too a new level, trying to combine the action and thrill of being a gangster, with the strategy and thinking of Republic: The Revolution (A game I found weirdly addictive) but some how fail to live up to either of those ideas.

It somehow managed to make me feel like neither a Gangster, nor a Criminal Mastermind.  Three D's; Disappointing, Dull, Devoid of Personality. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing very good here :/
From the poor management of your crew to the repetitiveness of the missions and maps, the very disappointing combat system, the story not very appealing... You are doing the same things over and over, and worse, it's not even fun.
Could be "ok" for a game at 10€, but i'm not even sure you could enjoy it more than few hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This "game" had plenty of promise.  Best described as playing monopoly against yourself. Was going to give it 30, but took it down to 20 because of what they charge for this fail game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It feels and plays like a facebook game just with a faster pace than every 6hrs. The first campaign missions are like drudging through dialog popups and then not knowing what you just did to save your criminal empire! Though the game is pretty simple, you do crime in an organized fashion and don't want to alert the police, which can then cost you a resource or a bribe. Then its combat system is bland with visual issues and targeting problems. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At first glance it looks promising, when I get my hands on it it feels stiff but fun, after playing it for a while I decide to never play it again. This genre is so done, this isn´t something "new" sure it´s a cool thing that they have decided to make in a gangster/mafia style, but seriously how man gangster games don´t we already have? My final thoughts, boring, outdated and I would rather play Mafia on Facebook, and that´s free! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Every so often you come across a game that makes you swear never to buy a game from a certain studio ever again. Omerta is that game from Kalypso.

Awful game, just awful. It takes skill to make a game about prohibition era gangsters so gosh darn boring, but boy did they succeed. I can think of nothing good to say about this game.

Seriously, the closest you feel like a real crime has been committed is the fact they had the nerve to charge AAA price for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's hard to find something positive about this game, when combat system and AI are horrendous.
Stay as far away from this game as possible or you will need medication soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game honestly is really bad i like all kind of games but i still find this game really bad!! but this is a game that does not catch my eye!

My wore may game - Alidengote 2014 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Now I consider myself a huge DBZ fan, so for me to actually give a DBZ game a 3, that says a lot. Like other people have said, this game is more focused on a battle royal. I think the intentions of the game makers were good, but the outcome was horrible. I played this game for two days to try to get into it and I just couldn't. I wouldn't recommend even wasting your time on this game to be honest because that's what it is, a waste of time. I didn't play it online so I can't comment on that, but if it's anything like the regular game then simply wow. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only buy this to play chess with a friend online or are a hardcore competitive chess player and have to play it on Xbox Live. The game is very bare bones. It doesn't have features you would expect it to have. There 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

TLDR Version: This game is awful. Rent it, bang your head for a few minutes and move on with life.The non-TLDR version: The greatest strength of the Internet is also one of its shortcomings. People with access to the internet can write whatever they want without facts to back it up. People who barely have an idea of how videos game were over the years can pick up a copy and get satisfied that a particular game meeds their mediocre standards and then write glowing reviews on the web. That's what you see from the other reviewers here.Graphics: Mediocre at best - 4/10Voice Acting: Very poor imitation of the original voices - 2/10Storyline: Decent but weak and stretched way too much - 3/10Gameplay and Control: Exceedingly annoying at times with invisible textures stopping you at key moments. Camera angle and movement is a pain to deal with - 2/10Environment: Very poor. Very fixed and restricted paths and cannot explore anything beyond your immediate vicinity - 1/10Ending - 1/10The bottom line is this feels more like a fan based half-baked product instead of a professional video game (lol @ you Montreal Ubisoft). As to all the professional critic reviews here that gave this game a 70+, shame on you, grow a spine and adopt some standards.

If I had to choose between pulling my own wisdom tooth out with  pliers or play this game, I'd play this game, but it's still an awful cash in product. With no story to carry it along you move the creepy mascot in a game that promotes stealth, but don't use any fundamental mechanics that actually work. The game is painfully slow probably to pad out the game length but that's no excuse to make only one mission in terms of variety. It's torture to play a game that comes with blocky and ugly graphics. The audio works, but it's not music to the ears. Worst of all, this makes Burger King look worse than it should be with this kind of promotion. It's not the best of games, and for good reason. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I honestly can not believe I paid for this.

Do yourself a favor. Don't bother buying this. The free version that comes with with every version of Windows is exactly the same. And if you don't have that, there are plenty of shareware versions.

The visuals are nice, but pretty much pointless and unremarkable. Not enough to justify a pricetag.

Overall:
Completely needless.

ZZZ... Top Gun Hard Lock is one of the most boring games, ever, the gameplay is same, any new, the airplanes are not much, and this is a title?, have good things, but in the hour to play, no much response. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I grew up on a farm. Though this title claims to be a farming simulator, it's nothing like real farming. Don't get me wrong, you'll probably cuss out your tractor as much as you would IRL. This game is so "sim" that it's no fun at all. It places handicaps on beginner level items that would never exist IRL. (Like the fact that you start out not even being able to harvest a whole row of wheat before you have to drive the terribly controlled tractor across the farm, dump it, hop in another tractor, go across the map again to the dump station, repeat). I'm told it gets better eventually, but it's just not enough fun to pump hours into. It takes all the most menial, time consuming, repetitive tasks in farming and makes them the whole show. It is the worst game I've played on the new consoles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's the BEST Multiplayer game I ever played. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game does quite good in terms of graphics. You can use trolls, ents, heroes, and they can be a lot of fun, but the opportunities to do so don't come around nearly as often as they should. The gameplay is otherwise not even particularly fun, and annoying more often than not. Having to re-start an entire level because you failed at a section is actively irritating. You can be killed in many different and annoying ways. For example, you cna jump off a bridge and fall 30 feet, taking no damage, but if you're playing a hero and get knocked off a bridge in another level to fall the same distance, your hero is killed. The higher the difficulty of the game makes the game far more annoying due to having to start every level from the beginning if you fail a section. I ended up playing on the easy difficulty, and completed BOTH campaigns in 6-8 hours total, leaving only the online or instant action modes, which are even less engaging. A big part of the game is killing hordes of enemies, and the online/instant action modes don't spawn the same hordes, which leaves the levels feeling empty. The demo makes the game look and feel far more fun than it actually is. Unless you're a die hard fan, you'll only be disappointed in this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I haven't cared enough to write a bad review on something I've disliked in a while, but it's happening. The game title appeared after the words "Electronic Arts presents" and I muttered to myself 'oh my god...' and held my head in my palm. This game is absolutely horrible. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because I played it with someone and we were laughing our asses off at how horrible the game was designed. The original army of two used to let you customize your guns entirely, can you do that here? Nope. Characters that are interesting? Nope. The two new characters are so incredibly boring I just didn't care for the story. The cover system isn't anything revolutionary, its been done a million times over, and even in this game's case its done poorly. The amount of aim assist by default is disgusting and insulting. The plot is so stale that I honestly believe M. Night Shyamalan could have done this game's story from start to end, and done a better job.

Overkill mode makes the game a joke, and it gives you it at least twice every mission, even while playing on hard difficulty. The graphics are mediocre at best (played on Xbox 360), especially while split screened.

Anybody who rated this game anything above a 7 is seriously having buyer's remorse. They will attempt to justify their purchase in these reviews telling you the game is fun and that it was a 'good' game. Let's take a look at someone who reviewd it as a 10; MikeGamer4Life says: "Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel is an amazing edition to the series." I'm pretty sure its addition, not edition. He goes on to also say: "The overkill mode you get from performing co-op maneuvers adds a great edition to fights and helps you eliminate tougher enemies like nothing so save up overkill for when you really need it." You don't get it from 'co-op maneuvers' in fact there was a very low amount of any sort of cooperation in this game at all. Where was the back to back co-op ability from the first game? Where is the customization? What the hell is EA thinking? Thankfully, I did not purchase this game, and would not ever recommend buying it to anyone.

Only fun if you are a crazed Star Wars fan.

Ubisoft drops another turd. First GRAW for X-box and PS2 now Critical Hour. Ok Rainbow Six lockdown had a crappy single player with retarded a.i. and such. But it also had passable graphics and the multiplayer was decent. Critical Hour sucks all around. The graphics are ghastly and the old missions are ok but just not worth playing through because of the Rainbow six series usual problems. The a.i. is worse than usual, the graphics are worthless. Simply put the game is no fun but luckily the campaign is short. Ok so the online will be redeeming right? WRONG! The multiplayer is broken. There are numerous glitches and players can cheat to level up. The graphics obviously still suck. There are no redeeming factors for Critical Hour. Ubisoft is really leaving the current gen consoles with a band. At least they had the decency to charge less for this game but no amount of money is worth Critical hour. Keep playing Lockdown people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is EXTREMELY overrated. The daytime stages are linear, claustrophobic, and overall boring. The game just holds your hand and just has you keep going, and going, and going, and then occasionally quickstep, drift, and jump to prevent getting hit. This game has you do SO little. In the daytime stages, that is. In the nighttime stages, while they ARE too slow, they actually have you DO something, and their is ACTUAL platforming. But despite these nighttime stages being the best part of this game, they just DON'T belong in a Sonic game. These nighttime stages have you constantly fighting hoards of enemies like a Kratos from God of War. So with the boring, linear, and overall uninspired level design that just holds your hand the whole way through, and the slow, out of place brawling sections, this game is officially my LEAST FAVORITE SONIC GAME. I know Sonic 06 sucked, but at least you DID something in that game, and it was designed LIKE a platformer, (Although they failed) Now that the gameplay is out of the way, let's move on with the story. Sonic crashes Eggman's party once again, and chases the big bad Doctor to his interplanetary space ship. After transforming into Super Sonic with the mystical gems known as the "Chaos Emeralds" and destroying Dr. Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik's robots, Eggman begs for forgiveness, leading Sonic into a trap. Eggman drains the power of the Chaos Emeralds, reverting Sonic back into his normal blue self. Eggman uses the Emeralds power for his  laser which he uses to crack the world into seven sections. The Earth's core is exposed, and an ancient creature who was trapped in the Earth escapes. This creature is known as "Dark Gaia". Eggman's plan is to harness this creature's power, (Considering how WELL that plan worked before) and rule the world in order to build his Evil utopia, "Eggman land". (Creative name, I know) However, Sonic absorbs Gaia's energy and transforms into a werehog. Yes, a WEREHOG. As in, whenever he sees the moon, he turns into this strong, furry, huge beast with stretchy arms. After falling to the Earth and surviving, he finds out that a little flying fairy dog, thing, has been knocked out. Sonic wonders if he has knocked out this tiny creature, and proceeds to try to wake him up. Startled by Sonic's strange appearance, the strange creature runs away. Sonic tells the creature that there's nothing to worry about, and this creature decides to trust him. Soon, the Sun rises, and Sonic is reverted back to the blue form that we're all familiar with. Sonic says that he will help this creature, and after walking around town for anyone who might know him, Sonic decides to name this tiny thing "Chip". After exploring the town and it's incredibly linear and confined areas, Sonic and Chip find out that in order to restore the continents, they must place the Chaos Emeralds in shrines all around the world. After realizing this, the two find Tails the Fox, Sonic's long time best friend, who tags along for the ride, and travel all around the world searching for these shrines to stop Dr. Eggman's plot, defeat Dark Gaia, and restore the world to it's original state. I can see a LOT of effort and thought put into this story. Although I prefer Sonic storylines to be a bit more simple, a bit of seriousness can never hurt, and there are a few Comedy scenes that balance out the seriousness. Finally, the graphics and visuals. The visuals in this game are STUNNING. The humans aren't realistic, and don't TRY to be realistic, so they feel a bit less out of place with the Giant mutant animals. The stages are beautiful to look at, and the character models are very polished, and this game looks beautiful in HD. But despite the stunning visuals and amazing storyline, the gameplay is just too shallow and too out of place to make this game any fun. Sonic's levels shouldn't be confined, they should be open and free. You should be able to fully EXPLORE the world around you, and not be trapped on ONE path which will occasionally branch out into two or three pathways. The funny thing is, that the HUB WORLDS in this game allow more exploration then the actual levels themselves. In conclusion, this game, while the story had a lot of effort put into it, and the visuals are very pretty to look at, the gameplay, and the level design is just shallow and boring in the daytime stages, and out of place during the Nighttime stages. This is, in my opinion, the WORST Sonic game in terms of level design and gameplay. While the story is a grand step up from games like Sonic 2006, and Shadow The Hedgehog, this game just offers you nothing to do half the time, and the brawling sections in the Nighttime stages can get very repetitive after a while. This is the most overrated, over-hyped, and overly loved game in Sonic history. If you're looking for a Sonic game with some thought put into it, DON'T get Sonic Unleashed. I'd suggest getting Sonic Generations or Colors. I give this game a 2 out of 10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is it bad? YES. Does it earn your time? NO. So disappointed. Too much boring unnecessary stuff, too goofy, too childish, too dumb, levels just doesn't feel right. Generations are 10 times better. I wonder: is it possible that Sonic 06 is even worse? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is for die hard Jurassic Park fans only. The graphics are pretty ugly in portions, with jagged, pixelated messes in various scenes. The gameplay is entirely made up of quicktime events which are extremely awkward to do with a mouse and keyboard. You'll find yourself, at best, repeatedly pressing Up Down over and over to do even the most simple of tasks.The plot is pretty weak and the characters are all shallow archetypes. Cut-throat merc that is totally not Michelle Rodriguez, her cowardly evil boss, Not Alan Grant as the dad, and his annoying, too dumb to live daughter who is totally not a mix between the two kids in the first JP.The most enjoyment you'll get out of this is failing (the death scenes can be hilarious) and spotting the countless JP references. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First things first, the voice acting and the story of this game are top notch. Everything else is awful. I have really enjoyed previous Telltale games like "Tales from Monkey Island" and the "Sam & Max" series. In those I felt like I was actually doing something, that I actually had to figure something out. In "Jurassic Park" you push directional keys and point yourself at obvious places to make discoveries. I did not really at any time feel like I was really playing a game. This is not the adventure type of game that I really love to play. I'm not sure what this is. Mildly interactive at best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm usually a big fan of telltale games, but this game was so horrible, boring with bad acting and puzzles that I almost slept multiple times when playing it. Do not play this game, check out Back to the future instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you hate making choices and the feeling of accomplishment then you will love this game. Everything is event based.  Sometimes you will be thrown into some boring mini game that is actually more enjoyable then the game itself. My 3 year old loved the toilet humor tho, so her making me laugh earns this game 2 points. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the characters and places. But I hate the part Duke get very tiny. I hate the part where Duke control remote toy car. Stupid. and punching part. bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I so wanted to like this game. We need new, innovative and daring FPSs - in short we need Duke. So what went wrong? Well this game feels like the rag bag of development that it is. Some levels are ok, not great, but ok. Most levels are terrible. The graphics are very dated - but it isn't just the graphics, the whole feel of the game.is clunky. The level design is boring and extremely linear. The one liners are funny for the most part but they can't rescue this slow, ploddy game. Long boring driving sections - I love driving sections in most games but this just doesn't work. The vehicles feel like they are slowing you down more than helping. Out of fuel again? What's that - three times? It plods and it plods.Really annoying are the many times when a game character blocks your path by standing in the middle of a wide corridor. Look, I could drive a bus through that gap but Duke has his nose against the invisible wall and the game is not letting me past until I've watched a tedious video on a TV or listened to some dialogue. I want to scream "You're Duke - shove that guy out of your way." It isn't happening. This feels really pointlessly irritating when you find a kid sitting on your throne who refuses to move unless you take his photo. Yep that's right - Duke has to run around after some kid before being allowed to proceed. If that doesn't ruin the immersion nothing will. Bad, bad, bad idea - but it's just one example. I had plenty to choose from.I have waited for this for years. I played, and loved Duke 3D all those years ago. I wanted this to be great but I'm not letting that blind me to a truly horrible gaming experience. This is my opinion of course - but I have stated clear reasons above why this game is bad. And it really is bad. Oh God it's bad. How ever much of a fan you are stop and think. Or at least stop and wait until this hits the bargain bin - you won't have to wait long. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

roughly 14 years....really sad. i expected so much more. i should have known it the demo was really what it was going to be like. too bad Duke had to go down this way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible game, Ive never really seen much to go by in the duke nukem franchise but this game just takes the piss. The story is just bad, the game play is boring the missions are boring, the humor is.....well is it even supposed to be funny. The only reason I gave this game a score higher than 0 was that the little bits added in were actually not bad and take me back to the old days of gaming  still not enough to make me want to waste my time with this crap though 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a terrible game. There are so many wrongs with this game, i can't list them all. Read the other negative reviews and you'll get why this game is bad. The only time i remotely enjoyed myself was using the shotgun to blast piggies in the face, and even that happens rarely. Stay away from this, please. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the game  that taught me never to pre-order a game again.

The AI in this game is awful--you can watch a series of identical enemies jump in the scene from the exact same location, follow the same path, behaving the same way, jumping at the same point in the path, etc.  Game development has progressed passed this point, and this game's mechanics feel very dated.   The juvenile humor in this is no longer cute;  it just seems pointless.  I loved the original Duke MP, and I was hopeful that the multiplayer was going to be this version's saving grace.  Nope.  There is something that just off about it.  The fact that everyone is Duke is also unfortunate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

AN SERIOUS EPIC FAIL GAMEPLAY ..... ODD VISUALS..WEAK DRIVING MECHANICS AND SHOOTING AND EPIC!!.."FAILED" PLOT .. Sorry to say but ... "King just fail to impress baby" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought more than 100 games on steam, and never regreted the money i spent on them. Until i bought Duke Nukem Forever. This game sucks in all aspects: Graphics, engine, physics, story, animation, number of enemies... You can feel that the game was bad coded, and if you have any expectations for this... just forget it. I can say for sure that this was the greatest let down on my entire gamer life. This game is not worth of all the hype that sorround it, and even less the price being charged. This game dont worth 50 bucks. This dont even worth 15 dollars. Seriosly, save your money or buy another game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible this game is...The only thing keeping it from getting a 0 or a 1 is the beginning. You get this whole huge thing of looking back at the old game and I like that. Other than that I'm sorry to say this but....you will have a better time playing Call Of Duty:Black Ops II. Witch itself is a really bad game... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I did not wait 12+ years to have a generic CoD clone.

DNF is not what it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be a good old school FPS sequel to Duke3D. Instead it turned into what was popular at the time (Call of Duty). Just a modern game for the casual gamers. Because the gameplay mechanics are from Call of Duty, cinematics are from Call of Duty, quicktime events are from Call of Duty, linearity is from Call of Duty.

I can't stress it enough how disappointed i am in DNF. I mean in Duke3D you proceed on your own pace, you take time as much as you want to, and you go where you want to go. But DNF says where you can go and where not (just like a typical modern on-rails FPS does). You have to keep hiding behind cover like a true coward to be able to regenerate your ego (health), because otherwise Duke will die from 2-4 shots. That doesn't sound like Duke to me, and it actually is not Duke. It's just another very lame Modern MIlitary Shooter disguised as Duke. Healthregen, weapon limit, sprint, linear level design and everything. Typical modern game.

Played for about 20 minutes and stopped. Really not worth the money. HORRIBLE gameplay, graphics are average. Was hyped up way too much and just really failed to deliver on all areas. Give this a skip 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow this game just sucks.  Game play is lame even during the best moments, plot is something a 12 year old would come up with, and then it hits you that ooh my god I waited 12 years for this game to come out and this is the best they can do?  The game looks like its about 5 years old and its a VERY poor attempt to bring back the Duke but too me Duke is dead now :(  Don't buy it or wait till its a $10 game because that's what its worth. I going to uninstall it and reinstall DN 3D to remember the good times. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am honestly surprised to see people giving this scores above 6, I honestly am. What we have here is 14 years of disappointment, to put it lightly. There is nothing, NOTHING redeeming this game, not the graphics, not the mediocre gameplay, the lackbuster humor or the "story" everything that made duke nukem 3d popular they forgot about. Regenerating health and a 2 gun limit, uh...

I am glad I wasnt one of those people who thought this game would turn out to be pure gold, because I said it 5 years ago this was gonna flop, and it did, BIG TIME. Daikatana just got beaten as worst overhyped game ever made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WOW...so disappointed in this game. Bad graphics, vulgar one liners trying to be funny but fall way short and linear game play. Wait for the bargain bin if you must have this for nostalgic reasons! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've never played the old Duke Nukem before, but it doesn't take a brainless moron to realize that "Duke Nukem forever" is one **** game. For the few several hours, the game tries to be unpredictable and enjoyable as possible. However the **** AI, unstable difficulty, and the horrible graphics (10 years...and this crap is the result) pushes this into the abyss of failure. Tell you what; get a better game. Go play MW3 and BF3 or something that pleases you. I don't give a **** on however you troll about other products, cause I'm pretty sure it's better than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DNF is a sloppily made console port of Generic Shooter 2011. It's gameplay mechanics are copied straight from pretty much every modern console shooter (regenerating shield, 2-weapon-limit, extremely linear gameplay, pseudo quicktime events, checkpoints, choked FOV) and noticeably get in the way of having fun - it's kind of hard to enjoy the game with button prompts in the middle of your display while you're trying to actually play. Duke even puts down a console controller within the first 10 mins of the game, as if daring the player to use a keyboard and mouse to play.

Multiplayer is no fun either - numerous crippling bugs and design flaws exist, from the unbearable lag, to the mysterious multiplayer security bugs which Gearbox refuses to disclose, along with the lack of internal security protection, leading to easy cheating. Spawn points in multiplayer maps are poorly designed and no spawn protection is afforded to players, which makes griefing rather amusing.

While Duke Nukem 3D was kept alive for a long time by a dedicated mod community and the support of 3D Realms, having released the Build editor, there have only been cookie-cutter community-placating responses from Gearbox on the release of a DNF editor, but no actual evidence of one which is forthcoming. This, along with their eagerness in removing the in-game console (to prevent multiplayer bugs - *face-through-desk*) does not bode well for this game being fixed/redone correctly and kept alive by the community's talented mapmakers, artists, modders and programmers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After hearing that Duke Nukem Forever was actually going to be released, I was eager to play it. I did however have low expectations. After playing Bulletstorm earlier this year, I did have hope for the retro-style game that could have been. What I was expecting was not stop battles with loads of alien enemies swarming the screen with barely a breather in between. I was also expecting a game with quality visuals and some raunchy, and current topical humour. None of these are in the game.  It's a boring, dull looking mess. The weapons (except for the shotgun) are stale. The platform jumping puzzles are just annoying, as are the driving sections where it feels like you are being forced to take a tour of the dated graphics. This can't be blamed on the game engine. While the UT3 graphics engine is getting old, by current standards, there have been some recent and good looking games that have utilized it much better than this. FYI, I am an older guy.  I am one of many that remembers playing Duke 3D when it was first released and loving the competition it gave to Doom II. I played that campaign at least 4 times, and spent many nights with friends playing the multi-player part as well. The Duke Nukem here is just a pathetic goon, not a renegade hero. The voice acting is weak as well. Little QA was done to this game.  I once got trapped by an invisible wall which means that I got to a place in the map that I wasn't supposed to have access. It would be easy to forgive a few of the issues, that I personally don't like, but there are so many bad things about Duke Nukem Forever that they by far outweigh the very few good parts of the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is very,very, very short, it took me 4 hours to complete the game on the expert setting. The be a cop mode in career is a complete failure, the cars you're chasing barely move. The cars are unrealistic; my Porsche can go 400+. In the multi-player mode you can't see ahead of you very far if you are playing with 3 or 4 players. The game is way overpriced considering all the facts above. The only thing that I thought was successful was the drifting aspect. The game has plenty of glitches like the one where you go into a wall and suddenly you're going at 1857 KPH. That's just plain stupid. A game should be thought through wisely and tested before being released to the public. Once you've finished the game there's not much you can really do except drive around the really small map and get into a cop chase that lasts about 1 minute. I don't recommend purchasing this game.

Seriously? What's with you blind fans? WHAT part of this game is a sonic game? OTHER than the characters? This game is HORRIBLE. It isn't even anywhere close to a perfect or good score. It's not worse than SOnic 06, but it is worse than Shadow the Hedgehog. Don't believe me? Then play the youtube link. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

God-Awful. The gameplay makes no sense, enemies are just annoying, there is no fun in killing them. The game has an amazingly high production value, but their gameplay is so awful that it actually ruined my day, meaning that I should be able to give it a negative score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+ Nice bikes
+ Many bikes
+ Option to play fairly realistic.

- LOADING TIMES FROM HELL 1:30-2 min to play then another minute to exit game, ATLEAST.
- Storyline where you need the most HP bike to beat "very easy" AI, dont bother buying the bikes you like.
- Boring brake/suspension upgrade options "noname" stuff.
- FPS issues
- The sounds of the bikes are just sad.
- Suicidal AI who always breaks perfectly and as late its possible in the always perfect line.(Very easy mode)

Sure i can enjoy this game playing standard mode, probably learn to enjoy beating the AI with pro mode also, maby even raise the difficulty. But no, its just not OK to have a game in 2015 on the "top" console that has 4 minutes loading for 6 minutes of play.

I wish i could get my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Clearly rushed out before being finished, full of bugs and glitches. Uninspiring and unoriginal gameplay, deeply lacklustre graphics, terrible voice-acting. Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fly around with the circle pad? Ok. "Ping" enemies with the stylus? Ok. But wait...I'm left-handed. Not to mention the very first level is impossible. The enemies fly way too quickly to catch up. Each one shoots three bullets in each direction. Unless you get lucky and manage to ping AND kill each one, you're going to get riddled with bullets, which are tiny by the way, making them impossible to keep track of in addition to pings and enemies. You may be invincible while using your power, but that doesn't last long, especially if you don't manage to hit anything. If you're on the fence about this one, take my advice and skip it or wait for it to be available for rent. This is $40 I wish I didn't waste. In reply to Tanasinn: How can he play level 2 if he can't get past level 1? I'm right in the same boat as he is; the minute I do well -at all-, I run out of power and basically can only just sit there and wait to die yet again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really have a soft spot for the Ace Combat series but this F2P trend is growing worrisome for me. I mean Tekken Revolution's token system where you must wait a half hour for a coin to play seemed a tad excessive. However, with AC you must wait an outrageous four hours for a fuel supply. In which the max fuel supply is a paltry three units that fly by in an instant.

On top of that, the most insulting part is the campaign in which you must either spend a ridiculous 20 dollars for an unlimited campaign ticket or waste innumerable hours stocking hundreds of thousands of credits to play one campaign mission of eight which go up in price every mission

Ex. Mission #2 200,000 credits, Mission #3 300,000 and so on and so forth...
It sounds easy enough and relatively obtainable but if you're not a good enough pilot or just beginning, get ready for only a average of 8,000 credits or so with every sortie. Not even taking into account the credits you have to spend to buy parts, planes, or upgrades.

The aircraft tree is a complete joke it takes WAY too long to unlock particular planes and all of which are so drastically under powered compared to special planes that you can buy with actual money or hope for a random drop. It's a wonder why anyone even wants to play Ace Combat Infinity, this game is a supreme example of how spending hundreds of dollars can net the fool who wastes his money some meager sense of superiority with his bought "skills".

Do yourself a favor and AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The franchise has been a great one and the graphics on this one are amazing. I'm glad they even got away from that dogfighting mode(which killed AH), however that's all I can say that is positive about this game.

The whole waiting for fuel to recharge is bogus, so unless you want to wait you have to purchase fuel. That's something cell phone apps do. Also if you want to unlock planes you have to play online because it's quicker to get everything online, which makes the game rather annoying. Then the fact that everything is online, so what about when PS3 isn't online anymore like PS2? Then all that hard work was for nothing. This game could of been amazing had they kept it within it's roots of what made the series what it is today.

With that being said, you should stay far away from this game. I regret the couple of hours I spent playing it.

Este juego es un desastre. Bueno, que podía esperar de un F2P?...
Gráficamente cumple, aunque los escenarios son mas planos que la suela de un zapato, los aviones y la iluminación son correctos. Pero el juego es un laberinto de menús, los cuales ya da pereza el simple hecho de leerlos. Todo es demasiado enrevesado y simple a la vez, la campaña es pobre, unas cuantas misiones de acabar con aviones, objetos y poco mas. Las misiones coop. son frustrantes, no entendía ni que estaba haciendo. Tras jugarlo un poco lo borré, tres gigas para esto era un desperdicio.

While it tries to be a laid back platformer, Frogger: Ancient Shadow is a frustrating exercise in awkward controls. It tries to maintain the one tap = one unit of movement mechanics that the original Frogger used. It fails at this greatly, spreading out every little movement over all the gamepad buttons. For example, there are two different jump buttons. to rotate the character you have to use the shoulder buttons. Tapping the directional pad will cause the poor frog to jump into the water and drown. Yes, the frog can't swim. THE FROG CAN'T SWIM. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played the original a lot. It was fun, had some interesting play mechanics, a certain charm to the graphics, odd sound effects, and great music.The "Deluxe" edition is missing most of these things. This game only has passing similarity to the original in the most important department, and that is feel. It just doesn't feel fun to play. The original is still more fun, even though it is nearing 30 years of age.My review score isn't lower because the game at least functions. See Assault Rigs for the kind of game I would give a zero. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible! Don't buy it...don't even download it. Waste of time and money. Laggy even if your computer is is fast. It's completely bugged. Controls suck so bad. Sensitivity sucks even at max. Avoid. If you really want to play it get the console ones. Controls are much better with them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I first heard that this game went to F2P I was angry, I wanted to buy a physical edition and support this unique, quirky little game. I settled for the Founder's Pack instead.

My god, am I glad I didn't buy a retail version of this game, HUGE buyer's remorse.

The game is a clunky mess but more importantly, it's filled with so many stupid design decisions that I simply don't understand. It's like they didn't even playtest this game and just decided to throw a bunch of sh*t at a wall to see what stuck.

To say it has the depth of a puddle would be giving it too much credit. After literally 30 minutes you've already done everything that can be done and then you're stuck in an endless chore simulator while random people pop in and carry your mined resources away to claim tickets. Getting on a bus to visit an island that has basically been mined dry is always fun...

The developer seems to think he has laid a golden egg with this game and that because he's spent 5 years working on it we need to be grateful for this shallow mess of a game. Sorry mate, your game looks pretty, the gameplay however is terrible.

Final words: Wasted potential. I genuinely don't think updates can fix this, it's just poorly executed from the ground up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Looks pretty" is not enough to make a football game worth buying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game stinks! With graphics that make PlayStation two look like a next-gen system and the storyline so  ridiculous you actually have to wonder if the developers who created this game were high! Avoid this game or Tri City And buy something better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I find it funny how even the stupidest Sony drones can find this piece of **** fun to play it's repetitive and boring if you want a good PS4 game wait until infamous or uncharted or anything but this abomination. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Knack is one of the worst games I've ever played. At least Killzone was fun for the first 2 to 3 hours. Knack on the other hand was a blah-fest from the first 5 minutes. I really hope the next game by this development team is better than Knack, because it was pretty awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The saddest part of this game is that I liked it for the wrong reasons. The only thing I like about this game was that the fun level design and quirky characters brought back memories from the time that I played Jak and Daxter, Sly Cooper, Ratchet and Clank, and even Crash Bandicoot. What is bad about that is that it caused me to see what a bad game Knack really was. After removing myself from my PS4 after playing about 4 hours of the game, I sat back and realized that I had wasted those four hours on the monstrosity that is Knack. Look, I appreciate what the developers of the game were attempting to accomplish with this game, to make a game a kid could enjoy. The problem is a kid couldn't possibly enjoy this game! I handed the ps4 controller to my younger sister and she lost interest, the game is soooo repetitive (I mean there are only three, yes THREE, punches Knack executes in the game) also this game is too difficult for children.  Also, this game has a huge identity problems, its trying to be too serious, once again this is a game directed towards children and children at heart. This is a game I should be able to play without having to experience a story of betrayal and loss, it is meant for kids! I thought this game would be fun, thank god I didn't pay full price on this. Knack is just a game of punch, dodge, and hook. If the game doesn't understand itself than how can I? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What can be worse that new Killzone? Only this. One big plus of the game-it's very difficult. Dark souls for children. Green goblins, heart-kind Knack-it's nice but authors doesn't know about sense of humor. That's a pity, friends 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very repetitive. Knack is destined to be a forgotten mascot and rightfully so. There will never be a sequel to Knack and that's a good thing. Bland environments, very repetitive combat, lousy characters and storytelling, and not enough platforming, makes this one you want to avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game itself was alright, However, it only has five cases in the whole game! It took me a day and I completed the game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is the glorious Gabriel Knight, than there is this cheesiest dialogues piled up on top of each other with completely illogical character behaviors. Only positivity I can take from Moebius is that it hopefully will fund a new Gabriel Knight game but if they make it as cheesy as Moebius or make Gabriel sound and talk like Malachi or Tim Curry, I can't get my hopes up for even mediocrity.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The quality of this game is abysmal.
It starts with the writing, where not much in the storyline actually makes sense, and you are better off NOT asking questions about it, or trying to analyze it. You won't get far before your brain shortcircuits.
The contrived plot and pained dialogue, that look like they had been written in a rushed span of a weekend, are wonderfully complemented by the efforts of a less than competent development team to animate it.
The result is a one of a kind creation, with a cast of exceptionally badly animated 3D characters on ok-ish 2D backgrounds, enacting a story, which if you won't forget, it's owing to its unexpectedly bad ideas.
The development studio should first and foremost concentrate on finding talented visual artists, with capabilities beyond that of mediocre amateurishness, if they seriously wish to produce computer games on a professional level.
The author should not underestimate the intelligence and taste of her prospective audience, and if she wishes to live up to her name and fame, it will need a more serious attempt, with much more effort, thought, research and care invested.
Some self-reflection is probably in order for both parts of the team.
I give a score of 2 for trying (1 for the design and 1 for its execution (pun intended)). Otherwise this is unforgivable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Uses Denuvo, can only be **** A wise man once told me "If Game Dev's care more for Protection rather than Game content, the Game will be **** True words. Awfully optimized. Not worth any cent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the **** sequel ever to be made in the history of gaming (had to put it this way). Really pissed off at what they made , I mean the game's graphics are **** , the clumsiest AI , i got stuck in an NPC civilian for about 10 minutes for christ's sake !
Conclusion: Don't buy this game , this game doesn't deserve any money at all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another disappointment from Deep Silver (Seriously, why are they still  in the gaming industry?)

First of, it doesn't look next-gen, it looks like a PS3. Full of bugs and glitches, terrible AI. Runs at 20 FPS. Interesting setting?

None of the characters are memorable, seriously I can't remember anyone from the campaign.
Overall this is just a painfully average game, just like the first one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok ok. Here we go with this garbage. This is one of the worst games iv ever played. The frame rate is total garbage, the gunplay is the worst iv played in ages. There are identical npc's standing next to each other in the game. The grafics are rubbish. And to top it off its boring as hell. The bad reviews are totally warranted. Please do not give them your money. This is lazy crap 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Homefront Revolution has horrible graphics, in some light conditions you can't see anything. I have changed settings several times to get the best picture.  I've see better  graphics in PS2 games than this. The aim assist works 1 in 50, maybe. Worst 50$ spent. should've waited. I would recommend you play the trial version to see if you want to waste your $$$$. Seems to be a low budget game for lots of $$$$. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first game I loved even though most people think otherwise, and with this second title I was very disappointed.

He could have kicked the competition and innovated in something, but no. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not an mmo, it has a lobby with 3 instanced pvp arena game types. There is no world pvp pve or what have you, It's a simple versus game like every other online game except fury has a glorified lobby which you can move in. It would be like making a graphical lobby instead of a text based one for diablo 2 or tf2 and instead of browsing games in a browser you left click an npc in a graphical lobby and browse them there then call them mmorpg and mmofps, I think not. The games graphics look washed out, might have something to do with the unreal 3 engine so i can see them being improved once the engine gets a fix. The game play is complex and confusing at best with fotm builds running supreme, The skill is finding the fotm build or having a friend tell you it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is Dead on Arrival. So many mistakes have been made with the marketing and release of this bug ridden half game its not funny. Not enough content, overly complex archetype skills that are just the same thing with a different color X 4000. What could have been a good PVP game turned into a cheap knock off of GW pvp and WOW arena done very poorly. Horrible user interface, unbalanced skill sets, and the worst implementation of the unreal engine ever. For all the resources this pig eats up, it runs like crap and looks nowhere near as nice as the screenshots they advertise with. Its not an MMO its a Mistake. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrible. I can't believe Xbox 360 has the nerve to put something out like this. The graphics and the game as a whole remind me of some game that should have been available only on PS2...years ago. The story is something that I couldn't even follow because I dont think there was much of a story. Any kind of words displayed on the screen were absolutely unreadable. I couldn't figure out what was used for which button thats how unreadable the words were. The graphics are such that the only way you can tell where you enemies are is if they are moving i.e. the Final Fantasy mmorpg for the same console. I just bought this game and will be returning it in the same day. I bought this game to get away from FPS's that are all too present in Xbox 360 and now I'm screaming for my Rainbow Six. I gave it a 2 only because it is playable, technically. Point is...DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WOW....not the game, the expression. That is what I was left saying after wasting 2 hours of my life on this game. I was really pumped for a Gauntlet-like next-gen game, but boy was I disappointed. First, no story line at all to sink you in. You just start running through monotonous maps that have no possibilities of exploration. You literally run around hacking hords of monsters. Terrible, terrible game IMO. Only good thing I can say is cool character design, beyond that, stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

O filme  tão bosta quanto meu amigo Caio Jaime. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As an avid Lost fan, I got this game as a rental to see if it was any good or revealed anything about the TV series. I was more than disappointed. This is a game that is an embarrassment to me as a fan of the Lost TV series. It's clunky, poorly designed and although it looks quite good, the island is so 1-dimensional that you can rarely go off a set path. The characters were not voiced by their TV counterparts and you play as a nobody. You go around taking photos of the island and in the end it's just totally boring. This is one of the few games I cannot recommend anyone play, Lost fan or not. 1/5, just plain bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, this gameplay sucks big time. People can get blind because the blurred background. Fortunately "Gran Turismo 3" is saving the PS2. I have never played a game like this. If you ask me they have to balance the steering wheels. This is toooooo fakeee. When I steer right it has to go right not left. CAPICH 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, so it has voice overs from the actual actors, the graphics are pretty good, and Syd and Dixon look like the actual actors (Jack, Marshall, and Vaughn, however, didn't fair so well. This is the only good I can really say of the game (PC at least). The control set-up is absoulutely horrible, the controls don't always work like they should, and the cameras are attrocious! Fighting is way to simple. This game would be great if their had been more effort put into the game other than the look of the game. Only fans of the show will care for this game, and fans who are serious gamers ("evercrack" players don't apply) are only playing it out of loyalty to the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While a game where you are two storey high Transformers rampaging around town sounds great, the developers of this game suck out all the fun with tedious and ridiculous "chapters", awful controls, and a general lack of any refinement in a rush to get this out the door for the movie release. A very good example of how bad the industry has gotten when you look at the money that went into this game, versus what came out the other end. The graphics are nice for sure, but that doesn't count for much when you are turning the game off in disgust. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A real sleeping pill. No action at all, not even cutscenes and I like card basedgames. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had huge expectations for this game before I bought it. As a big rugby fan, I also bought EA Rugby 2001. Although that game was buggy & frustrating and came with an incomplete, error-filled manual, it did have a few positive aspects (a good passing game, for example) that made the purchase worthwhile. So when I opened the box for the 2004 version, I was expecting big improvements: easy-to-control players, a proper system for controlling scrums, rucks, mauls & lineouts and a good manual. I was VERY wrong. I never thought it was possible, but this game is probably far worse than the 2001 version. In fact, it may be one of the worst games I have ever purchased. So where can I start? This is just a few issues I've had with this game. - Controlling rucks and mauls. This appears to be completely random. There is no description in the so-called manual about committing players to a ruck/maul when you have possession, simply because it appears that you can't ? it's all done automatically. - Selecting players when defending is a complete mess. The manual describes how to bind and remove players when defending, but on the PC it has very little effect. But then again, when you don't have the ball, you're normally too busy figuring out what player you're controlling at any particular time to even care. - It's runs slow and jerky ? my machine is 2.0ghz, 256MB RAM with a TNT2 Ultra Gamer Video Card. Note that I can play FIFA 2003 at near-maximum setting and it runs like a dream. - It's very buggy ? for example, I've had to restart numerous games because all the graphics disappear (except for the radar at the bottom) and the screen turns green after the opposition kicked the ball into touch. However, despite the vanishing graphics, I can still hear the... ...Terrible Commentary. It's very badly stitched together and repetitive - in fact the 2001 commentary was FAR better. Plus, I've found that the sound disappears for 10-second periods every so often. - Killing/Grabbing Ball when defending a ruck - Apparently you can press Left/Right Alt to Kill/Grab a ball when defending. However, if you use a joypad, forget it because EA don't seem to have bothered mapping these keys to my Gravis controller. - The mouse is not supported for in-game menus. - Although the graphics display some good player animations, they're still very dated in quality. Any good points? Well, passing in open play is still good (though not as good as the 2001 game), and scrums and lineouts have improved. That's about it. Everything else about the game reeks of bad coding and a hurried release date (the World Cup starts on October 10). The old "World Cup Rugby" for the MegaDrive and "Jonah Lomu Rugby" for the PC proved that good Rugby simulations can be made. EA Rugby 2004, on the other hand, is frustrating to play, doesn't "flow" like rugby should and is terribly designed. I would say that it's nothing more than an embarrassment to EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is an insult to the great game of rugby. I'm just glad I bought it very, very, very cheaply, and that I can offload it to the ignorant and gullible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When you look at this at first you think that with such a tried and true concept, how could it possibly fail. Warhammer Quest is an astounding triumph of failing against all odds though. It looks decent enough and sounds good and it boggles the mind how it could have been mangled the way it has. For more on the ancient art of turning virtual gold into offal, read on!

Weird design decisions abound in this game and are one thing to consider when trying to understand just how bad it is. The camera keeps resetting the zoom to way too close. And it does this every time there is an enemy turn, which is basically every ten seconds the entire game. The zoom is in other words meaningless. And not only that, but it readjusts the zoom for each monster in every fight in completely nonsensical ways until you become dizzy from watching the entire spectacle. How such an amateurish camera control got past Q&A is a mystery.
True to this unpromising start, the designers also decided to add random fights, in addition to the fixed ones you unlock as you explore dungeons. Regularly these either take place far behind you with ranged monsters, forcing you to backtrack to kill them, or melee mobs just dump right on top of your ranged characters with no warning. In the first case I twice in just the second dungeon in the game had almost reached where I needed to go to proceed into the dungeon, when three archers appeared WAY behind me. We`re talking about six rounds of walking for the melee characters here. So off I go to kill them and thirteen pointless rounds later I am back where I started only to have the SAME DAMN THING HAPPEN ALL OVER AGAIN!!! Add to this that the archers shoot through things and the general mood is set for a good time in the dungeons!
In the second case it just makes the entire notion of tactics completely pointless, since mobs can drop on you basically anywhere. What`s the use of trying to protect vulnerable ranged characters when this stuff gets added to the game? It is another version of the skydiving mobs in Dragon Age II and just totally unacceptable for a tactical game. It is just unbelievable how such stuff gets past testing. So fifteen minutes of this and similar pointless nonsense pr dungeon is statistically the minimum you must expect, based on my experience. It is as if they were trying to drive players mad with all this stuff, and it is as if no one has ever before made a video game. And bear in mind that I have just started, and already the miserable design is absolutely shocking. I can only imagine what other horrors await for those masochistic enough to play the entire game.

But all this would perhaps be acceptable if it wasn`t for the appalling moneygrubbing by Rodeo Games. You get to start with four generic characters. A hunter, a wizard/healer, a barbarian and a sort of dwarf fighter. There are other classes, but lo and behold you have to pay three Euros to unlock each of them. And there are seven characters, totaling in at 21 Euros! Pay 21 Euros to unlock content for the game you just bought! The nerve of these people is just unbelievable. Needless to say no one should ever buy any of these classes, or any other DLC ripoffs for this game. And there are plenty, including a reprehensible gold shop. And sensible gamers know that where there`s a gold shop there will inevitably be a contrived shortage of in-game currencies, forcing players to waste real money for in-game currencies if they want to progress. If I didn`t know better I`d think Rodeo was a subsidiary of the masters of moneygrubbing over at Blizzard. It`s just that bad. A complete boycott is the only way the people responsible for this will learn. Consumer activism ftw! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Average Campaign, but annoying bugs ruin it. Multiplayer has terrible hit detection and I spend half my time being spawned out of the map thanks to Danger Closes terrible coding abilities. Worth renting, but you'd be a sucker to buy this. I can't believe this game has been in development for 2 years!  2.5/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, i liked most MOH 2010, but this one its totally dissapointing, the story telling its quite good thou, (if you are searching for story continuity or reading a book). Single player needs more action and more fixes. Its like a copy paste "omg! COD black ops its going out to the market we gotta rush!!".Why 2 points instead of just 1/0 because you know a nice story about those unknown fighters and multiplayer its kinda nice but you want more out of it... okay lets face its its boooring needs more movement more action, more design, and more levels. Finally dont buy it NEVER 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The feeling you get when playing MOH warfighter for the first time is “they can’t be serious??!”, this is in my opinion a huge setback that don’t bring anything new to the genre at all! I have always loved the MOH franchise, but this time I feel ripped off big time. AI is nonexistent in both your allies and your enemies, your allies will push you out from cover if you are on their designated spot and your enemies will come flooding from nowhere and take cover in the middle of the road..standing. The previous realism is gone and the game feels more like it should be sold with the Nintendo 1gen duck hunt gun and have automatic movement after the shooting is over.  It could had saved it for me if it gave a great 3d experience, but 3d vision support is not present and the game will actually freeze and crash if 3d is activated. I really liked MOH 2010 even with its limited AI, but this game got so bad after 20min gameplay that I just gave up trying to enjoy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

don't waste your money, the servers are deserts. Simply fps that have nothing of special, horrible and boring single player, laggy multy,buy other, there are games more beautiful 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a disappointment, I really have nothing good to say. I like the graphics and the sounds but thats it. The story is boring and repetitive. Seems like all the maps are based on each other, they are all boring too. If you played the MoH from 2010, you know what I mean. There is really nothing good about this game. MoH has gone in the CoD direction but with a little more realism and better looks. Still, a polished turd is a turd. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor game, this game was obvious rushed, but they had time to create the next map pack, the game is full of bugs and unbalanced  weapons if your thinking of buying this game DON'T!, they're not going to fix this piece of junk, you cal also tell they let console idiots beta test this game because the amount of issues it has. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For me this game is a defeat of the year, I had huge expectations through this entire EA marketing, but very much I was disappointed. This game just as well could not leave and nobody would cry, this game was created only for money. The only innovation is playing it in pairs on the multiplayer, omitting that is it is most ordinary FPS... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Same generic shooter we game every couple months. It Doesn't change anything, linear campaign and awe-full gameplay. Using the Frosbite 2 engine isn't making any better. It's like taking Battlefield 3 and creating a different story line. Very disappointed of what I got. I really liked the MoH 2010 and this? not even half of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a load of garbage, buggy as hell, laggy as hell, unbalanced as hell, cluttered as hell and unoriginal as hell..What the hell was happening in Danger Close's mind eh? This game just ruins the MoH franchise..The single player? What the hell is that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overall, just awful! What a pain in the a$$ to play… I’ve been a pc gamer for a long time (since the original Doom, around 1995), and AITD is just one of those games that was NOT designed with ease-of-play in mind. 1. The constant auto-swapping from 1st to 3rd person view is really annoying, [they could of at least created an option to keep 1st person on]… 2. Controls are ‘stiff and floppy’, which makes it difficult to align to many objects [causes it to be ‘unplayable’]… 3. The lock-onto-enemy is a cheap addition for a game [it just proves that the 3rd person perspective for this game is so cheap that they had to make an extra function just to stabilize the movement]… The only things enjoyable about this game are some of the game play features such as item selection, the graphics, physics, and special effects, and the nice frame rate (e7400  9600GT). I don’t recommend this game, unless you collect games in hope that one day this one will be worth some money… lol! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very crappy survival horror game, even for hardcore survival horror fans. There really isn't much else to say. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hell happened to this franchise? Alone in the dark was a classic survivl horror and was the basis of what would become the popular Resident Evil franchise, however, newer games with new ideas started coming out and Alone in the Dark was left out in the dust. Atari quickly put their minds to work and decided to resurrect this forgotten franchise but make it fit in with the new demographic of gamers by taking out everything that made Alone in the Dark great and adding in every sort of cliche in horror game history.

Gameplay is the biggest thing that's been butchered in Alone in the Dark as it literraly doesn't live up to it's name. You're not alone because there are tons of people that will follow you around at some point and you're rarely in the dark. You can play the game from a first or third person perspective but the controls for both of these perspectives are terrible. When in first person, your sight is limited to what you can see an you'll most likely get stuck on something and half the time, you won't even know what you're stuck on. In third person, the controls feel restricted and you'll struggle to pull of basic actions in the game. The camera is awful in the third person view because your mouse is terrible for controlling the camera and it constantly fights with you. I failed doing a certain jump near the beginning of the game and it took me 6 attempts to get right because the camera switched perspectives when I went to jump. There are a few gameplay elements which seemed like good ideas but weren't used up to their full potential. The inventory management is one of them. In game, when you want to look through your inventory, the game doesn't pause and you need to look down at yourshirt and actually select the items you want to use which is a great idea but, you might be shocked to hear this, the controls suck in the inventory screen. You will constantly try and navigate over to a certain item that you want, only for the game to take you to an item that you've never needed before. The game is also buggy as hell and some bugs will prevent you from proceeding with the game.

The story is that Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character wakes up shortly before he is meant to be killed by some men for whatever reason and the thing is Mr. forgettable and unlikeable main character can't remember anything about himself. However some weird creatures stop him from being killed and he escapes the building with a little bit of information about his task and he also escapes with Ms. Obvious girlfriend for unlikeable and forgettable main character. So the 2 go out and try and complete the task he's been given and also figure out who he is. By a horror stand point, this plot has been done to death but most horror games add a unique thing to it to make their specific telling of this plot memorble. Alone in the Dark doesn't. It literraaly takes the bear bones of a plot structure and uses it as it's final product.

Graphics are a mixed bag and the graphics is probably the best thing this game has going for it. Certain things in Alone in the Dark look amazing. The fire looks brilliant and it's great just to watch the fire spread across more of a surface. The game overall looks OK but there are quite a few badly textured things you will come across throughout playing Alone in the Dark. Sound is relatively bad aswell, mainly because some sounds are actually missing from th game, mainly in the SFX. Some sounds cut out randomly and for no reason at all aswell.

The game is quite short for a horror game and you can complete it within about 12 hours (my timer counter is broken for this, probably because my steam account had mercy on me and it didn't want anyone else to know that I had played this game for 12 hours.) There is no reason to replay Alone in the Dark either because there are so many bad things that are included in this that youwill not want to put yourself through this torture anymore.

This was meant to have been the great return of a classic survival horror video game series but instead we were left with a buggy, ugly and unfinished mess

Final verdict

Pros
+ Some great ideas
+ Decent graphics

Cons
- Awful controls
- Buggy as hell
- Forgettable story
- Unlikeable characters
- Missing sounds
- Some ugly textures

otro juego de mario y sonic? vale creo que si la empeoraron    no digo que los juegos de estos dos personajes sean malos ,pero no son muy buenas estas sagas  almenos sirve para divertirse con la familia... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No fun. Even all the 80's-90's reference that worth this 2 points. There are missions that you have to walk and shoot and they are horrible, walking control is worse than bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A horrific display of 1996's graphic capabilities. I was angry and sad when, hoping for an evolution of gungriffon blaze(Ps2), I wasted 50 bucks on this travesty which would be mediocre at 20 bucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is was just a poor effort of a game all around, it tried so hard to be good and like a superhero game such as prototype or infamous but the truth is the entire thing was a mess. Random events occurred constantly and if they weren't completed they would drop your 'goodness' level meaning the NPCs would dislike you. the missions were poorly designed too with not a great deal going on within them. Not to mention the graphics, they looked worse than the spider-man 3 game. Also bugs were rampant in this pile of rubbish, the game would freeze and random intervals and just made me stop playing the game and move onto something more enjoyable. Overall, Terrible, simply terrible 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just looking at the graphics of the game makes my eyes hurt. Why, oh why everybody thinks that 100% saturation and "special effects" with all colors of a rainbow all over the whole screen is nice? It's horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like being a sniper and this has bullet drop and wind to take into account. Except, it doesn't it works it out for you and puts a little dot on the screen. The first mission opened well and I was enjoying it, it looked ok the plot was bull but you get used to that.

Then I got to the oilrig mission, no sniping, just a badly implemented run and gun, and is it me or are the AI either brilliant or idiots? Amazing shots at huge ranges but dumb as a post when you shoot the bloke next to them.

Invisible walls and getting caught on the scenery didn't help. Neither did the semi-QTE's (shoot NOW!) or how the AI can hit you 300m away with an AK and you cant shoot back because the screen's shaking.

Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main issue with the game is that it's a bad shooter and that this portion is too big in the game.
On top of that it's hard to make out enemies when your mission involves killing 20 of them which are really angry and they hit you from 200 yards away with assault rifles, no problem.

The run and gun missions are the worst, you can't make out enemies because your gun blocks half the screen and it keeps spraying everywhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

didn't like the game at all . i am sorry for the 5$ i payed for it.
game is very slow and bad and not interesting at all.
i am a big fan of sniping but the game disappointed me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It doesn't seem possible for a bullet to drop 5 inches at 50meters for a high powered rifle.  Too many bugs.  Save your money.  This game is not good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

TERRIBLE game, a real shame as this could have been brilliant, the whole thing is just amazingly let down by tedious monotonous gameplay, graphics and story...yes I'm not terribly convinced by the film either, but thats another story, the only thing that lifts this game above the ZERO mark is the lovely music score that has made it into the game also... Not recommended, go out and buy the music CD instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible. It's slow, it's ugly, it's not a candle on Spartan : Total Warrior. The phalanx sections are the worst thing ever devised by the gaming mind, including such amazing moves as 'stab' and 'over-head stab' and the amazing command bar which, if it breaks, the phalanx shatters. A fantastic idea one might think until they see it go down to zero and all you get is the message 'You die, retry?'. What is this, a text-based adventure from the 80s? For a film which prided itself on it's production values, the game is a horrible abortion of an action title that would have been mocked if released on the Atari Jaguar, let alone the PSP... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a disapointment, their are so much better games out there,i.e. Dishonored, Kill Zone,Ghostrecon, and so on. Why programers want to make game that are not fun, too hard even on easy I do not get or want, how about a chllange But FUN???! dON T WASTE YOUR MONEY 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bummed. I feel like the kid that keeps touching the hot stove after he burned his hand the first time. From now on, good luck selling anything w/ the words "Medal Of Honor" on it, it has now become synonymous w/ mediocrity. The game wasn't even "rushed". 2 years?!? 2 years to make this game w/ a well known, often used & very agile engine. & this is what they came up with.... Trading....

The multiplayer is buggy, sometimes on respawn, you fall through the map which adds a death to your count. Damage is inconsistent @ best. Seems to take me damn near a mag to kill a guy, even when I get the drop on him, while the other guy hits me about 3 times & I'm dead. Other times I hit a guy 2-3 times & he falls dead.. go figure.

Single player was fun enough, kind of a lotta re do though. Too much time spent on details like the differences of how a GROM operative reloads a weapon vs. how a SEAL might & not enough on the polish of the experience as a whole.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game on release, and returned it the very next day. It really is that bad. On the back of a release like BF3 EA really could and should have done better. The campaign is marginally playable, and the multiplayer is pretty much the dullest online shooter experience I have ever had. This may have been patched or fixed, although I imagine most people who did give this more time went on to buy either BO2 or went back to BF3. This game is appalling. The only really positive point I can think of is that the game allowed you to have purple gun camo. That's it. Don't buy, it'll just end up as an expensive coaster. Don't buy it second hand either, come to think of it, as you need an online pass to play. Just. Don't. Buy. It. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could be a fun game on PC. But the combination of being hard to control and the fact you can't save until the end of each level makes going thru the same thing time and time again until you get to the part you can't get die then get to start the whole thing over again. I wish I could get my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is as bad as everyone says - in fact it is one of the worst games i have played in a long time. Combat is abysmal. Whilst RB wasn't outstanding, you could atleast move around freely, do combos and do a variety of special moves. In UT it is literally QTE QTE QTE... movement feels really restricted as there is just 2 'ranges' you can be in. The UI is confusing as hell and i found it difficult to work out how to do a special. There is no satisfaction from playing you just mash buttons and hope you get the right flip of the coin in the 'rock paper scissors' type clashes you get with the opponent. I didn't make it far enough through the story to get to a big boss battle as the combat is so dire and repetitive I had to stop playing.The story mode is poor. After doing the first mission of Bardock vs Frieza you are placed on Earth for the Raditz battle and can fly around the map (flying feels super slow btw, nothing like the TV series). Instead of going where Raditz was i went to the World Tournament that was also marked on the map as a point of interest. Suddenly i am placed in a tournament with the likes of Frieza, Cell and Android 18! So much for story lol.People have praised the graphics but i think they are worse than those in RB2. The edges are really shoddy and most of the time you can't see whats going on anyway because of the stupid camera angles and QTE.The character editor is very limited. The characters all look the same pretty much, you can change the skin colour to look a bit like a Kaioshin but other than that it's palette swapped Saiyans. I am not going to say Raging Blast 2 is an amazing game because it isn't. However I would recommend that over UT to any fan as UT is sadly complete tripe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I first played God of Thunder, I thought it would be awesome, but it turned out to be another movie tie in knock off and a very bad one at that. With clunky controls, bad story and tons of glitches, God of Thunder should be dropped in the bin, never to be seen again. At least rent the game. It's not worth the money 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It plays like a bad 90's adventure game:  a terrible interface (four clicks every time I want to use an item?  lolwut), no tutorial for the non-obvious controls, and puzzles so incredibly obscure and pointless that no one could possibly beat this game without a walkthrough.  And even when you DO figure out a puzzle on your own, you don't feel like, "Cool, I figured it out," you feel like, "Wow, that was stupid."

On the plus side, it looks nice, and has good music.  But that's about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward to playing Anna, since I love point-and-click adventures/puzzle games with a creepy atmosphere. However, apart from some really scary paranormal things happening, the game was rather disappointing.
It didn't bother me that it was quite short, but in my opinion, most of the puzzles were frustrating and pointless. I had to use a walk-through for the greater part of the game, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to finish it. To be honest, the whole story didn't make much sense to me.
Also, the controls are horrible - the mouse either moves too fast or extremely slowly, and using items from the inventory is too complicated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its alright for an arcade game, but i prefer more realistic drivin and sounds and graphics like simulators such as gran turismo 4. But it aint bad, gettin style pointsand i like just about all those mustangs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has good moves and each character has different unique abilities. However, this game is very difficult. Allies die way too easily, and some objectives are very unfair. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was horrible. 

No thought was given to the first 15 minute game experience. Camera and level design is a great example of anti-vision for a 3rd person game. HUD elements are completely confusing. Combat is seemingly random and unsatisfying.

And finally, dreadful, generic character design. This game was made by a team for themselves with no thought of the end player. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Play Monkey Ball 2 on Gamecube and then tell me this adds up in anyway. This version of the game is possibly the worst game I have ever played. I beat the main game in half and hour and the rest is so terrible I got rid of it immediately after. This is worthy of complaining to Sega....shameful and do not waste your money if you are over the age of 5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wouldn't have thought it would be that hard to make a reasonably fun Mario Kart / Crash Team Racing -like, but apparently it is. Even the basic gameplay of TTR:WT is lackluster. And that's about all you get. It's a missed opportunity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** this piece of **** game. 3rd race in only the 2nd league is nearly impossible to win even when using the best possible car at that point with all upgrades. Sad to see console games moving in the direction of crappy mobile games that con you into spending more real money to continue playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Controlling the cars are a complete joke in this game. If this is supposed to be a fun game, why cant you play it? The CPUs drive like they masters at driving while the player struggles to turn a car. The map design is so terribly bad that it will have you raging with sharp turns around every corner that will have you falling off the edges and getting into last place all the time. the graphics are really bad too so dont expect anything good there. At least the game works and was free on psn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was my first ever game on the PS3 and I tried my best to enjoy it, I really did. The upside was that the graphics were awesome. The downside was everything else. Level design was pretty atrocious. Weapons felt pretty useless. Camera angles were terrible and responsible for so many unnecessary deaths. This is possibly the only game I can remember that I did not finish. I wasn't even close. I even booted it up multiple times after my initial attempts at it, but I still had no luck with it. The game is rampant with artificial difficulty and probably not worth your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Du classique japoniais, balance des coups de sabre à droite à gauche et recommence, des fois donne des coups de katana en avant ou en arrière, saute, fais des pirouettes avec le stick droit... mais du coup impossible de contrôler la caméra qui reste fixe et mal placée la plupart du temps puisque c'est le jeu qui décide.

Pas vraiment ouvert, c'est un gros couloir entrecoupé de cinématiques bien niaises impossibles à zapper. Cela étant c'est assez joli, si, si, et on peut avoir les voix en japonais (toujours un grand moment de détente), c'est pour ça je lui mets 2 quand même. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I experienced this game at my buddies house and it was as bad as I thought it was going to be. Now, I don't hate Star Wars at all but the fact that when they were previewing it, the game seemed very glitchy and unresponsive at the best of times just showed a lack of execution for a game that should have been really awesome. The animations are stupid and clunky and the lag between your actions and the game is really bad. It was fairly obvious this game was not going to be ready for a long time but MC felt the need to release this game just to appease the masses. It's as bad as I thought it was going to be and definitely is not the game that is going to sell more kinects in the future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Kinect Star Wars is not for hardcore gamers and this is clear, is a game designed for the family and the Kineckt, but unfortunately was based on a franchise utterly distinctive.This resulted in what I consider to be a pure offense to Star Wars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Postal is a big joke. Not so bad that it is a joke, I mean it literally is just a joke. And you'd save more time watching it's flaws on YouTube than actually going to the store to buy this. Even if you found this funny, it's going to be extremely unplayable... and very forgettable. Don't buy Postal or it's follow ups.. It might just kill us all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have no interest in wrestling at all, but a friend lent me the game. Basically it's totally unplayable - nothing seems to happen whatever buttons you press. Truly dreadful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the first wrestling game ive bought and without doubt the last. This game is full of holes, load time, glitches in the video...and so on. It could have been polished alot better before release. Bottom line if you like being frustrated...rent it, but by no means buy it!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not only are the graphics terrible, the game play is no match for Links 2004. Even the price of renting this is too much! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fuzzy 2D graphics, very few hotkeys or in-game buttons, terrible screeching noise during battle. You almost have to see it to believe how bad it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In Short: bad voiceacting / dialogs, unprecise combat, absurd and unclear doging/blocking mechanisms or not even there (dodgeroll), unimersive world (when you put in your name everybody goes ahead and calls you vulcan). And some things more, which made me stop playing this game for the moment and once again showed that you should not prepurchase anything.

Some things extended: I guess coming from Dark Souls franchise, esp. the latest DSII which i played a lot, from the trailers and dev. interviews i expectet a "casual" Dark Souls and i was proven wrong. So the voiceacting, the dialogs, the graphics are not very good and the story is quite predictable some hours in to the game, but what threw me off the most is the "clunkie" combat, its not precice and feels unresponsive, meaning you take damage but you can not see or hear form where or maybe it was the smash to the ground 10 meters behind you which you didnt hear as well. So as said im used to hard combat but it has to be fair. Also the dodging/blocking mechanic is unpleasant, you can only jump back and block, but you have not a shield, whish there were more options and clarity on how to block / doge things. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game, while beautiful in some parts, is almost painful to look at in others. This is not only inclusive of the graphics, but of the lip syncing as well. That's just a joke, not to mention the dialogue is terrible to begin with. As for gameplay, it's kind of fun but there is very little variety in it. You primarily invest all of your skill points into the ranger whatever category because warrior is too slow and  you don't receive nearly enough mana to properly be a mage (your health and mana barely increase over the course of the game). Combine that with a fighting system where you repeat the same hit, hit, dodge, hit, hit, dodge, hit, hit, dodge pattern the entire game, it gets pretty tedious and boring. It's fun, but gets mundane pretty quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horribly clumsy combat, robot like movements, the same annoying sound at the beginning, and visuals that really don't represent next gen. I played about 2 hours and then put it back in the box and sent it back. The only reason i even scored it a 2 is because i rented it. If i had bought it, i would have scored it a 0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What to say? Simple horrible. The combat system is ridiculous cheap and broken, not challenging like DS. The animations, camera, lore, story, pathetic sexual content only help to bury this thing in a barrel of **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really dissapointed when I saw the score on metacritic. I was not sure if I should give Bound by Flame chance or leave it and finally I decided to give it a go.

The first impressions of game: The voice acting is really bad, optimization is also not the best tried to run it on ultra settings on high end PC and all I got was 20-40 FPS (which is a joke since I could run 2x BF4 maxed on my machine and still I would have some free resources), lowering few options from Ultra to High did the job and I got solid 40-60 FPS. The combat system in this game is just nightmare, it feels so uncomfortable not to mention that blocking enemy attacks is just nearly impossible and it takes ages to kill group of enemies even on LOWEST possible difficulty. Graphics are not bad but game looks ugly in some areas. Companions in this game don't do anything besides dying and trying to kill single enemy... in that case they fail too.

+ Graphics
+ Boss design

- Optimization
- Voice acting
- Combat System
- Lore
- Companions / Generic Enemies
- Difficulty levels 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring game with a bad voice acting, bad combat, story was so-so, main theme music is fantastic. Whats the point of entering your name or choosing a gender when nobody notices it? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've bought Ranko Tsukigime and i regret the purchase actually only for the game part. I completed the game on the first playthrough within 43 minutes +25 minutes cutscenes. The cutscenes were fun and the boss fights were interesting but paying 40€ for the game is way too expensive.
The animes were awesome. I enjoyed the 65 minutes from start to finish. So if you find the game for a 10er, buy it for the animes, not the game. Turned the game in for something else on the next day. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pro: Great story Con: Awful graphics, sloooooow, buggy, glitch and a lot more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are hardly any redeeming features in this game. The camera sucks, sounds have nothing in them, graphics is ugly, especially in the cut scenes, there are frame rate problems and the game becomes repetitive within the first fifteen minutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very very very very disappointed with this game. It might be set in the No One Lives Forever world, but has none of it's redeeming features. Yes, there is some comedy dialog, but not much. No cool gadgets like NOLF (although, they have left a couple of the horrendously difficult to control vehicles in... oh great... yay...) No real variety in the missions. All pretty much wading in guns blazing. And its way WAY too short (I finished it in about 6 hours.) I'm totally at a loss as to what they were trying to achieve with this bilge, other than cashing in on a well respected franchise. Monolith, you really should be ashamed of yourselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SLOW!>>>    It takes far too long to do a whole lot of nothing. I was hoping for a sid meier's pirates meets magicka. There is very little RPG elements involved and the combat is boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The quick review would be to say that it is boring and buggy, poorly though out and executed. I am glad that I only paid £7.50 for it, but even that was a waste of cash. Ship combat is dull and laggy, land combat is so poorly executed it is laughable - there are games from the 1990's with better top down combat and AI than this thing.. The game is also very poorly balanced, and has a poor soundtrack.

To give more detail, the game is very basic and very dull.. Alot of people were, like me, expecting a cross between Sid Miers Pirates! and a strategy RPG with more character dev and ship customisation, what we got was something that failed to do either concept at all.

You have none of the ship/crew management that is found in Sid Miers Pirates, the game play itself is basically boring mission after boring mission, most of which are land based "A to B" missions that involve walking a linear path with incredibly poor combat, and absolutely shocking path finding for the land units, which often get stuck behind obstacles.

All your units lump together into an almost indistinguishable mass on land, and there is no attack move button for your units, so they will basically run along getting hit. if you don't click on each enemy individually. If they are standing still they will attack a unit right next to them, but that is about the extent of it, no room for any tactics or strategy. As said above there are games from the early 1990's that have a more sophisticated setup than this piece of junk. On top of this you are always forced to run all the way back to the beach at the end of every mission, which is basically a waste of your life.. it can take several minutes on some of the larger islands and is utterly pointless.

The Naval combat is very very dull, repetitive close range canon spam abut sums it up. Unlike almost any other "Age of Sail" or Pirate based game, you do not have options for canon shot type, so no grape shot to whittle down the crew or chain shot to smash the masts and sails, just repetitive spamming of the fire button. The games poor balance is most visible when it comes to the ships, your starting ship is a floating tube, as to be expected, but it is easily possible to gain very early access to the larger ships, which basically own every thing.. combined with the ability to repair your ships even during combat, you would have to be an idiot to lose you ship, making the combat both boring and too easy.

Long and short of it is, do not buy this game. If you want a pirate game then go for Sid Miers Pirates if you have not played it, or Akella's Age of Pirates titles are pretty good if you install the mod's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most fans of the Carnivores series try to forget this game exists. They're not wrong to do so.
Cityscape was developed not by the original Carnivores team, but by Sunstorm Interactive, who developed Primal Prey. This is very apparent from the start as the style of the dinosaurs, the gameplay (right down to the "decaying corpse" mechanic), and the sci-fi style weapons are identical to what you'd have expected from a hypothetical "Primal Prey 2". There's very little connecting this game to the original Carnivores series, and whenever it tries to bring in the (very short, very simple) lore of those games it somehow manages to always get it wrong.
The biggest deviation, obviously, is that this is an FPS rather than a hunting game. Taking the connection to the original games aside, this still seems like a very bad idea. Cityscape does a poor job of competing with other shooters from its time, both graphically and gameplay-wise, and makes poor use of the Serious Sam engine. The game as a whole feels very lazy, with lots of bugs, nonsensical missions, gaping seams in character models and even a level where they didn't even bother to animate the water.
The game does offer the unique option to play as a dinosaur, but the concept is so horribly executed that no one in their right mind would ever want to. As a human, the game is playable, but laughably bad and very easy- big guns and thermal goggles ensure that you'll never be outmatched or caught off guard. As a stand-alone game it's mediocre, and as a Carnivores game it's even worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I spent the majority of my time with this game waiting for it to load! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well to tell the truth I wasted my money. The graphics are ok but the game has way to many glicks in it. To many times have we have had to restart the game cause it froze on us. We have the frist three and love them but this one was no good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was entertaining for a while, but then it was just monotonus. It seems the game makers were using their 'beautiful eye-catching graphics' to make up for this pathetic exuse for a platform game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

APB is a great and unique concept. Cops and Robbers in large open environments with the ability to make your own unique character and car. There's nothing really else like it at this time. That alone retains a strong player-base.

However... it is poorly executed.

Combat in the game is fast but not smooth. The developers seem to have taken the Unreal 3 engine and in an attempt to make it work with a third person camera turned the combat system into a jerky mess with mechanics that are infuriating at times.

Most of the weapons do have a weakness. The cash shop offers versions of these weapons with that weakness removed.

Matchmaking is also poorly done. A new player should expect to be matched up against max rank players with every possible weapon and modification unlocked. Players should expect to frequently find themselves outnumbered 2:3 with the other team having equal or better players.
Player's can also expect that opposition will exploit the games poorly developed mechanics to their advantage.

APB's community is horrible with little moderation; player's are encouraged by the developers to be disrespectful to each other.

The game's only strong point is the customization. As far as free to play games go, it is one of the most detailed. You can make a truly unique character and vehicle. This system does suffer from poor image projection and images used for decoration are low resolution and pixelated.

So sum it
Most people, including myself,  playing this game are waiting and praying for the concept to be applied to a game that doesn't suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is **** Before anybody starts flaming that I am noob or anything, I have wasted over 600 hours, 150$+ in this game and I am gold threat.
I first started playing this game about 3 years back. The max rank at that time was 195. I was in love with the game, it was so much fun at first. So I started getting into it. Soon I realised that this game was and is far from beeing balanced. I will cover EVERY aspect I hate about this game right here, so lean back and let's get on to it.
First: About 2 years ago the performance of the game DRASTICLY got worse. This is because (and APB offically admited this) they don't know their game. They changed a couple of codes around and **** up big time. They had no backup data whatsoever and screwed the game over completly. Irepairably. They want to fix it with an engine, but still it will take at least a year for this to come out. These lagspikes are crappy annoying as hell. If you are in a 1v1 fight you loose or win countless times not because of skill, but because of mini-lags that either you or the opponent has. A better computer changes NOTHING. It's just the way the game is programmed. This is fueled by server-lags. My record ping in one match was 1500 and I have really good internet and a download-rate of about 2MB per second. This is something UNACCEPTABLE. Most of the times the servers **** up, they could get better servers, even people offered to give away their gaming-pcs to be servers for this game, but for some religious reason or anything the APB developers don't accept that. Maybe it's too complicated for them to set up new servers.
Next thing: Weapon balancing. NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF THIS GAME HAS ANY WEAPON BEEN COMPLELTY BALANCED. The oca-Nano is still imbalanced as **** percs are crap, they now managed to ruin the Colby completly to render it useless and a SHAW > everything. I had bronze-guys kill me with a SHAW, why? Well, I came to them from behind started firing my tommy-gun and what do they do? They turn around slowly and POOM. Spray n Pray, kill. This game is about 15% Skill, 40% weapon choice and 45% hoping that the server doesn't lag. I had a pause of one year and this was the first thing I saw in this game. A year ago the same thing was with the Whisper. And it's still dang-strong. I  don't even wanna mention the ACES, this is propably the most ridiculous gun I've seen in the entire game so far. Kill time of about 0.000002 Seconds, without Spray n Pray to say the least. That **** needs such a BIG nerf.
Another thing that is still crappy: P2W. There is no REAL P2W but there is a: P2 be a douche, P2 level faster, Pay for EVERYTHING. The only thing missing is that you can buy the easter-special grenade launcher on ARMAS for 500$ and then I would be done with this game. The guns on ARMAS cost around 20-60$, depending on if ARMAS thinks it's gonna sell well or not. These guns are sometimes even ARMAS-only guns like the CR5 or the ACES. I don't understand why people think it's justified to put those guns on ARMAS only. And btw: The online-shop is the ONLY place in game where you can get a weapon for lifetime. Don't even bother wasting your money there, it's just gonna get you nothing!
Next up: Physics. Sometimes they are funny. Sometimes they are crappy as hell. No proper physics allowed in this game.
Now, my favourite part: Matchmaking. I get onto my criminal account (R141) and I get called as backup. I have a trainy and a bronze in my team, and then me, the goldie. Against? Correct: 3 Maxed out Golds. The game doesn't allow my team to call any more backup. So WP APB, this is a fair matchmaking. Couldn't be much worse, could it? They at least managed to get a proper definition of bronze-silver and gold through the points, though it's not really stable. I have a friend who switched from gold to silver and back for 74 times now, I am not ****ting you. This is so ridiculous. I don't even want to say anything else to that.
This game is not just that noob unfriendly if it comes to matchmaking. If you start the game first time you will get into a server, be on auto-ready and automatically recieve a mission. Noobs don't even know what missions are or they are too ****ing braindead to realise that they are not supposed to shoot the green-guys but the red ones. And most of the time noobs don't see through a ton of flashy stuff that they even GOT a mission. So WP APB again, noob friendly like a competitive Counter-Strike server for CS noobs.

Conclusion: Try it out if you don't think I am telling the truth. The first 100 hours are really fun to play. I started playing 2 weeks ago again and the first week was actually pretty fun to get used to everything and so on. But now, I am catching myself raging about all the **** this game still contains. And I haven't even mentioned mission-running or the cheat-system punkbuster which doesn't do **** and causes trouble at any give occasion. All in all, not worth more than 2/10 points. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The character customization was absolutely beyond anything I have ever seen in a game and the graphics are decent; so, as much as I would like to, it would be unfair to give it a 0. Yes. that's pretty much the only good I see in this game. I can trick out my character and car for hours on end, making it stand out from the rest; but what good is that if the game is unplayable 80% of the time? You're probably asking yourself, "What does that mean?" Well this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjn8Hm--eMk should explain most of where the problem lies - in APB:R's NetCoding and G1's Servers; it's complete ♥♥♥♥. I'll admit I don't have the best internet, but this game makes me feel like I would be less frustrated than if I were to have no internet connection at all - it's that bad. If you're not getting disconnected every hour or two, you're probably looking like this right now: http://imageshack.com/a/img843/1781/sw1u3.jpg
If you're lucky, you'll get a two - three hour "grace period" where instances like the video and picture doesn't happen (as often). And believe you me, that was one of the happiest moments of my life. Oh but it doesn't stop there..if this isnt bad enough, your first impressions of this game will be greeted by login errors and server crashes! Want more? Well here's something that will make you want to quit. You're in one of your "grace periods" and happily decide to K (ready) up for a mission in a bronze server. The mission starts and look who is on the other team..silver threat players. Seems legit right? Turns out all of them are deathreating gold threat players, happily stomping on your team because "Hue, dhers liek, noe 1 in da g0ld server, huhee.gg n00bz". What I found funny was that if all these deathreat rejects were to stay their threat and go into their own server, it wouldn't be quite as "empty" now would it? If that short little story was "TL;DR" for you, the basic knowledge floating around is the fact that the matchmaking is flawed; VERY flawed and the "good" players take full advantage of it. You'll see yourself facing players who are a higher threat and 100+ ranks higher than you - on a regular basis.

Cheers and good luck from Canada.

I played many games Free to Play. It is well known that there is no perfect game but this game is one of the worst games that exist in this world. Well the game has an interesting system of being a police officer or a criminal, we have a curious editor to create the form we have the opportunity to create their own clothing, graffiti, painting, car, etc. It looks quite interesting, and such is, however, what is fishing without a hook of the whole matter:

- Poor optimization game
- Sometimes textures do not load in time
- AI is just stupid
- Driving model is a nightmare
- Physics or rather the lack of it does not add charm but it is sometimes funny
- Shooting in this game is to scattering bullets all over the place
- Detailed texture offend poor quality, for example dashboards in cars
- Categorical bugs and errors game
- The prices of weapons, vehicles, etc. can knock on the knee compared to the cash acquired in the game
- Lack of balance first weapons that the player can earn are useless, hopeless modifiers as giving the player an advantage over the other causes that fighting is often for just the one player at a disadvantage
- Friendly fire is not bad, but when you are in one team with a complete moron who kills you or other members of the team without reason is annoying
- P2W unfortunately, the game pushes us to buy a premium to have a mass bonuses and buy items, weapons, etc. for real money
- Matchmaking is fatal if not nightmarish often looks for players who have experience are much higher, for example, the player with the bronze game against players who have gold

The game looks like an undercooked steak does not taste too good. APB is unfinished look like Beta. Terminally game is a waste of time, but has the potencial but which has not been used and is unlikely to be. This title receives 2/10 of me because I wanted to give willingly 0 but the game is not so broken to get 0 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1. Game is full of lags
2. Game is for pay to win ****
3. Enormus amount of hackers(especially aimbots and damage increase hacks)
4. If you tipe /fps in the square below it says you have normal ping but the game just lags and lags. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoy the GTA type games this will be right up your alley. Unfortunately, what at the core could be a very interesting, even clan based game, has been infested with hackers. Playing since beta, this game has consistently gone down hill. I will chalk this one up to full of potential but ruined by the community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've heard good things about this game and I've heard bad things about this game.  I'd have to say the bad won.  Several months ago, the game piqued my interest when I saw it on Steam.  I downloaded it and started it up without any problems...except the waiting took a while between each aspect of the game.  I liked the fact that I could customize my Enforcer, but to get any of the coolest-looking accessories and other stuff, I'd have to go premium...which, sadly, the game wouldn't leave me alone about!  Then came the gameplay itself in the chaotic city of San Paro.  The game at least works, I'll give it that, but not much else does.  The first complaint I have is that the only permanent weapons you have are very basic and very weak; everything else in the game isn't permanently unlockable because you can only *rent* weapons for only ten days at a time.  If I was a Criminal, why would I want to rent a weapon when I can just steal it and keep it forever??  And no law enforcement agency in the real world EVER rents its stuff out to cops for only several days at a time.  Oh, there's also something else about the guns; damage is the same all around.  With locational damage being nonexistent, I've had numerous instances where I riddled a guy in the face with bullets...but he lived because he was wearing *body* armor!! (no headgear, body armor) There's no rhyme or reason to hurting other players with the guns if there's no locational damage to increase or decrease the pain you deal out.  Now to the players themselves.  The player community is probably just as bad as Heroes of Newerth, if not worse.  There are hackers everywhere, the common being aim-botters, trigger-botters, or both (for people who don't know, a trigger bot shoots the gun for you if you simply pass the crosshairs/reticle over an enemy player, usually used in conjunction with an aim bot).  The so-called "premium" players have shelled out real money to get the best weapons the game has to offer, which a good number of them aren't even available to free players for that reason only (again, more annoying advertising to get people to buy a premium account).  Plus, judging from other reviews here, PunkBuster is a complete bust.  There's pretty much no consequence for hacking or cheating while there's a small chance the system will randomly pick a legitimate player to ban for being a supposed hacker.  The missions and matchmaking are also poorly conceived.  It's really a race to see who can camp at the objective first, which usually goes to the highest-leveled players and hackers.  Frequently, I found myself on a team with other similar-skilled players only to be randomly and unfairly matched against players of a much higher level.  Frustration followed as we kept getting beaten to the objective every time and the only break we got was when the objective (usually the very first) spawned close to our location, causing the enemy team to race halfway across the city to find us.  The mission variation is very bland and repetitive, recycling the same goals over and over again.  "Open-world" in this case is very deceptive because there are a very limited number of buildings you can enter, and even then most of them serve as being nothing more than shortcuts in on-foot chases.  The developers assumed the name "GamersFirst" but they are anything but.  Every patch that comes out does very little to fix the game, especially the biggest flaws that people repeatedly complain about.  It seems G1 doesn't really care about the players as they implied with the name of their company.  Overall, the most fundamental aspects of an MMO just aren't there: the matchmaking sucks, the missions are bland and repetitive, the plot is completely bare-boned with no development whatsoever, locational damage is nonexistent, and the anti-cheating system rarely works on legitimate players only.  APB: Reloaded has some merits to it, but it doesn't make up for the rest of the game, which is a stale, boring, and broken rip off of Saints Row.  I very highly advise anyone thinking about picking up this title to simply steer clear of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very nice idea, however with an idea alone you just don't make it sadly enough.
While fun to play with friends, the game starts developing issues like repetitive gameplay and a lack of good quality content.

There is a reason why they couldn't keep up with the idea of "Pay to Play" and "Free to play" is not going to help this game to get any better.  Also, the idea of Premium is getting a bit annoying because you get to see if everywhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having recently started playing, I have no idea about the past issues of this program, but I can see it has very far to go to be considered a game, its completely unbalanced, connection issues, and the biggest problem it has is the rampant number of players using the Punkbuster aimbot hack in game. That alone removes every bit of the fun this game could acheive. I for one cannot fathom what enjoyment someone could get out of having to cheat to win at anything, guess it speaks of upbringing but thats their problems not mine. That said I dont feel the company is doing enough to address such issues being as its free 2 play - Pay 2 win which is an automatic fail in my book, sad too because this "game" had so much potential to be great but when the cheaters are paying the bills nothing ever gets done about it. graphics and all that are really good but a moot point when gameplay is critically broken. All in all at this point its realy nothing more than a hanout for cheats and hackers but its not alone in the online game community where lack of skills can be fixed with a hack. Give it a try but dont expect anything phenominal and dont plan to get serious about the game it lacks in the player quality area mosty but the best thing about it is you can try for free and in my opinion free is all I would ever put into this my two cents is really more than its worth.  Free 2 play / Cheat 2 win Failure....... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did. But the issues of instability, rubberbanding, FPS dropping to single digits even when I can play this game at 60 FPS easily, and a playerbase that's perpetually angry drove me away.

Planetside 2, a horribly optimized game runs better than APB:R. Now that's saying something. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game for a while in Beta before i just utterly got bored. The character creation is very limited, and as I like creating my character close to what I have in mind, it was pretty much impossible with the narrow and bad graphical design of features.The games routine is pretty much "Get a mission--> Drive to the location --> Fire your weapon at enemies ( who are impossible to kill as some have hacks and macro. ) --> Go to the next point --> Same again, all until the mission is over, with the last stage having some element of fun left in it.Now, Imagine doing the above paragraph perhaps 200 times. One word "BORRRRRINNGGG". Yes, the first 100 times are fun to some, but after 'the fun level' rapidly decreases, you will do what I did, and move onto something else.When you complete the missions, you gain money which you can go to the social district and buy cars, clothes, change your looks etc... But with the update a few months ago while allows you to gain half of what you would have got, it takes weeks even months to get decent cars. So if you want to spend your life on actually doing a good few hundred missions to get one of the best cars in the game, then go for it. But I guarantee that your time will be wasted as you feel completely sick in doing the same missions over and over again.It's not all bad though. Of course APB:Reloaded has some...very... bad points, they also have some good points. It is a really fun game to play with friends and team members. On the other hand, a group of friends ( more than 4 ) can't play with each other because the max you can have in a team is 4 players. Nevertheless, it is fun and playing tactical and talking on Teamspeak does make the game more fun to play...for a little while.I hereby score this game 2/10. At the first hour I played it, I would have scored APB around 8-10, however that number started to decrease after I played maybe 20 missions.I wouldn't let my enemy play this game, it is that bad overall. This is by far the worst game I have played  and I really would advise anyone who considers playing this game to consider it very seriously indeed, as it sucks your life away like a giant leech. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun game, but developers only care about paid players, not free players. Why the game is F2P, who knows....I played the Original APB and the Reloaded, both were fun, but miss the point and only focus on certain player bases instead of the whole community. Game should be shut down forever.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

APB Reloaded has some redeeming qualities, such as the so far unrivaled amount of customization possible for characters and vehicles, but shoots itself in the foot with its asinine pay-to-win style of gameplay. You start with an assault rifle that can barely hit anything beyond 20 meters, and a revolver that can't seem to hit anything, let alone kill something. There were times that I was playing in deathmatch and lost only because gun was incredibly underpowered compared to the other guys gun. If the other player had played for a while and unlocked the gun as a result of becoming better at the game, then I would be okay with that. But this is where the game falls flat on its face: If you want the best guns, the creme de la creme, you have to spend money on it. There are some guns that you can "rent" for free by gaining the trust of contacts, but the most powerful stuff is reserved for the people with the deepest wallets. After looking at the online store, the average price for a weapon seems to be approximately $6 USD, or 500 G1 Points, to have a weapon for 30 days. If you want to keep the weapon forever, it costs 3500 G1 Points, or about $42 USD. That's right, to use a weapon whenever you want, you have to pay the same amount you would for Portal 2 and Counter Strike: Source (Two GOOD games, by the way).Overall, this game has potential, but I would rather see it as a standard game, where you pay for the game, and unlock better weapons as you become better at the game, rather than just buying your way to victory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games ever! Bad graphics (uses Unreal Engine 3, but the graphics s*cks), really bad physics, car driving is a nonsense. It's using too much memory (usually needs more than 2 GB so do not try it with a 32bit OS), lagging extremely. It's a bad GTA/SR multiplayer clone, nothing more. If you want to play a game like this, try out a GTA or a Saints Row game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are outdated (and worse than present on the 360 version) and the controls are even worse. The reliance on using 2-5 keys at the same time is bad enough, but tack on requiring mouse input for certain commands to the issue of any mouse motion AT ALL disabling your camera lock, and you just have a serious control mess. The complete inablitity to remap the keyboard is a throwback to games of fifteen years ago. On top of this, graphics are poorly rendered and poorly optimized, resulting in horrible lag at the MENU screen. The only redeeming features are voiceovers from the original captains and the fact that the dogfights CAN be fun for the first couple hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has got a lot of hype, you watch the video demonstration of the game and think 'Bloody Hell'. But once you have parted with your cash, take it home, switch on and start, you begin to think you've bought the wrong game, Hell mine crashed on the first go. So after resetting i managed to start the first mission, following a squad car, now the graphics are very good, but the control method is pretty inept and the cars drive pretty crapply. I'd hate to get to the missons with with full blown shoot out's, i think you'd have more hope running around Iran with a British/American Flag. So this game only scores 2 because of the graphics, but nowadays that should be the norm. After that awful experience i will look forward to Full Spectrum Warrior. But for rehabilitaion back to good gameing I'm off to NES for a bit of Super Mario 3, Yippe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the junk? This game is messed. I bought it opening day thinking that it would be something great. And I blew like 70bucks. There is a crapload of bugs in it, and its just junky overall. Rent first before buying! But on the side, Ninja Gaiden is a great game, buy that! hahaha.. lol 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

People saying this is the best game they have ever played, obviously have never played any good games. atari games are getting worse by the minute. DO NOT BUY IT 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know who is going around giving this good ratings, but don't buy into it. I was a huge fan of Driver 2 and this game has got to be one of the biggest let downs of all time. It hurts to play, its so bad. What a waste of time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Make sure you can put up with the technical and gameplay issues before parting with hard earned cash. Also think twice about buying this anyway as you could end up encouraging this kind of exploitative game development in the future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Decent Graphics bad gameplay. Can't say i'm surprised that a korean mmo is a grind-fest. If you want to grind play RO it is a much better game, Zero real quests, no story to be seen. The game feels the same as it did in beta, nothing was changed. The chat filter is horrible, the chat system all together is horrible. The kill/quest system is bad also, it only awards the kill to the person who got the final blow, so in your party you have to kill the same mobs exponentially compared to the number of people in your group. Of course we can't forget the potions! This game is a potion spam fest, you literally have to AKF mine all night to be able to afford the potions for the next day of leveling or grinding PTs. Last but not least is the killstealing, (just like any other korean mmo) is highly irritating. People can snipe your quest mobs off by a well timed hit and steal the entire mob you spent 100k on potions to kill. There is one final thing, thats the lack of skills. As a ranger you have 1 attack skill till 30.. Yes 1! 2 buff skills and thats it for 30 levels. Talk about boring. I recommend you not play this game unless you are an avid grinder, go pick up EQ1/2 or Guildwars they are both better games. Not to mention this game is $15 a month! $15 for this game should be a crime! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good looking but boring and tedious, you can tell that this game was created for the korean market because its just lv grinding with a tedious battles. the european markets want more story and a reason for being in that game world. the other big problem here is that you have to subscribe to this drivvle,, take my advice and go and get Guild Wars instead( online MMORPG with no Fees) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Believe it or not I love mindless killing ( grinding if you like ) i have a life so logging on and getting getting to the point of lvl'ing and or pvp'ing is just fin for me...but...

In addition to the above comments. You cannot change your mouse sensitivity, you need to hack the game to change your keyboard setup... and worst of all this game does not have Inverted mouse and there is also no way to hack it to do so.

If you require any of the play styles i stated above and love PVP or RVR whatever you want to call it. going into pvp/RVR with a unconfortable keyboard setup is pretty much a a waste of time... you end game would be to go to RVR land just to die!!!!!!!

stay away from this game.

seriously the game DEV's as well as the so called beta testers are really that ....( fill in the blank ) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found it to be rather low in quality overall.  Every element from graphics to gameplay just doesn't stand up to today's production standards.  Tedious combat, sub-par PvP, terrible community.  After playing to 35 in the UK/US beta then going to 25 on a friend's account we both decided that time would be better spent watching paint dry.  Stay clear if you are looking for a game with challenge or depth.  Players 15 years of age or higher need not apply. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buy this game if you like mindless killing of the same creature over and over again to see marginal gains in your character Buy this game if you like to run your computer 24/7 in the game having your character automated mining. Buy this game if you like your PvP to be reduced to whoever brought the most potions winning. This game is a complete waste of space on the MMO Market. While good looking, that's all it has going for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed with this one. Games are very short, and rather boring. The lack of a quick reset feature or a practice mode really drives the rating--dull, dull, dull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My 8 year thinks its fun, I think its about the worst game we have. Really boring and unstable...actually crashes our console...we have to pull the plug to reboot. I'd avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, i decided to give this game a chance. I mean, i like Jeff's work. He made GoW, do i need to say more? He also made Twisted Metal, an awesome game as well. So i download the game and first thing i noticed: Another game that wants to give that "Punk" vibe feeling...I have nothing against this, but it's not something really original. The last game i played like this was Sunset Overdrive...
Anyway, i select tutorial and start to play. Now, keep this in mind, i am someone that likes to joke on other people...a lot. Even though i know how to keep my bearings and i never offend other players online or anything like that. This might sound like a stupid statement, but really...i kinda got bothered at how frequently the game tries too hard to treat you like an a**hole. Calling you names (even as far to offend our dear and beloved mothers) and it just felt...weird. It gave me the impression that i was playing a mod or something made by an 14-year old that just learned how to swear at people...
Anyway, the gameplay it's solid. A lot of different weapons and special abilities from different characters, but again...how is this something new? People that experienced games like TF2 or Overwatch are well aware of different characters with different abilities and such. not that this game is like any of these games i mentioned, they're not. But still...nothing really original. The weapons, though varied as they are, makes me feel like i'm playing Sunset Overdrive, which, in turn makes me feel like i'm playing Ratchet and Clank...And i DEFINETELY prefer R&C over any of these games.
After finishing the tutorial you can choose your character and customize his loadout and etc. however the game doesn't really give you a lot of explanation on how each character differs from the other besides some brief description with their special abilities and their Cons and Pros against other characters, so you'll have to test them by yourself and figure out how they play, which is not a bad thing...i think.
Anyway, i finished the tutorial, chose my character and went to play online. Spent 2 or 3 min waiting for someone and the game puts me with other 2 players...i didn't really care about that because i thought it would be a free-for all match...but i was wrong...
The game puts me in one team - The Blue Team - and puts the other 2 guys together to fight against me.
......First match ever, in less than 20 minutes that i'm playing the game and i'm already playing Online against 2 other dudes that pretty much rekt me over and over and over and over again...
No one joined my team mid-session because, as far as i can see there's not a lot of people playing this game online. That was enough reason to just quit the game and stop playing.
Drawn to Death isn't an original game, nor it is funny or fun. It's a below average Third-Person Shooter with good but shallow mechanics and unexciting gameplay. Thankfully (or not) i got this game for "free" since i am (for now) a PS Plus member. Apparently SONY was aware of how average this game was to the point of throwing this at our face with this month's PS Plus free games.
Once again Sony is treating us like idiots, maybe more so than a frog that constantly calls you an "Idiot" and a "D*ick" in this game when you play the Tutorial Section. I can't help but feel like i am truly an idiot, for spending my time downloading this abomination and for giving SONY my money for a whole year of PS Plus.

+ Art-Style is interesting. Nothing really exciting, however
+ Solid gameplay mechanics, even though they're not original at all
+ Weapon types are quite varied

- Simple and shallow game-modes
- Repetitive and boring gameplay
- Do i need to be called a "D*ick" "A**hat" "Idiot" and "W*nker" at every 30 seconds? And worst of all, by the game itself and not the players????
- Uneven matchmaking that will definetely troll you more than the game itself
- 2 vs 1 in my first match is not something that gave me a good impression of this game

I'm being honest here. Don't buy this game. If you're a PS Plus member then give it a try, but i'll warning you: You'll likely regret it. Stick with your Battlefield, CoD, Uncharted or TLoU...
Fanboys will surely hate my Review and Score...i couldn't care less. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pro: It's for "free" this month on PS Plus

Con: Artstyle unique, but dreary, controlls are bad, animations are bad, time to kill is way to long, some weapons are useless, microtransactions, maps way to small, just 2v2 and 1v1 modes, gets boring after a couple of hours (1 - 3), getting keys takes to long, humor is very bad (e.g. insulting the player), the whole game is unbalanced.

Even for free i can only say "don't waste time and downloadspeed for downloading this game!" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i don't know what to say more, but i few lucky because i don't spend money on this trash!

full of bug, low poly character, after kill an enermy with headshot, thier animation will be "dull", and when you walk close the the "headshot-ed" target, you will see surprise!

sound like ci games try to copy alot from the other games(ghost recon, sniper elite,...) than make thier product have something special!

P.S.: what for crack from CPY and finally all of us can fell the pain in the a** from this trash!

good gaming y'all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A buggy mess of a game. No idea where the 10/10 reviews come from other than the developers themselves. You are much better off playing Sniper Elite 4, it's still not a 10/10 but it's at least a functioning game. This is barely ready for Steam Early Access. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sniper ghost warrior 3 review

Completely misses the mark

They say 3rd times the charm. Well not in this case. This whole game is a complete mess. It saddens me because I was really looking forward to this game but after playing it I'm so glad I chose not to purchase it. There are just way too many issues with this game. The AI is inconsistent, loading times are terribly long (can take up to 5 minutes or more to load into the game) low textures and texture pop in all through out the game, bland graphics (the first two look way better) bad draw distance, empty world, laughably bad crafting and looting elements, terrible parkour even the gunplay can be a chore. it's just a complete mess of a game. It feels like it should've been an early access title. It kind of reminds me of homefront the revolution. That game was near broken and terrible buggy at launch but later it got fixed up where it actually became fun and playable. I hope sniper ends up getting fixed up but even then it still would be a pretty mediocre game. Right now it's just a bad disappointing game. I can't recommend going to buy it especially not at $60. I can't really recommend it at all. Maybe if the developers work on fixing it's issues It could become better. Right now though it's just a bad game. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the first game I've considered trying to pursue a refund for. It plays very stiff like a playstation 1 shooter. The controls and options are very un-intuitive. There is no indicator of who is an enemy. Apparently, I killed an enemy, and the only way I knew was when I viewed the scoreboard later. If there is a vote on your team, you are prompted to vote in huge text that covers a third of your screen. There's a squad concept, and you are prompted to stay with your NCO (lead officer), but no indications of what that is doing for you. The "tutorial" is 7 sentences. Save your money, this is a developer still learning to make games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously, this game is f***ing garbage. A game should be fun, and this is so not fun it's totally not funny.

I'm a huge military history fan, I've been sightseeing to every battlefield of the great war, watched every movie/documentary and been to every museum in Europe. I've also been playing games since I got an Atari 2600 in 1983. This game does nothing good. Nothing whatsoever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hardware rival is an online exclusive game. There is some local matches that can be played. The overall experience is poor if you are new to the game you are still going to be fighting players with better armor, and veteran players at the start, which immediately takes the joy out of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its impossible to move your character, and it took me several tries just to beat the first level, in fact every level i had to redo multiple times to pass. its way to frustrating and the controls are terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

From a player who grew up respecting Nintendo's sensibility, to me, this game is an all-time low.

The playstyle is self explanatory; it plays like any Bejeweled ripoff possibly could, aside from your ability to completely overlook wherever each piece is located and move them in a free range of motion. You're limited to a certain amount of moves, and those moves are replenished via in-game currency bought with real money. Now, this would be fine with any game that was targeted toward a more adult audience (i.e. Game of War, Clash of Clans, Candy Crush, etc.) but, think about the target audience here.

Little kids with too much time on their hands and probably not connected to a bank account with which to do as they please.

The game is easy at its start -- you get a starter set of five hearts, which replenish one at a time after a span of thirty minutes. Five rounds in, you get a jewel. Five more rounds, you get another. After that, you're on your own, because, lo and behold, the notorious check-in button appears. Legendary Pokemon that you can catch become available. But, before you touch that continue button, keep in mind that this is a pay-to-play game, and, if gamers have learned anything from EA from their days of hashing out DLC, it's that we are always seen as wallets for the big bad boys of the gaming industry to stick their grubby hands in.

Though, I had kept the completely innocent image of Nintendo in my head. They'd never do that! They saved the gaming industry from those who did that exact thing!

I was wrong. Nintendo is doing exactly what screwed over the industry in '83. In order to even get through the fight with Rayquaza, I had to use all thirty moves (plus five more via a booster. And I had upped my attack as well), only to deal a third of damage to the damn thing. At any situation like that, an adult would be able to discern how much **** that is.

Let's keep in mind that it's mostly kids playing this. Would an average kid not just grab his or her parents' credit card, load up on jewels, and grind the damn thing?
They would. They **** would.

Thanks, Nintendo. You might be the reason the industry is screwed over in the end. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is fun, but the constant attempt at getting money from microtransactions is upsetting. I would pay $10 for the full game, but I refuse to pay the microtransactions. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cash grab for a mediocre puzzler. We have seen this type of math game before, and while the mega evolution is rather fresh, being able to only play 5 times for every 2 or so hours, unless you pay of course, makes the game not worth the download. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's not free-to-play, it's a bloody pay-to-win. Lack of options is appalling: it's impossible (it seems) to turn off very silly tips showing up every now and then.  Apart from that, it's a fun game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played a LOT of fighting games in my time, and really, this is one of the worst. I understand that this game is supposed to be realistic, calling back into the days of Bushido Blade on Playstation One, but really it doesn't have that feel.Now, the show is my "guilty pleasure", it's nothing I watch for it's scientific merit (which is good, cause it has like none) I watch it to old style weapons used, and the carnage they do. The game is supposed to take that feel, and run with it, but it really doesn't. The biggest issue with this game, is it's control. There are just a TON of things wrong with it: first off being how loose the game plays. Your movements get so far with a slight push of a direction. And since you don't auto face your opponent (a crime in 3D fighters) if you back away, you leave your spine open to attacks. Then even trying to face your opponent can be a chore in this game. Attacks often are sluggish to respond, and take a while to finish. And heaven forbid you miss a combo, you're stuck in that animation until it's done. The graphics are also an issue. Really, this game looks only slightly better than a PSone game (at the end of it's run) so, really, I've seen games look a lot better, with a lot less. Look at SoulCalibur also for download, it's graphics run smoother, and look better. The sound doesn't fare any better. Voices go from bad, to just awful. The Samurai's voice actor sounds like he's recording it in a closet. The Pirate is actually one of the worst voices I've ever heard. And the others, basically just are generic. And the music isn't better, well, that's not entirely true. The music can't be better, because there is none. Now for a fighting game, not to have music, is unforgivable. There's absolutely no reason not to have music at stages. All there is, is ambient noise, and the awful grunts of the characters.But really, you can get past bad control, bad graphics, and bad sound, if the game play is good right? Well here, it's not. Damage is so much in flux, and characters die so quickly, it's hard to even have fun in this game. Characters like the Viking or the Spartan can kill a character right at the start of the round. One shot, done. In my time playing this so far (beaten arcade 3 times, and played about 20 online matches) very few matches last longer than six seconds. This is not good for a fighter. You never truly feel in control of a match. Combo's are pretty well unneeded. You'll find one that does high damage and spam that over and over until the match is done. With it's poor targeting, and the high damage, it really is a chore to play this game. One of the nice things about Bushido Blade, while you COULD die in one hit, it rarely happened. But this game, it happens rather often. So, what do you do? Well, you hope your spear does an instant kill, and repeat the same combo over and over and hope you win. Really, I'm starting to ramble here. This game had potential, and reading some reviews I got the game, and now I regret it.

Does McFarland need money? Are there famous baseballs yet to buy? This is a shamefully bad game about a great character. I don't mean to pig pile on this golden turd, but it really is bad.

I very rarely rate games low. I am a programmer as well as a games (from board to role-playing) enthusiast. It seems that these make me FAR more patient and understanding than the average video gamer. At least it always seems that way. Be this as it may, I had to take the time to come here and vote this game with what I feel is an accurate score. It is bad beyond excuse. I am more than willing to put up with game annoyances (GTA combat is horrible, but the rest of the game mroe than makes up for it, other games are terribly difficult but their save/check point systems offset this). This title, however, has so many that there is nothing good to get out of it. First, the camera is bad. This would not be all that terrible, but when it is coupled with an aiming system that is also terrible, it makes the game nothing more than a die and retry after you learn where the enemies are. I am no graphics hoe, but the very lame visuals are another nail. The voicing is not bad, but the script is so silly and weak that it comes across as less than mediocre. There are invisbile walls every where channeling you into a very linear path. The missions are short and shoddy (their shortness is actually almost a benefit with how close to unplayable it is, at least you don't have that far to go to get through a level...) All in all, I cannot recall being this disapointed and frustrated with a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game is so crappy . i love tank games.. but there is maby 2 or 3 good tank games that came out and this isnt one of them at all... good for kids under 12. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A game that looked to have potential and a lot to offer fails to live up to any of it as it fails to work half the time and other half it just is not enjoyable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a depressingly generic platformer that provides no compelling reason to play past the first level. There is at least one between-level mini game whose sole purpose is to fill time; I had more fun doing my taxes. The single bright note: the soundtrack is actually pretty good but this is by no means a saving grace. Stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You don't get a score any higher than 2/10 when the controls are so bad that it makes the game unplayable. And this is for PS4??!!! Good grief... For a "simulator" this guy has got to be the worst surgeon on the planet.

The controls are LAUGHABLE. Everything is unbelievably accurate - from picking up instruments, to actually using them. Your hand usually gets in the way of your view so you never have a clue what you're actually cutting at. They could have fixed this by making the hand transparent, but nope! They don't offer the option to invert the right thumbstick. Good luck pulling half of the organs & bones out of the patients with the horrible controls! Besides how ridiculous it is to simply pick up utensils/organs, you can't even properly use half of them - Scissors? Nope. Markers? Nope.Tweezers? Nope. On/off switch for power tools? Nope. And good luck once you don't properly place a tool back down onto the table with pinpoint accuracy & precision - you'll never be able to pick it up again!

Any game from the Trauma Center series for the Wii puts this game to shame. You don't even get to cut open your own patients - they come pre cut open and all you have to do is wave some flailing utensils around inside them until you either fail the mission or somehow actually manage to cut the right organs. As far as PS4 games go, this is a joke. It's a shame too because games like this can actually be really cool if they're done correctly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Game Revolution review sums it up: this game is for series fans only. Very bland and stale, and even the characters seem to know it, cracking wise about how much more they can take of the whole thing. Frankly, they got the easier part: it was all I could do to bring myself to actually finish it, and I derived very little pleasure from it all. This is more of a franchise-milker than a video game, so unless you're a super-duper fan of the series, do not touch this with a ten-foot stick. Aren't games, after all, supposed to be _fun_? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring. Nice graphics, interesting balancing, but combat requires nothing apart from an initial tactical composition of your army. And is then repeated way too often per mission - combat is slow-paced and incredibly boring. If you want a HoMM-clone that is unique and challenging and refreshing, you would do much better to look at the King's Bounty installments where combat is fresh and fun.
Facit: Boring combat, poor storywriting, stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is full of bugs and other technical issues and despite this it still could be pretty enjoyable if not the ridiculously retarded AI. Enemy's actions doesn't make any sense at all. Both in strategic and in tactical modes AI acting like the devs have forgotten to teach it how to play.Not worth a buy.

Disciples III may be the most polished turd in the history of gaming. Beautiful artwork on the menus, decent hand-drawn backgrounds, might have you believe you are about to play a quality game. You might even start to believe it when you open up the build screen and see more pretty artwork and a selection of ways to improve your army and your minions. The crushing moment comes when you have your first battle and realize all you do is click on the bad guys... your creature comes up in to rotation, left click. That's it. That's the game. There is even an auto mode that saves you the problem of having to left click at all, you can just watch. And watch you will because there is no way to speed it up or exit the fight. You'll enjoy countless hours of watching your entire army get slaughtered, one tediously slow animation at a time. Or maybe your army will be super powerful and you still have sit and watch these painfully long boring battles; (where you do nothing remember?) because everything has over 9000hp and requires countless rounds to slowly whittle down 10 health bars. I don't think I've emphasized enough that the entire combat system consists of left clicking. Your dude hits for a set amount of damage be it range or melee and you can choose which enemy to attack. You can also move your units on a hex grid but there is usually no game benefit for doing so. There are no damage modifiers, or spells you can choose; you can't even directly heal units. Your only options are choosing movement or which enemy to attack, how is that even considered a game?When you get to the part about upgrading your armies you can choose a few small trees of modifiers called buildings. Each one you own can have an effect on your armies, but there is nothing you can tangibly control during combat.The bottom line is that this really isn't game. As a player playing a video game, I want to be able to make some sort of choices that affect the outcome. There are no meaningful choices in this game because you spend the majority of your time watching an automated process. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is TERRIBLE. How the hell they could ruin such great idea of Disciples 2  all we wanted is same Disciples 2 with new graphics, new plot and new campains, and what did we get  Very buggy and weak HoMM-style clone with stupid plot and awful voicing. Why the hell they even spend money to produce such rubbish 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just plain crap. Don't waste your time and stick with WinningEleven / PES 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a huge fan of the show and naturally I rushed out and bought it on release day. A definite waste of $60.00. I couldn't even read the captions because the print was so small. The bad thing is, I went to trade it in a 2 weeks later and the price dropped $20.00. Not a good investment. I suggest a rental only. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

-SCAM ALERT- -SCAM ALERT- -SCAM ALERT- -SCAM ALERT- -SCAM ALERT- -SCAM ALERT-

Pay $20... then discover the $100 worth of DLC available. ROFLMAO. They got my $20. I'll be damned if they get any more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My brief background: I've been a gamer since the 1980s, a PC gamer since 1991. Though I'm not a hardcore fan of Tolkien, I am a fan nevertheless  I have a lifetime subscription in Lord of the Rings Online after all. Also, I play LoL and DotA2 regularly, having played HoN in the past as well.
I wanted to like this game, I really did. Seeing as it is a console port, I had next to no expectations of it, but even these almost nonexistent expectations have not been fully met. One of these expectations was to be able to customize my controls and graphics options. Even though I didn't need to do it in the end (I have a good enough PC and I'm more or less used to the control scheme they went for here), I expect a PC game to allow me to adjust at least those two options. I mean, look at Dust: An Elysian Tail  a godlike 1-man indie game that had come out on consoles and was later ported by the same one guy to the PC in an EXEMPLARY fashion.
It's sad, really. The game itself seems like an interesting entry-level DotA/MobA/whatever set in a great world, with familiar protagonists and nice enough graphics (except the portrait art  what's the deal with disfigured hand-drawn portraits of faces I am expected to know?), reasonable in-battle mechanics focused on immediate action and base upgrades instead of picking the right item build and farming money to afford it, and offering enough metagame complexity in the form of runes and gems to keep those more demanding interested  if played on a console.
On the PC, the experience is extremely disappointing. What's also disappointing is the monetization model: Dozens of dollars for the game, still requiring micropayments/DLCs or weeks of playing afterwards to be able to afford most of the basic/mandatory stuff? Again, maybe on a console (LMAO  Forza 5) where the game is reportedly decent, but who the hell would subject themselves to this on a PC where the market is extremely oversaturated, with the genre's pinnacles being readily available, even  free to play, and incomparably more user-friendly (with enough players playing them to actually play with/against)?
I spent good 3 hours on this game, which is 3 hours more than I should have, because that's 3 hours I could have spent playing all the far better PC games I have, including LoL and Lord of the Rings Online, both of which offer an almost infinitely better experience than this game does. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

P2P connection makes lag common place.  The game itself costs money, while around half of the available champions ALSO cost money, so purchasing the game doesn't even unlock the full game.  This game should be free to play.  There are no cosmetic upgrades for characters.  The ONLY positive about this game is the ease that it plays with a controller.  Overall much better MOBA choices and much better LOTR games. Buyer beware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would rather to get paper-cut between my fingers than playing this game more minutes than I have. If you think it might be good because its Tolkien's creation, oh boy...think again... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst MOBA, that i play. The best thing in this game is cinematic intro. But others? Gameplay? Terrible. Graphic? Terrible? And 56526561431351 DLC.....Dont buy it! Save your money. Really. If you want play MOBA, play games as Dota, LoL, Hon and maybe Smite and others. But this one...? No Sauron must be so angy and maybe kill creators of this ♥♥♥♥. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a MOBA game "based" in LotR. I know you might be thinking about trying this game because it's based in LotR. It's not even worth that. It's ugly -graphics are from 10 years ago-, it's sluggish -loading screen runs at 10 fps, in-game has occasional sluggish, has horrible gameplay and controls -one of the worst I remember-, interface is one of the less intuitive and slow in any game. Looks like -and most likely is- an unfinished game. And on top of this there are plenty of other MOBA games WAY better than this one. LoL is definitely very far from this  game -sorry for the swearing but there's no other way to describe this mess-. Stay away from this "game". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is ridiculous, looks like it's in a alpha version. The game makes me think in a refund in Steam!!
If you love your money, wait some months more! Let's see if developers releases some news.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have been playing this game since its release on xbox and the game is amazing. once i heard it was coming to pc i was stokd and could not wait to play it. the day came where i got to play it and i am very unimpressed with it. the gammy is laggy as hell, all you get is bot matches and unless you have a super pro PC you cannot play it due to the game not having any kind of options to change graphics (auto set to max). the only way to help performance its to play in window mode or to lower the resolution (which makes the game look like poo.)

for people wanting to play this game i suggesting buying it on consoles where it works MUCH better than pc. At least until a fix comes to pc which probably wont happen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Many many bugs big letdown the graphics are truly awsome and the same with geological layout such as vegetation and buildings. But the scripting is poor so many places you cannot go such as the bank,beaches and jungle's maybe im to much of a potc man, but it would improve the game significantly and so would a patch that would solve all bugs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In their rush to say "look, we're next-gen now!" the developers seem to have forgotten to include the game along with the graphics. Like in the 360 and PS3 versions, the creation suite has been destroyed, with most of the custom animations gone along with custom stories, finishers, and even music. Somehow the current gen version has managed to go one step forward and not only remove that but also custom arenas, belts, and female CAWs. But at least the last-gen versions have matches in them. There are over forty match types that were present in 2K14 but are missing in 2K15. There have been more match types REMOVED than actually exist in the game. There's a reason this game was review embargoed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are great. Gameplay is soooo sllllooooowwww... Buttons are on delayed response, so i'm yelling at the TV "punch, dammit!" while hitting the button 12 times in a row waiting for the slowest punches ever. I'm glad they give you the option to turn music off in the menus, tho! It can take like an hour to create a wrestler, and I don't want to hear the same 12 songs fast-paced songs looping, so rather than mute my TV for parts of the game you can turn off music in the menus only, and leave the entrance music as-is. Great! They should stop trying to "recreate the WWE experience" and just make a fun wrestling game. Every great game needs a good character creator, and this one is better that it has been, but the organization is just silly. Go in to one menu to create a new character, then go in to a completely different set of menus to create a moveset, then assign it to that character, yuck! Also, OCD I realize, but i you want to create a modern appearance for a wreslter, you have to clone it and take up an edit slot, so now you have the same wrestler in two spots. Want to have a title match, but use that John Cena you made in nWo gear? You can't because the belt is on the OTHER John Cena in your character menu. Same for "retro" versions of a character, why have them in separate character slots? Just put all the versions under one character, and let me pick the look after I've selected that character. I haven't been able to stop playing FirePro over the years because its fun to play, and only take a couple minutes to set up and finish a match, WWE 2k15 isn't really... fun... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing. $ 8 for a 1 hour and a half game. He tried to be an Ico, but does not compare. Really to easy to finish. What you think if you buy a game on Steam and only 1 hour of 'gaming'? Its not fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game can be summarized in one word: WHAT?!

Knock  knock is a (supposed) horror game. The protagonist, an hermit (for lack of a better definition), spend his sleepless nights guarding his house, which dark corners are a menace to his sanity. A great incipit, right? Except, not really.

The story doesn't make any sense. Most of the plot it's too scattered or too vague to scare,  with reference to mysterious games or rituals, mysterious  guests, mysterious  visions, mysterious (again,  pages of a mysterious diary of a mysterious protagonist in a mysterious place. Is it mysterious enough? Maybe too much!

There isn't an explanation for anything, making the player take wild guesses on what is happening. Is the lodger crazy? Is the house hunted? Is that monster real? Is the world real? Is it a nightmare? Unfortunately, nothing will be explained. Well, almost nothing: other things will have two or three possible explanations (you know, 'cause why the hell not!). Why? Because mysterious!

Who cares, the gameplay is awesome, right? ...right?

The gameplay is just shallow. You spend time in an house waiting for the dawn to arrive, trying to avoid monsters and other nightmare-ish  stuff. Problem is, the monster A.I. is non-existent. It feels so random to be caught by a monster that it doesn't even make a difference to hide. Some time you will lose without even knowing what got you, and how. This is extremely frustrating.

There may or may not be a sanity meter (explanations? Nah. Who needs them.) which declares game over if empty. And it doesn't fill up. Just not. And it isn't even present in the beginning of the game. It just pops up. Because, why not, right?

Graphic wise, the game looks really god, with 2D background mixed with 3D walls and space, which is a real pleasure for the eye. And it's the only reason you may play.

In the end, you may like this game for how mysterious it is, OR hate it, for how mysterious (and shallow, and random, and non-sensical) it is. Your choice.

The 2004 Spiderman 2 for the Playstation 2 and Gamecube had the best movement system for getting around an open world of any game ever (counting the fast-running of Saints Row 4, the glide/hookshot of Batman:Arkham City, the high jump/wallrunning of the Hulk/Prototype series).  All they had to do to make a great sequel would be to base more, better missions around that movement scheme.  It is pathetic that in 10 years no other Spiderman game has come close.  I got excited for The Amazing Spider-Man 2 because I had seen videos of them "improving" the web-swinging (i.e., restoring it to S2).  But the end result is dissapointing, a game that is worse than the 10-year-old S2 on almost every level.  In case anyone with the authority to make a Spiderman videogame is reading, I'll explain why.
Most of the problem comes from the way they have simplified everything to make it easier.  For example, in TASM2, you don't die or take damage from high falls (unlike S2);  In S2, it was easy to get slowed down unless you timed everything properly, which made it fun to try and race across the city; since there are no consequences (not evern slowing down) for swinging poorly in TASM2, it's not fun.  The wall-running is accomplished by continuing to hold the web swing button (in S2, you had to consciously let go of the web line and press the "wall cling" plus "run" buttons); it's how the Assassin's Creed system of auto-jumping to make parkour easier has actually made its platforming much less fun than the Mario64 system of actually pressing a jump button.  And speaking of, you can no longer jump in between web swings, or wall-jump back and forth between buildings in TASM2.  They took out (or failed to code) all the options of S2 that made you feel in control.
Also, the physics in TASM2 feel wrong, like you're moving at a constant speed.  The physics of S2 were alot sharper, like you were a weight at the end of a pendulum, moving with real angular acceleration.
The one improvement of TASM2 in web-swinging is that there's a separate shoulder button for left and right web strands, which does work better than having the one web-swing button of S2.  But that one improvement does not compensate for everything they took out.
The combat of TASM2 is much worse than S2, and it wasn't that great in S2.  TASM2's combat is a copy of the Batman:Arkham Series' (or any recent Ubisoft game), minus the near-perfect "feel" that only comes with repeat playtesting, minus the different kinds of enemies that have to be approached differently, minus anything new at all in any way.  S2 had a better system: instead of a "counter" button, there was a "dodge" button, that you then followed up with different options (attack or web-grab).  S2 also let you web-grab, hold, and throw enemies at each other, which was pretty fun in a "Minority-Report-Everybody-Runs more-of-a-toy-than-a-game" kind of way.  My main gripe in S2 was that enemies would randomly block your web-grab attempts without visual indicators of when you could and couldn't grab an enemy.  In TASM2 your only option besides "punch" and "counter" is a web-shot attack; there's no way to grab enemies outside of an automated pre-animated finisher.  Again, S2 wins out over TASM2 in terms of combat.
The stealth is functional but uninteresting.  Enemy AI is as simplistic as it can be without being broken.
The segments where you play as Peter Parker are pointless, boring, and unskippable.  I can't imagine how they managed to publish TASM2 without anyone pointing out how much better all of those bits would have worked as (SHORT) cutscenes instead.  Yes, S2 had Peter Parker segments, but they lasted like 5-10 seconds, and even then they felt pointless.
The graphics of TASM2 are average (so, better than S2), and the animations are better, but the characters no longer have rag-doll-physics; game creators, take note: physics always, always, always make the game look better in motion than just having more raw polygons or high-res textures.  So even in terms of looks, the 10-year-old S2 still wins out over TASM2.
S2 was not perfect.  There was alot more S2 could have done with missions to take advantage of the movement system (i.e. actual character chases with AI instead of just get-to-the-checkpoint-in-time), the submissions got repetitive, the combat was a little simplistic and the plot was insipid.  TASM2 has fixed none of these problems and actually (by comparison) made the web-swinging and combat much, much worse.
TASM2 is not average.  A higher-resolution verion of S2 without other improvements would be "average," i.e., the least-they-could-do.  TASM is just a major dissapointment.  It doesn't matter if it's an improvement over TASM1's web-swinging, this is just not acceptable.
And incidentally, the metacritic-tampering (perfect ratings posted by people who created their accounts the day of release, writing in obvious marketing language?) was pathetic on every level, though it didn't influence my score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I already supplied a relatively in-depth analysis of this game, but it's simply no good.

Everything was relatively acceptable minus the temperamental controls, the somewhat shoddy animation work with characters when speaking....but this stupid business with the Task Force and the "Hero" meter, is simply not acceptable.

If you get this game, and I seriously pray you don't, you will find that if that Hero meter points to anything close to the first red bar, you will get hounded constantly by Task Force machines whilst trying to swing around NYC. I have never in my life played such a terribly unenjoyable "open-city" game - and this really does the Spider-man franchise NO favours whatsoever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is great...if you're not nostalgia-blind. I went into this game pretty much blind, and I heard how good it was from both sides. So here is my analysis of how much of this game I was actually able to sit through.
-The dubbing and animation of this game is god awful. You could say it's because it's dubbed to Japanese, but this is a remake. There is no excuse.
-The voice acting is even worse. There was no effort put into it, and it is cringey at best. (Fun fact: Sega mailed the voice actors their lines with absolutely no context, so yes, it is not just an opinion that the voice acting is bad)
-The controls are so weird. If you want to interact with something in any game ever, what do you press? You press A. In Sonic Adventure, you press X. Why. Not to mention, if you try to interact with something, and you're not brushing up against it, X will also make you do an impossible to control spindash, that can't be canceled, and will put you 30 miles away.
-The camera is so horrible. If you are fighting a boss (which are also boring and incredibly tedious in this game), the game might decide to lock you in a camera angle that cant be changed and is impossible to see with. Also, the triggers change the camera. That's okay, right? Wrong. The camera controls are inverted, and can't be changed.
-The levels are mediocre at best. The action stages are apparently the good part of this game, but unfortunately, that's only 1/6th of this game. Also, in those stages, sonic is impossible to control, he magnetizes to the walls, and there are countless glitches that will do nothing but make you lose lives. In the remake. And I'm not even gonna start with Big the Cat...
-All in all, don't buy this game. I mean, I emulated this game (on Dolphin, probably the most fluent, functional emulator in existence), and I'm still disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I need to do something with this game that I haven't done before: and that is reconsider my rating of a bad game.  Originally I gave this game a 1.  Which, on the basis of stealing Diablo I's game play, ambiance, and design, it deserves.  For more than even Never Winter Nights I, it is obvious how much this game is "borrowing" from Blizzard's game, and that is something that simply annoys me.  The lack of LAN play was something that made me immediately hate the game, because this is what I bought it for.  But then I realized that this was an old hatred based on preconceived notions that were extremely disappointed.  I wanted a new RPG, and it did not deliver.  I wanted to play with my friends and my brother on a network, and I could not. _____  This game lacks variety.  The bartering system lacks balance.  Even the storyline is mediocre, at best.  I had to replay the game recently to see this.  And when I did, I saw that the game was actually fun to a degree.  In this -- it is challenging.  Which is more than I could say for Diablo except on Hell or Nightmare difficulty (in reference to DI, not DII which is a more advanced game and thus is on another level).  I would never, however, recommend you to play it simply because it is repetitive.  Extremely repetitive.  There is SOME variety, granted.  But it is Diablo I without the firewalls and lightning.  It's lasers, which is neat until you realize the different abilities differ in color and damage but not in effect or actual physics.  Mines and "CAMS" are there, but only depending on the race.  Which, is really limited.  And believe me, you are probably not going to enjoy this game enough to want to play through the exact same story twice. ____ I had fun playing this game when I was drunk.  So based on that, I increase my score 1 point.  I detract that it is the worst game I ever played, but I also detract that it had a good story.  It is a sci-fi scrap book story really.  I am not going to "spoil" it, however.  How "Harbinger" is symbolized in so many ways in the game is in fact the coolest, and deepest thing about it.  But this is where depth begins and ends, I am afraid. I recommend avoiding this game.  However, if you come into contact with it I recommend buying it as an artifact due to its rarity, if it is cheap that is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game does nothing to move forward the music game industry. It does nothing to compensate for the fact that it was released months after Guitar Hero 5 made leaps and bounds in this genre of video games. Besides that, the game has no narrative to compel you forward nor does nothing to explain Van Halen's significance to the music industry or anything. The game is also inconsistent with itself in the song choices, since the songs that were chosen do not at all relate to Van Halen's musical style nor their influences nor how they influenced the music genre. The only reason this game gets a 2 is because it has "functional" game play and some "decent" song selections. Still, no Van Hagar, no import, and no hope of future DLC for the game make it completely unacceptable. Do not buy this game unless you have just way too much money on your hands and do not mind wasting money on a game with some good songs but more than half of the set list is bad.

It's NOT GOOD. It's NOT worth half the money. You can't be serious if you rate this a 10.. it sucks big time. It's a major dissapointment, an huge anticlimax after all the waiting. No brilliant detailed graphics at all (everything looks terribly pixelated), the controls are terrible and the camera's rigid. All the cars drive the same (they all have the same saggy suspension that's fine with american cars, but not in place with smaller european vehicles) so the driving bit feels terribly dated. In fact *everything* feels dated. It feels like Driver 1 and it looks like driver 1. I guess they never intended it to look good on PS2. It feels and looks like a very bad PC-port. They should have spent more of the huge advertising budget on PS2 optimalization and learned from Rockstar. Shame on you, Reflections and Atari!

I found this game one day at 5 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is bad in so many ways... and to try and explain them away by saying it's not intended to be a good story or the best shooter is ridiculous.  Here's some reason why it's awful:

- Way too similar to the first one
- Graphics so jittery it gives you motion sickness with the water effects
- No real changes to combat just a few new weapons
- All missions the same
- Glitchy to the moon... You'll see zombies fall through things to outright missing physical hits practically point blank with weapons.  On one mission I was trying to find the last few assaulting enemies and the dots would spread away every time I headed toward them.  Eventually I realized they were stuck on a roof and I had to run outside of the safe zone to get them to drop and attach so I could finish them off

I played this all the way through anyway to see if anything at all was nifty about it and the only real cool part (IMO) was the ending fight with the last boss.  Other than that it was pretty cruddy all the way through and I had no interest it trying to get all the acheivements.

Since none of my friends kept it (used return policy at EB to get rid of it pretty much full price right away) I can't comment on the multiplayer part of it but I would never go back to it to bother anyway.

The first one was worth a shot and had a bad story but still made a fun time.  This one makes me head for gravol.  Avoid and if Grandma gets it for you for your birthday avoid her too.

Un gros copié-collé du Dead island précédent sans aucune amélioration, ce qui s'avère rédhibitoire à ce stade tant les mécaniques de jeu sont foirées et foireuses : combat au corps à corps nul à chier, aucune munition (pourquoi des compétences liées aux flingues dans ce cas ?) gestion de la fatigue exagérée et des armes qui s'usent 100 fois trop vite...

Pas mal de soucis d'interface également et une partie technique très moyenne (ça rame sensiblement). Comme dans tous les jeux de zombis, on s'emmerde rapidement : un genre maudit en attendant qu'un jour, un développeur se sorte les doigts et en fasse enfin un jeu drôle (l'espoir fait vivre).

I have been playing Nether since early December, 2013, and currently have logged more than 1200 hours in the game. Through the evolution of the beta version there was great transition and tribulation. Many players were dissuaded by the lack of support in curbing hackers from entering the game and putting regular players at a disadvantage. The outcry to curb the hacking and cheats fell on deaf ears and to this day the practice exists openly in the game with some players boasting about their hacks to the game. Many of us urged the developers to create a version where you were not killing other players, but focusing on the Nether only. The game did morph into a split version, one PVP and one PVE. There is a third game possibility called Last Man Standing which was an attempt to allow players to challenge other players in a version of "Who is the better killer."

Over time the development company has apparently sold the rights to the game to a third party, who in turn have failed even basic maintenance and have made no effort to enhance the game. Thus the number of players have dwindled significantly. Logging into the PVE servers is a major problem as many of us cannot connect to those servers. The Nether support is quite the joke. The web page technical support is blocked by IE 11 and Mozilla Firefox as unsafe. Forum discussions go unnoticed and basic upkeep of the game functions is lacking in almost all respects. Occasionally they will reset a server and things will work for short periods of time before dwindling into glitched Nether characters and lack of collectible assets. It is sad to see a game that was running upwards of two dozen servers to now having only a few and only a handful of diehard players, of which I consider myself one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I first purchased Nether during its early access period and thoroughly enjoyed my experience for a while, the bugs we're excusable as it was a "Beta" and the game play was mostly solid. I met a group of players which eventually became one of the largest clans within the game, [UTO].

I ended up putting just under 500 hours into the game total, the enjoyment dropped as the many games bugs remained undealt with and the developers focused on adding new buggy features against the communities wishes of fixing old content before adding more. The developers repeatedly claimed that the game had VAC enabled anti-cheat software, which turned out on multiple occasions to be untrue. Being a lack of Anti-cheat the game quickly became full of hackers. Slowly servers filled with illegitimate players, starting with just the occasional one or two. But eventually hackers we're an everyday occurrence which drove many players away, until myself and the rest of my clan could take no more and found other games to play.

All in all the game had great potential, but with a development team that both lies and doesn't seem to listen or wish to act on the cries of their community, I don't see this game going anywhere fast. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holy crap, what a terrible game! Take an outdated version of the old Counter-Strike, add in a little bit of environment destruction, include the frustration of spawning all the way back at the end of a map after getting camped by two guys behind cover, and you've got Breach. There's nothing fun about this game. Save your MS Points and pass on this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was hoping for an arcade Battlefield 3 and well, I didn't get it.The visuals I will let slide due to the fact it's an arcade game and cannot compete with retail games but when they said it had destructible environments I was hoping for a bit more then I got. The guns 's do look pretty good but the shooting is a whole other story. Don't get me started on the bad matchmaking, the game needed a lot more development time and to be honest a better developer. The game could have been a good FPS but poor controls and the simple fact it brought nothing new to the table stop it from even leaving the starting line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not sure you all had played the same game I did, since this was less of a game and more a test of patients and general tensil strength test for your Wii remote as you try to snap it in two out of frustration. I liked this game alot at first, controls seemingly worked well, blowing up planes is alot of fun and all but I began to notice I was losing control from time to time. Sometimes I would be pitching the remote up and my plane was in a nosedive spiral straight into the ocean, taking some quick manuevers to regan control. I'm surprised more people didn't talk about these dead zones, I made sure nothing was around me to interfere, I moved the sensor bar forward I even stood closer to the screen but I was still htting these dead spots which would either send me straight down or just cruising in whatever direction it had been going before incountering the dead spot. maybe this was a bug that had been fixed by a patch since this was months ago I played this, but these problems are just inexscuseable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game starts with an unfunny, seemingly endless dialogue that climaxes with a puking scene, then goes back to more boring dialogues. And I'm already out of here.

Warning: The ratio play/watch is lower than even in a Telltale product, which I thought was only possible in 1980s Japanese games.

Besides, the only actual playing I was allowed to do, combining two objects, was so stupid already that I can't be bothered. This is one of the weakest adventure games to ever step pixel into my monitor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful camera, repetitive and lazy level design, boring skill upgrade system, so many bugs and glitches, confusing story and stupid AI.

This game is a cash grabbing, with lazy designed DLC, selling the same costumes & hairstyles already available in the game WITH DIFFERENT COLORS!

What a waste of time! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me explain why the score is so low. (And yes, one of the reasons I'm writing this is in the hopes that the developers will read it)
I have always loved brawlers like Streets of Rage, Final Fight, any Turtles game, so I had great anticipation for this game.  As always I played on Normal.  I don't mind difficult games or even games where I have to repeat an area after dying, but this game was aggravating.  Yes it gets difficult after the first few levels, but it also get frustrating as new enemies are introduced and the high learning curve that it takes to learn how to beat them causes many of your deaths. Then on top of that you ALWAYS have to start back at the beginning of the level losing all your kills, score, and stats that you accumulated.  Most gamers who like brawlers/beat-em-ups do not mind the thumb-mashing repetition.  But when it happens as the result of poor enemy design, and poor health mechanics, that is just old-fashioned frustration.
Then....the nail in the coffin:  I consider myself to be a casual completionist (I know that sounds like an oxymoron).  I don't have to collect everything but when I see alternate paths, I usually like to have the option of going back and making sure I explore each of them.  In this game, when you see a split, it is usually because one path leads to the bonus star, and the other leads to the level's end.  As with a lot of games you can't tell which one is which.  That is fine, but once you choose a path, a force-field goes up and you cannot backtrack.  On level 5 I took a path and saw just a little ways up that if I took the other path, I could get the bonus star.  It would NOT let me go back.  The only way to get back there is to literally replay the level.  This is just lazy game design as the Xbox One certainly has the tech specs to allow for an entire 2D level to be held in memory.
My apologies to Rimlight.  The game is cute and could have had the potential of rating a 6, 7, or 8, but these MULTIPLE issues make it an effort best forgotten.  Try it if you get it for free but that's all.  Avoid it if you have anxiety issues.
PS: Not much better on "Easy".
Thank you.

One of the free Xbox gold games for February. I was excited to see that it had couch co-op! But that's where the excitement ended. Only took one hour for my friend and I to throw in the towel on this game.

We wanted to like it, we really did. We don't mind the retro feel and the simple mechanics. But the fighting was just so unreliable. You couldn't adequately defend yourself in combat. No matter what approach we took our health was constantly being drained by some bot shooting us while we were battling one of his friends, or the new bomb dropper enemy who seemed to be allowed to break our combos whenever he felt like it. If it weren't for the near constant health vials we would never have made it through a level.

As it was we only made it as far a the 4th level before quitting. By then we realized it wasn't just bad fighting that was the only problem. The powerups for the skills seemed broken. With two players in the game we were doing our best to share the loot evenly. But this meant that after the first level was over we were never able to fill our reward meter high enough to earn any more points to put into our skills. And we were exploring and smashing everything in sight. It felt like the game forgot that when two people are playing you have to double the rewards. So there we were fighting harder and harder enemies using our basic skills....no upgrades. Bad design...

The final straw for us was when we hit the laser beams on the 4th level. I died trying to make a near impossible leap over one set of double laser and of course my body lands right underneath one of the lasers. My friend had no way to revive me. If he came close to me to try the laser would just zap him.

My advice to xbox gold members...don't even bother downloading this free game. It's a waste of space on your hard drive.

Updated on June 8, 2017

While the latest fix did manage to make matchmaking much quicker, the gameplay boils down to "same **** different match" - a lack of variety, if you will. Until there is content to convince me to come back to this game, I'm done with it.

Note: Original review is based on the game state as of June 3, 2017.

To state it simply, this game is very much a hot mess.

The good

When one is actually able to get past the (still) tremendously long wait times to join a game session and actually play a round (or hopefully more), the game itself is actually good. The game itself is a 1 vs. everyone else, where the one is Jason and everyone else plays as the camp counselors. Many of the counselors are in the game, each with their own stats that affect survivability. The same goes with Jason, having different versions from some of the movies and each version having their own stats and weapon.

There are currently only three maps, but each one is faithfully recreated from the movies. The counselors move in and out of the cabins by either the doors or windows, and can lock or barricade a door to slow Jason down. Jason can only enter through the doors, but can smash down doors that are locked or blocked. This requires several hits and Jason plods through the hit sequences.

Whether you end up as Jason or as a counselor determines how you will win. As Jason, kill the counselors, and be as creative or straightforward as you want - and use your Character Points to unlock more kills. As the counselors, survive by any means necessary - escape by car or boat, call the sheriff and escape by meeting up with them, or try to kill Jason (which requires a lot of coordination with the other counselor players). The counselors can use their Character Points to roll for perks that can be applied. Each perk has a positive and negative trait that affects some aspect of your character's stats as long as that perk is assigned to that particular counselor.

The bad

This is where the game craps the bed. There are a lot of issues that have been outstanding since launch. For the first few weeks, there were login errors that were due to "the database not being able to handle the influx of players that were playing the game" (according to the devs, they only planned for ~30k players and they ended up having about 75k players trying to log on to play). The dreaded Cannot Log In banner was the result. A later update from the devs stated that they were able to scale up the database system, but some of the player data was corrupted and required manual interventions to fix it for the players affected. This is an example of piss-poor guestimation used by devs and publishers to determine certain online feature systems in which a bad guess costs them.

The most egregious issues still standing are lag and inability to join game sessions. This breaks down to two items - server bandwidth capacity and server capacity, respectively. There is nothing like waiting 15+ minutes to try and join a game session just to either keep waiting or something else happens and you get kicked back to the menus. I've been in a party with a friend trying to join a game and either we sit and wait forever, or one or both of us are unable to join the game session we were launching in to. FIX THIS ALREADY!!!

And LAG, sweet Jesus the lag. The lag can be bad to the point of near game breaking. In one of the games I was actually able to play, I was Jason and on two occasions in the same match I went to grab a counselor (and did) but couldn't perform a kill. I was stuck grabbing the counselor and the only way to get unstuck was to walk in to the lake to force a different animation (I was fortunate to be close to the lake). TWICE this happened!

If you miraculously manage to get in to a game session, and the host leaves the game, you get kicked back to the main menus. Why does this not look for a new host from the list of other players in the session? This is not a new function to multiplayer games, so join the party already!

The ugly

It's become apparent that the devs bit of a lot more than they could chew, and now they are desperately attempting to fix their mess to appease the gamers to prevent them from abandoning ship. The constant social media messages of "We're fixing it" doesn't cut it. I get it, game development is hard, but if you aren't up to the task then don't bother.

Verdict

Until the developers truly fix the issues with this broken game, avoid this travesty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A Disgrace that slapped my face! First of all most of the time i couldn´t even connect to the online services so the game was unplayable. The few times I could find a lobby, which took me an average time of 10 minutes, I experienced a couple of disconnects, several glitches and partly game breaking bugs. Frustrating. Besides that you have to consider that the amount of content is very low (3 Maps, same beginning cut scene and same ending cut scene all over). So this game is far from finished and when you can´t even convince with content it should at least run flawless. I mean it´s pretty much delivered like one of these Ubi Soft titles, but seriously at least they do look good. The first game ever, I consider about getting my money back. Don´t get me wrong I see potential here but realization is more than sloppy. The price tag is very ambitious with 40€ and the game definitely can´t live up to that. Even if they fix the bugs, I can´t see more than a 15-20€ game here. But bottom line (once again), don´t release unfinished games! I doubt that this game can recover from a really bad first impression...

UPDATE:
After two weeks not much changed here. In fact my experience was even worse. Severeal disconnects during the games, even longer times to find a lobby, no patch so far. Sorry, but the time i could actually play the game was so rare that I finally dropped out. Maybe with future updates the game becomes fun to play if it´s not dead by then but it is absolutely not worth the price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With two decent games already in the FF line-up one would think the series would only need a few upgrades to make yet another successful sequel, but that is far the case from this mess. Deep story thrown out the window, countless Vivosaur types seemingly disappearing, and changing the combat from turn based strategy to a select a choice and hope you don't miss, Fossil Fighter Frontier is an utter disgrace to its predecessors. Characters are completely stereotypical and so unoriginal, the plot a complete predictable snore, and any sense of adventure and discovery is lost not far into the game. I would never recommend this game to anyone except six year-olds, which the game seems to be directed towards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To those of you hooping to get this game to recapture bits of nostalgia, beware. This game is a hot mess that you will be ashamed to have spent your money on. In no way does it capture the goofy magic of the past fossil fighters titles, though it capitalizes on the weaknesses. For instance, the opening title of the game is a rinky-dink theme-song that makes your head hurt. The fossil hunting mechanic was devastated by the ridiculous fossil buggy dynamic, and the three-dimensional sprites for all of the dinosaurs in the game appear to have been done hastily and without thought. Honestly, the battles are overtly complicated, and to no avail. When playing this game, I never felt myself thinking that any of the monotonous things that the game did were original or interesting. I have two regrets: that I cannot return this game, and that the fossil fighters franchise has been forever sullied by this pathetic cash grab. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All I can say is that this is one of *the* worst in all of the history of games! Game is full of bugs and glitches that totally trash matches...
if you're planning to play its single player matches then be forewarned! I can easily claim that there isn't and there will never be any unlucky player who has wasted as much time I have on its lousy single player...
The AI is extremely pathetic, and I'm talking about both sides. For example: The only thing the enemy would do is to target the player non-stop like if you're ever caught in their range, and some attacks( Throwing Axe, Hatchet Bomb, Fire Wall, Poison Arrow and Explosive Arrow) are only meant to fall on the player no matter what. The enemy will target someone else but the launched projectile will come flying towards the player! WTH?!!! I've seen it many times and sometimes it just hits the player miraculously out of nowhere! The Mage's Lightning sometimes might have a chance to go through the wall, so be extra careful... And don't get me started on my own team-mates AI! All they'll do is to look confused most of the time and just keep patrolling the area like some maniac whose hit hard on the head with a blunt weapon... They won't actually kill anything unless you're on it and its HPs are already 90% gone, and with some creepy skill they manage to land the death blow which is the remaining  1% of their HP, thus claiming the kill as theirs, in spite of all the effort you've put in to take it down by yourself... Oh, yeah... and if you're attacked yourself by the enemy, what happens now? Your allies jumping in and coming to the rescue? Of course not! Not only do they do nothing and stay idle when your hit, they also tend to move out of the way so that the long ranged morons can finish you off as well! So much for team work, huh? Most of the time you'll feel like your own teammates are the main reason of your loss, nothing else... Fascinating, hey? And one more thing, the number of classes on each side is way too unbalanced, as the other side(your enemy) is loaded with Mages who *always* keep healing and their guards are *always* up, and Warriors who *always* come straight into action to guard their precious teammates... unlike yours who are *always* a bunch of insignificant loons who do nothing but reduce their own side's performance... can it get any better than this?! I barely receive any heals from my own teammates, as it even got to the point of me circling them like crazy and begging them to raise their almost useless staves in the air... there is no teamwork on your side in any way possible, due to the almost non-existent AI that's somehow shoved up their butts and not in their heads... ( Just a side note, stay away from the Legendary difficulty whatsoever, the AI as it mentions does not improve. You just become weaker and the enemy becomes Superman! Well, ummmm, Supermen everywhere! To sum it up, worst single player matches ever to be seen where you'll become the primary target as soon as you step forth on the battlefield, just BS! And the stupendously horrid Hero Team Death Matches, where the only thing the enemy will zoom in on is you! They'll come chasing after you like some mindless undead freaks! Just stay away from such matches as well. I haven't really tried multiplayer and from the little experience I've had, I could say that I dislike it, due to lag... and most importantly the inability to assign any computer teammates to your cause! Now that would make it jeopardy since both sides will not be even at times!
The music score however is awesome and kinda gives you a unique feeling though as if you really are engaging in an LOTRs battle! But again due to the aforementioned flaws and terrible and clunky controls, it ejects you right out of the game and back onto your seat. -.-
The voice-acting is putrid and futile and not to mention overbearing! Frodo will only blabber weird lines like: You can't have it! and what not with his super ear-scratching voice! Or Aragorn, introducing himself 24/7 or that horrible looking Gandalf that just comes out of nowhere and yells: I am Gandalf! Is that so Mr. Douchedalf! I am Got-pissed-off-so-bad-by-your-lame-voice-acting! Pandemic you suck!
Considering many things, the battles are nothing but a mess, you don't know what you're doing most of the times. The campaigns are just plain dull and uninspiring, if it wasn't for the maps and the environments and the soundtrack, you had no idea that you really were in a LOTRs game at all!

Final words: Game would have been awesome if it wasn't for its lazy and cheap game-designing. The reason I gave it a 2 was only because it can still be played if you're planning to die and kill brainlessly without any actual objective... and yes, if you reallly are a fan of the LOTRs franchise, I suggest that you should give it a try just for the laughs! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's kind of fun for about a half an hour then it's old. So sad that I asked for this on my birthday! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to this game because, i've played karaoki games before (playstation "sing, sing, revolution) and i loved it. But, this game fell way short of my expectations. I can hold a tune (especially when the volume is maxed out) and can dance well but, it all goes out the window with this game. The dancing is not on beat instead, you have to follow this stupid bar on the screen so that you can't even see the moves your character is doing. In regards to the singing, I think the pitch markers takes away the fun...i mean, getting the pitch is the point but people don't adjust through sight, rather, they adjust by ear so, it makes the pitch markers irrelevant and confusing. Also, it takes way too long to figure out how to have fun from the get-go which makes this game way out of line of how the wii is immediately entertaining and easy to use right out of the box. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its pretty obviouse what this game has to offer (brief minigame like karaoke a little bit of wiimote "dancing"), if you ABSOLUTLY MUST have this karaoke game...well then buy it, if your looking for something fun thats also A GAME, well...wait another year for another nintendo realese to sit along side Zelda as the only real GAMES that are playable on the console. crapimo unless you realy wanna sing to ur wii. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this game thinking that Rocketeer OMG!! Only to realize yet again...why I have never enjoyed any attempts at flight in video games outside of actual simulators. The 3rd person ground game is ..... eh .... nothing really special. There is a few cool scenes and a few cool ideas but most of it is the same repetetive crap that you saw 10 minutes before but ina different location. The flight mechanic is a distaster. Fly straight up? You do a loop and go flying straight into the ground. It takes WAY too long to turn around and even aim properly. Often I found myself flying into my objective as I could not turn around. Even the camera goes all loopy on you when fly as it is very hard to keep your vision "level" so one second you are flying dead on, the next you are looking at a crooked angle and BAM you hit a wall. The sound track however, is freaking amazing. By far the best part of this game, if I had a chance right now, event hough I know it is being release soon, I would go buy the sound track to this game and get a refund on the game itself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought that I could only die once but Sony has appearantly proved me wrong as they've released a crappy sequel to the crappy first "The Getaway" game. The first game had ridiculous control and bad acting, and they've managed to make this one even worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Out of all the games I've played on the PS2, this is by far the worst. The story is uninteresting, the characters are bland and lack personalities, the voice acting is unimpressive to say the least. The combat system is choppy and the fact that there is no HUD doesn't help.The stealth missions are ridiculous. In the plus column dough, the cars look decent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't waste your time or money. This game comes close to being good, and actually was fun for me for about a week. I hit level 22 in that week, of a max 50. Because of the pre-order headstart and the fact that I didn't get in the game for a few days after retail release, I was behind the curve on leveling, even playing frequently. With other players reaching the top levels it has become obvious that the PvP in this game is not skill based as promised, but based on character level and equipment as in most MMOs. Your weapons are already less effective than what a high level character has access to, this is made worse by higher level characters being able to stack damage resists to further widen the gap. This wouldn't be such an issue if there were level divisions in PvP, but the only divisions are 1-6 and 7-50, so once you reach level 7 you will randomly matched against players of all levels. This is extremely furstrating as you just get killed over and over regardless of how well you play, because you can shoot someone in the back several times and they live to turn around and one-shot you due to the level gap. Levelling up is painful as the PvE is pretty much broken, and only offers two modes. PvP is faster to level up, IF you do well in a match. Unfortunately it's getting harder to do well in PvP as the average player level increases. In a week or two it will be extremely brutal to newbies, and the player numbers are already very low. Can you believe 300 players online at peak times, for a game that's been out just about two weeks? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is going free 2 play.. but it is still pretty crappy. I'm guessing the hacks will set in when it goes F2P as no one will care if they use aimbots at that point. The original money scam was pretty bad.. I think they've figured that part out already though. I would compare this game to Battlefield Heroes, but I think BF:H is a bit better and priced more realistically for the content it offers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not buy this game, it's a complete ripoff. First, it has zero content. Instances that are no better than free mods you'll find for Counter Strike Source, and it's a micro-payment game where you have to pay real world money for buffs that give you an edge in PVP. On top of that, it's a subscription game. It's a complete lose, front, middle and back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A pointless FPS riding the coat tails of earlier successful games, Firestarter isn't pretty, isn't fun, isn't exciting, isn't fluid, isn't necessary. Too bad, I thought a mutant carrying 4 weapons at once could be a fun protagonist. Instead, Firestarter gives us very repetitive action in bland dark rooms and on the clock. Ouch ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am an avid dragonball z fan but this game is nothing more than luck. Your charectors would be at least 5 levels above the enemy but unless the invisible deck gives you good cards, they can just slowly whittle your health to nothing. In short, i have every dbz game available in the usa, but i painfully regret paying 30 dollars for this suped up version of the card game "war". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game does have good graphics and it's fun to play for a few games, but then it just gets boring. No matter what difficulty, the computer is pretty easy to beat. Once you've beaten a few teams in season mode by 20+ points, you'll realize that there's no point in playing an easy game with a crappy shooting style and free-throw style, and has no franchise mode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've pooed out better things to put in my DS in the mornings. But never made the mistake of putting any of them in the machine. This is a poor shooter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

how can this game hve call of duty written on the cover......seriously.......i played a few levels on my friends game and guess what i wanted to do the on the first level quit....first off the game is horrible that the game has no downlpad play.....theres wi fi but not as mny people ever play on that......this basicly explains why i hate the campaign mode......your team sucks is a first......i mean seriously these guys are so bad they have problems even coming close to hitting a target......these guys might as well be used as human shields.....in this one helicopter level your partner randomly sapzzes out and just aims his machine gun at the water and shoots the water for the whole level.......while your prtners doing that your being targeted by a million enemys who have rifals who decide to constantly shoot at you.....another reason i hate this game is because of what happens when you hate your team and want to ditch them.....when you ditch your team and a sign comes up that says your leaving th mission area you light want to go back to your partner.....if you dont and you bump into an enemy then you die in one shot and trust me cpus wont miss at all.....third reason i hate this game is lack of a few important controls.....they dont have a jump button and you can only cross over something if your team tells you to......another bad reason........the poor poor graphics and the fact that the cpus suck miserably......last reason i hate this game is how half of the time your either in the air protecting and shooti ng little dots....or your running from an enemy as a little dot.....there isnt as much of the call of duty shoot out.....overall i dont even recomend renting this game......take away the call of duty nme on the box you get worthless junk you dont want to waste 30 bucks on.......

Good example of "We`ll use U3 Engine without any good idea for game". Gameplay does not exists in this "game" at all. Ugly try-to-jump-and-break-you-keyboard platformer, without any inspiration. Inconvenient controls, try to hold ctrl+w+f at the same time. I`m thinking that game does not worth the money spent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're going to port a console game... make it more challenging and get the controls right... oh yeah, stop limiting the viewpoint perspective.  What they should do is develop the game for the pc and then dumb it down for the console... not the other way around.  Don't buy this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bon bah voilà, encore un "hack and slash" complètement con comme le veut le sous-genre en question de très loin apparenté et parent très pauvre du genre-maître que constitue le jeu de rôle digne de ce nom.

Sacrée daube donc, aux graphismes cependant corrects -malgré des ralentissements assez récurrents- et à l'interface globalement bien pensée. Dire que c'est répétitif, c'est se vautrer dans la tautologie de bas étage et partant, dire que c'est chiant entre deux baillements à s'en décrocher la mâchoire tient de la lapalissade.

A cela s'ajoute la VF ou plutôt les voix en général, car les doubleurs et doubleuses ne font que retranscrire ce qu'il y a à retranscrire... à savoir des voix débiles qui racontent n'importe quoi pendant qu'on "joue", comme une espèce de caricature qui se voudrait spirituelle mais qui fait pschiit, comme si on pétait à un dîner de la Reine d'Angleterre pendant que Benny Hill passe en accéléré.

A oublier d'urgence et à n'utiliser qu'en cas de force majeure à doses homéopatiques (ce filet de bave pendant que tu "joues" putain !). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If it would be an Indie Game for 15$ with an own Franshise , i wouldn´t care much about it. But it pretend to be a Sacred Game. Dont let the Name fool you. Its a buttonsmashing action rpg, with 2, yes you read right, 2 active skills you only can change between missions. No open World, no Item Loot ect. This Game is for absolute Casual Gamers who want smash some buttons for an hour after Work, its no RPG and no Brain is needed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game itself isn't that bad, it's an average action game.

But it's not a Sacred game, remember what they did to dungeon siege 3? It's worse than that.

THere is NO items, No Loot, very limited customization. Feel like a very bad devil may cry game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sacred 3 is a toned down version of an action RPG, similar in style to diablo and so forth, but even less options and customization than diablo 3. There is no loot or proper equipment, and you can only have two abilities on your bars at once. The PC controls are very lacking, hard to play without a controller. Mouse doesn't function properly when using a keyboard. The graphics and voice acting is okay. If it cost like $10, it would maybe be worth it if you planned to play it together with friends. Buying it at full price or to play without friends is just silly, better of getting path of exiles, diablo 3 or something similar 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is only Sacred 3 in name. Content has nothing to do with the Sacred franchise. It's a shame, because a third installment would be the perfect opportunity to polish the game play from the original series while notching up the quality.

After I started playing, I was searching for the inventory button, but you have no inventory! You find no loot! What little skill customization there is, is done between "missions". There is no exploration! You don't ever have the feeling of heading out to see what the world offers or what you can find, because everything is linear. Every time a mission is done, you're yanked from the world back to the character menu!

Not sure how I feel about the voice overs. They're kinda lame, though delivered with a certain energy.

Diablo 3 does not look so bad now. That's saying a lot.

I give it two stars for pissing all over the Sacred franchise and abusing fan goodwill. Next time, developers, use another name and avoid the karma of deflated expectations. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

very bad game, not at all recommended, difficult with the keyboard control, you can not pick up objects from the floor, very bad game in all its aspects (please for removing deep silver games as well, thanks). I wish they could return the money, greetings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, I see alot of people complaining why people don't like it.  That it isn't Sacred 1 or 2 and it's good that it changed so drastically.  Let me ask you, would you feel the same if they too the Fallout franchise and did the same thing?  I think not.  What about Elder Scrolls?  Sacred has, or more precise had, a basic formula that many people enjoyed and like Elder Scrolls and Fallout, expected.  Here are the two biggest issues for me about this game:
1)  It should never have been called Sacred 3 and it is no secret why they did it.  If it was named something more along the lines of 'Sacred Citadel', that would have been more acceptable.
2)  The voice script is HORRIBLE.  Maybe if I was 10 I would enjoy it, ....maybe.  This alone makes this game just about unplayable.

I also saw that some of you say that we should have watched the gameplay trailer before we bought it.  Well, the I did, and the gameplay trailer really didn't show the specifics at all.  It could easily be looked at as still an open world game.

This game should not have the Sacred name, it should have been a download and should not have been 40 to 50 bucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Huge disappointment. Could be better. Could be worse. 0/10 is way too low. It's waste of money. It's waste of time if you play 32 hours per day. Don't buy it. Ride to Hell is still little bit worse. The settings are.... Game testers are.... No comment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is NOT a "Sacred" game. This is NOT Sacred 3, even though it's called that.

What it is, is a bland imitation of Diablo, or Torchlight, or Van Helsing, or Titan Quest.

It is not open world, it's totally linear - just fighting through corridors the whole way. Calling this Sacred borders on fraud. It's ok, but you've seen it all before; endless brain dead fighting against never ending hordes of enemies. Some of it is downright stupid, as if designed by an idiot: For example, some enemies have "shields"; they are invulnerable unless you break their shield.  To fight them, you press a key - and their shields instantly break (Literally; It happens with one keypress) and then you can kill them. Why the hell would anyone carry a shield into battle then? What kind of idiot would think this makes a fun, interesting or challenging fighting system? Note to Deep Silver: Fire whoever designed the fighting system. Keep whoever did the graphics. Fire whoever pushed for the closed world system - instead of an interesting game where I choose what to do, we got a piece of ****  that tells me where to go and what to do.

In it's own right, as an action VERY lite RPG clone, it's a niceish-looking meh-playing 5 or 6 out of 10.

But as "Sacred 3" this is a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible.  The controls are terrible and the art is like the a horrible version of the B.C. comic animated.  It will frustrate you like only broken levels and controls can.  The concept could be fun but it was executed by programmers that must hate you.  Stay away! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How come theres only 4 weapons? i remember playin a mac version which had lots of weapons like rocket launchers, flame throwers. they should have ported that version instead of this crappy one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So let me get this straight...only three environments to race in...and an unlock system to force me to play through? You forced too hard, now I dont want to play anymore! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Perhaps the single worst example of cutscence and gameplay segregation in history. Vincent in cutscenes can jump six stories and take down an attack helicopter without needing to reload. Vincent in game plinks away at footsoldiers and needs keycards to bypass a tall fence. Playing through it, you'll encounter more boring cliches than you can shake a stick at: waves and waves of enemies, shamelessly-recycled boss fights, exploding barrels, moronic AI, forced turret sections, forced stealth sections, the works. It's slow, boring, and not worth your time.
How about that story, then? Well, it's hardly better. It's heavily connected to the plot of Final Fantasy VII, but at the same time, it has very little to do with it. Hojo's alive now, there's a whole bunch of stuff about Deepground and the Tsvets that was never even implied in the original, and while most of the cast shows up at some point, they're generally just there for fanservice. The ones who get focus, primarily, are Vincent, Yuffie, Cait Sith, and Cid. Cid is generally okay, but Yuffie and Cait Sith were terrible in the first game, and have only gotten more annoying with time. Vincent himself... well, you know how people claim to hate Cloud because 'all he does is mope,' but it's not true because the guy actually did go through some pretty meaty development in the original game? Vincent really does do nothing but mope. He has no goals, no agency, no likes or dislikes, most of his dialogue is ellipses. At times, he has flickers of a romance, but he approaches it with the same monotone dullardry that he approaches everything else. He's basically a brick that shoots things. You could replace him with a gun turret on wheels and keep most of the plot intact. Well, you'd lose the bits where he turns into hilarious-looking monsters, but that's not a bug, it's a feature.
About the nicest thing I can say about this game is that the FMV cutscenes look very good, and the soundtrack is quite nice. Watch them on YouTube if that piques your interest. If you must own every single appearance by the FFVII characters and have Vincent Valentine tattooed on your chest, then I'd say you might be able to enjoy yourself. Otherwise... no. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Since this was a movie game I naturally set my standards low...Yet this game still fails to reach these low standards.A terrible third person shooter, the transformers move slower than a geriatric snail in robot form, each robot only having 1 worthwhile weapon, usually a shotgun or blast weapon.The vehicle mode is ruined by having no truly open areas to move around and fight in. The programmers have tried to compensated for this by allowing the vehicle to â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is awful.The graphics are ok,but the controls are painful,terrible and the vehicle mode is horrible.The history is disappointing,the sounds are decent but at the end is awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All of the boards are extremely short. All the minigames are free-for-all style. The game doesn't have an online mode. All the major features you'd want in a Mario Party game on the 3DS are not in this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible!!!!This game doesn´t have any depth or quality that saves this horrible, crappy game.First of all, they introduced the lame Bowser Tower.There even a Stupid event that you lose all of your M Points! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. How far the mighty have fallen. This series used to be a favorite of mine for it's balancing and character design. This entry is just anemic. It's missing a lot of the favorites from the series, the arcade mode is short and way too easy, and the netcode makes the user deal with enough lag to be consistently frustrating. The fighting system is ok but most characters have actually lost moves since the last game. With games like BlazBlue and SFIV out right now, there is no way I can justify the money I spent on this title. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good fun but very similar to the previous Army of two. The graphic doesn't look like it's from the Frostbite 2. The graphic is not bad but far from what would be expected especially since it's from the frostbite 2 engine. Gameplay is fun but gets repetitive too quickly. It's best to play the campaign in coop mode and shoot things up with your friends. The story is too predictable and gets really boring. Army of two could really do with a reich story and the experience would be very different. The customisation n the game though is great. There many many choices you can customise on your weapons and the customisation is a good experience. Overall the performance of this game is disappointing and not what i have expected. I expected a lot more of AoT devil's cartel but it is a let down. The recommendation is to buy the game when it gets cheap or on sale. Rental is also a good option. This games is NOT worth it's retail price and I highly recommend NOT to buy it until it get cheaper. If you want a solid and fun third person shooter experience there are a lot of choices both older games and new games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not even worth the ten dollars it ends up costing. The cames are about as uninspired as anything I have ever seen. Playing this game is not even fun when it's played out of sheer desperation of nothing else to do... I would rather sit doing nothing than play this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got it for the xbox 360 and the games pretty lame. I was excited too bc I couldn't find the game anywhere and when I finally did, I was disappointed. it's just like super smash brothers except it doesn't have any qualities that made SSB such a hit. the fights are pretty boring, the story mode voices are redundant and lame, it basically doesn't keep my attention. I had some hope for the game but that's now all out the window. if you really want to try this game, I recommend renting it at best 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hey man, just quietly this game was shocking. Even from the beginning when you have to die as part of the storyline, I thought I was really dead so kept turning my xbox off. It took me ages to realise that you were supposed to die. Also I found the constant storyline interruptions very irritating, it slows down how fast you can finish the game. All in all it is not a very good game hey. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I expected the game to be fun for a few play throughs before I became fed up with it. At no point while playing did it seem fun. Probably the most boring game that I have played in a while. In addition I expected my children to enjoy this game, they were fed up within 20 minutes. Terrible game. not recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just as Zelda deserves that any player has the opportunity to try out the new console and not lose that title, this game is one of many that I hope that every time they come out less regularly and that Nintendo redirects its products to the real player, Is aware of the current situation and the one that really values the quality.

People who were looking for this type of games already bought the Wii and the couple of games to make the dribble and it is the console that defrost when you do some stay in your house and remember the console. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just gave it this score to even out those wackos who gave it a ten. This game really deserves a decent five, or thereabouts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

PS1 style Graphics and generic gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a successor to Ninja Gaiden 1 & 2 this is a tragedy. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. Note: I started playing the story after the claw and scythe were made available, but while they definitely do add to the game it's simply not enough. This is not a Ninja Gaiden sequel. This is Call of Duty: Ninja Gaiden. The game plays like this. Walk forward, respond to quicktime event (QTE), walk forward, mash the X button to defeat wave of enemies, climb wall, mash X some more, jump down, mash X even more,defeat boss, watch uninteresting cutscene, repeat ad nauseum.At no point did I feel like I was truly in control of Ryu. The combat has been extremely dumbed down. It's almost impossible to pull away from a group and target a single enemy since the game pretty much decides that for you. Seriously, all you have to do is hammer X repeatedly for 8 hours with a few slides thrown in here and there- there's absolutely no challenge. On the higher difficulties I found myself dying constantly, but only because of my inability to triage thanks to the games autotarget taking nearly all of the control out of my hands. I have no idea how many times I would go out of my way to rush the guy with the rocket launcher only to have Ryu spin on his heels and the attack the dude chasing directly behind me as soon as I made an attack input simply because the game decreed it so.The skilled and tactical approach to each encounter from the previous games has been entirely erased. Slam on the X button, if you get surrounded slide out of the huddle, then slam X even more. When your arm glows red hit Y. You just beat the game. There's no need to jump off of walls for more powerful strikes, no need to memorize combos, no need to know what weapons work best in what scenarios - just beat the living hell out of the X button.There are WAY too many QTEs and they seriously break the game's flow, and even a few hours in the game constantly reminds you to press LT to block/X for light attack/Y for heavy. If you turn these off in the menus it also turns off the QTE prompts leading to you having to guess whenever one pops up (every 2-3min). Kunai climbing is annoying, rope climbing is entirely pointless, I could go for days.On top of all of this the framerate is horrible, the camera is way too close making it worse than it ever was, some parts of the game are extremely underlit and it took forever to get the brightness settings correct, the game is so easy the only way you'll really die is from enemies with cheap and unblockable throw attacks, there isn't much variety to the enemies, etc etc.It's obvious this game was simplified and streamlined to attract the casual crowd which was a failed attempt unless you're looking for a completely mindless action game, and a ton of emphasis was placed on actually telling a story. Unfortunately that doesn't bode well either as this one, like the previous two, is nonsensical and forgettable.This game sucks and doesn't deserve to bear the Ninja Gaiden name. What little fun to be had here is marred by extremely shallow combat, technical shortcomings, an asinine attempt at a story, and complete lack of legitimate challenge. The first 2 NGs were deep, challenging games that I initially sucked at only because I wasn't good enough... yet. As the games went on they seemed to get easier, but the truth was that I was just getting better. NG3 lays down and spreads its legs for you as soon as you put the disk in the tray without making you earn it. Just keep pressing X. I want my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Huge disappointment. The people that created that game should be ashamed and leave the industry for good, because they obviously have no talent.

The story is pretty good but holy **** the gameplay is unbearable. Seriously gameplay wise this it's not just bad, it's so bad that you have to ask yourself if it was intended that way, perhaps some inside joke or competition between devs, who can make the crappiest stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a terrible game is not worth such a great licence.
The graphics are completly outdated, the combat is terrible, the story is the thing that keeps this game out of a negative review, so 0/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was unimpressed.

It's a tower defense game where you play in a very beautiful environment but with substandard interface and upgrade options.  In fact, you can't upgrade your towers at all during the first five levels and clicking the "speed up" icon will kill you more often than if you suffer through the long marches.

In terms of pros, the game is visually very nice.  The "creeps" you are killing can be very funny.  Some of them look like brooms and some of them have eyeballs that dangle in front of their bodies.

In terms of cons, the very first "bomb" they gave me does less damage than a single hit from a single tower and costs more than all the other starter towers.  That should tell you how poorly conceived this game is.  The card forging system is interesting, but ultimately fell flat for me.  The tutorial is endless, condescending, and in some cases counter-productive.

This game is a rewrap of several other free-to-play casual games I've seen from the same genre but with the Prime World theme and characters.  If you love Prime World, stick with Prime World; don't get fooled by the marketing.  For me, this one was a pass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing to see here, move along. Boring, repetitive, derivative game-play, uninspired graphics and, most importantly for a free-to-play game, little value for your hard earned dollars. The fatal flaws are all well covered in other reviews. It is doubtful this developer will survive long enough to build out a devoted community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shameful, utterly uninspired, generic isometric brawler with Marvel character skins. This is an absolutely terrible game that is blatantly exploiting the Marvel licence to severely gouge its fans. We live in time where gaming has reached a level where this type of shovelware should no longer be able to exist. It takes truly unimaginative people to turn the incredible Marvel universe into this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Below average game with lots of annoyances unless you spend big   A weak clone of Diablo and Torchlight with a free to play business model that will make you broke.

The vast majority of this game is locked.  In order to get more than one starter character you have to spend as much as $20 on a single character.  Costumes?  Those are even more.  I'm not joking, if you want to look like the 1990s cartoon version of Cyclops, that is $15, and they go as high as $20.

To unlock all the playable characters (more are coming, like  DLC) you would spend well over $100.  To get the costumes, it's hundreds easily.

But that's not where the nickel and diming stop.

Inventory is pathetically small, and costs  to expand.
Cosmic Keys necessary for dailies are over $1
Respecs cost money
Unstable Molecules for crafting require money.
And there is even gambling (fortune cards) for $$$

Combine that with the fact that the game isn't very good, and it's pass.

The story is pathetically terrible.  You actually get beaten by a lawyer at one point.

And as far as a diablo clone goes.  This one is below average at best.  Mediocre boss fights that are mostly just wild spam events because of the number of players, and jumpy game play from the constant internet connection. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If this game had launched with anything but marvel in its title. everything about it would have been trashed.  That being said, the only redeeming features of the game are its playable characters (almost all of which are buried beneath an insane cash shop) and the stylized comic cutscenes.

Outside of that, you have a poor mans diablo which costs nearly 300% more to unlock the basic features of the same game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I REALLY wanted this game to be good because I grew up watching the X-men cartoons and I'm a big fan of ARPGs and MMOs. Unfortunately, after a couple hours, I was extremely disappointed.

Here is how Marvel Heroes works: I run into a room, right click every enemy once (because they all die in 1 hit no matter what they are), pick up my loot, and move on. I know that ARPG games are generally easy at the beginning, but I could play this with my eyes closed. After leveling for a few hours, it didn't get any harder. Bosses are the same except they take more than 1 hit to kill and I might have to use a health kit. No strategy needed, just face tank and right click.

Aside from that, there are tons of little things that just bother me about this game. Gear does not affect your appearance in ANY way and there are hundreds of characters running around that look EXACTLY like me. Throwing wooden crates at an enemy seems to do more damage than shooting them with lightning (wtf?). Many enemies drop "experience orbs" and I just do not understand the purpose of giving players exp in orb form. The Thing's charge ability appears to be broken and he ends up on the other side of enemies instead of charging into them (would make more sense if you saw a video)

Maybe this is one of those games that only gets good towards the end when your character(s) is developed a little more. Sadly, there is not much incentive to play that far for me.

I truly feel sorry for any die-hard Marvel fan that dropped $200 into this game for a founder's pack. It just isn't good.

2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is a direct clone of the original Diablo series...but lacks any amount of depth in most areas.  Though they have done a great job of capturing the look of the Marvel Heroes..thats pretty much all this game has done.  the core game has enough content that you will complete it within your first 20-22 levels... then it becomes a tedious grind as you work your way to 60 using not the open world you level in...but standing around running your short repeats of boss fights at mission terminals.

Skill trees are shallow, and odds are every person playing the same hero, will have the exact same setup.  This is because Gazillion decided to lock re-specing your hero in their cash shop...making the idea of experimenting with builds (one of the main hooks in the Diablo series) an expensive one at $5 bucks a pop.  The "retcon" as it it is called does have a very very small chance at dropping in game, but checking in the forums, many, many people have played up to level 30+ already, and never gotten one...not that a single one would be much good anyhow.  And since you can only have one of each hero...and their is no re rolling..you are stuck with any skills you chose, or you must pay them.
And speaking of the cash shop...

People like to say "But it's free..."  Well, yes..but no it isn't.  Of the 20 available characters, you get to choose ONE of 5 starters (Daredevil, Scarlet Witch, Storm, thing and Hawkeye).  You also have 2 chances between the start and story finish where you MIGHT get another of the starters (I say might, because they have made it random..so you could end up with copies of the one you already have... thats right.. you can recieve duplicate character tokens...but you can only have one of any hero..so the duplicates must be used post level 30 to upgrade your Ultimate Power.... Lame.

Characters average about between $6  $20 each.  Costumes from $10- $15.  Mind you, this is to repeat the same content, and costumes add nothing but an appearance change...yet they charge as though you are getting a new game each time.  Tie inthe fact that these are also supposed to have a chance to drop in game...but it's purely random.  so if you have plans to play a specific hero, you're encouraged to buy it in the store, as your chance of getting THE ONE YOU WANT are slim to none.  Again, drop rates are tweaked t be under 1% chance..from ANY mob (no place you can farm for a specific drop..it's all random, and from anything).  And of course it's because they are pushing their overpriced cash shop.  How overpriced you say...well, at last count, the Ultimate pack, which was pre sold for 200.00 (already ridiculous) wouold cost you close to $1,500.00 after launch, if you tried to buy what all was included (and that wasn't including the missing 5-6 characters that didnt make launch.

Early access was a mess, with many many people still not able to logon to the game as late as yesterday.  Bugs abound from sounds to graphics.  Characters have zero balance, abilities not scaling, or working, what they call PvP....uuugh.  Lets also not leave out, that once you clear the story mode, that their is no additional content to keep you leveling to 60..other than the mission terminals I mentioned.  Which is simply bosses with their powers boosted in a cheesy way...oh..and characters made WEAKER as y ou add people to your group.  Made weaker so that the boss is "more challenging"... but it's more like broken.  And also, another item, cosmic keys, you must pay for (or hope the RNG gods are good to you)  to enter special content.  Content behind a pay-wall...again.

So if you are into Marvel comics, then this game will cater you you visually...but if you are looking for innovative, fun gameplay, and fair pricing  this is not the game you're looking for.  If you are looking for an MMO (as they want to call this thing..lol), then this is definitely not for you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The beta and official launch of the game was a shining example of Gazillion's lack of experience in the industry. If you're not interested in seeing anything ground breaking and are merely looking for something to play to pass the time then it's worth it, but if you're expecting a high quality AAA product then you're better off looking elsewhere. The following are a few key points:

- Story campaign is very short (8-12 hours max to complete)

- End game is extremely repetitive (same missions over and over with slow experience gain)

- Heroes don't differ much. The mechanics are very close from hero to hero they just change the graphic/name of skill.

- As expected Hero balancing is off the charts bad. Many useless skills resulting in very one dimensional builds. PvP balance is non existent. The developers work on the game much like an amateurish mod team with each developer making changes individually without any extensive thought process or collaboration with the other hero developers.

Essentially you'd play this game because you enjoy the idea of playing of one of your favorite comic book/movie heroes; however, what you have pictured in your head and what will transpire in game in terms of your heroes power are drastically different. Iconic heroes are beat up by common thugs late game. Range heroes are king while melee heroes litter the field with their corpse.  However, the game is free so what do you have to lose? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is one big letdown.  It was founded by good people, who do excellent work interacting with the community.  That said, the game simply is not fun at all.  It is an item hunt game with the worst items and item drop rate of any arpg I've every played.  If it didnt have the Marvel title and license, it would already be gone.

On top of that, patches come out fast and furious, but without being tested...leading to stupid amounts of bugs, numerous small patches meant as fixes that really dont ever fix anything, and tons of download time.  Half or more of the characters are completely broken and unplayable at any given time....soon as they fix 1 hero, they break 2 more.    If you dont mind lots of bugs, boring gameplay, broken characters, and the worst loot system ever....then by all means play this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game offers you a wide variety of Marvel Heroes, mostly enough to please any fan, but you can only pick one as a starter, and you have to get the others though in-game currency wich is slow, really slow, or through money. In the beggining, heroes could drop from any mob, and that was ok (that was the main way besides paying to get a new hero), now, the drops were long ago removed and you're stucked with this system, that I don't really like, (at least on its own, I'd like it with old hero token drops). So now it feels boring and uninteresting,

The graphics are ok, though messy sometimes when everybody is spamming hard every power they have.

Heroes will always have the same aspect no matter what do you equip on them, besides from a few cosmetic upgrades and different costumes, wich doesn't really makes much sense, since costumes have a lot of buffs you want to keep. Well, you can always use the money-sink crafter for swapping those buffs and what-not, but whatever.

Leveling up is a real pain, next step above slow, and since content gets repetitive too soon, it feels boring and boring as you keep playing.

Drops rates are bad and strange, from patch to patch, you'll notice that determinate item drop more, or don't drop at all. Gearing your character the way you want is hard and time consuming, should it be different? well, I don't know, but I've seen many people claiming differences between Diablo 3 and MH, but this makes them pretty much the same. If you want to gear your Hero with decent items, you'll be stuck spending a ton of time farming/trading in both games.

All in all, the feeling of the game is that it gets really boring, really fast.

At first when I say the trailer for this game, I thought it would be fun. Being a comic book fan my entire life, I've enjoyed games that have the heroes I grew up with. But in all honesty, this game was a big disappointment for me. The fact that there are large amounts of the same character you play in the same area is semi-hard to over look, put the game play leaves much to be desired. I do find the dialogue to be very well written, but sadly that's the only thing good I can say about this game. The fact that you either have to push through the terrible game play to get a new hero, or pay to get one, adds a sense of "pay-to-win" in this game. The characters you start out with are, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Daredevil, the Thing, and Storm. This minimal choice leads to what I had brought up before, the fact that you end up in the same area with around another twenty versions of you. Which as you can imagine causes some confusion in the midst of battle. The overall game play was mediocre, and left you with a sense of depression. If you want a hero mmo, I suggest looking somewhere else, because this game wont even quench your thirst for as long as it takes to install.

While Marvel Heroes had the potential to be something great, sadly it is nothing more than a cash cow for Gazillion Entertainment. Essentially a very weak clone of Diablo 2 dressed up in Marvel Cosplay.

The game has very little content and pads it out by expecting the player to repeat the content for extra rewards and then buy a new character to repeat the process. Additional zones suffer the same repetitiveness and quickly become dull.  There are some positives to the game. The art design is quite good, and the game itself does flow well, when it doesn't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again. VA work is top notch and the writing of the story mode is well crafted. Unfortunately a lot of this must be juxtaposed against the fact that new content is rarely released and when it is released it is usually a level that is recycled in some way.

This is a free to play game, although it should really be called free to pay. The game uses a carrot-on-a-stick approach, promising special content related items, such as costumes, pets and special in game items that drop with less frequency than a solar eclipse occurs. Many of these items, don't actually drop in game at all, despite Gazillion's claims to the contrary. 90% of the content that emerges from this game involves the Cash Shop in some way. Characters are often worked and re-worked, but only one is given for free. While it is possible to get new characters for free, it is a slow process made slower by using forcing players to use that currency to buy crafting tools, which can drop in the game but rarely do. F2P currency cannot be used to by costumes or pets either. Costumes can be obtained by crafting but it involves re-leveling characters and spending costumes and the aforementioned crafting tools. Producing a random result. In addition to this, Gazillion ties exclusive content to what essentially amounts to "scratch and win" cards, which must be purchased with real money and more often than not, will produce a low end cash shop item which supposedly increases drop rates but never seems to have a noticeable effect.

While many of us are used to these kind of sins being committed by f2p developers, Gazillion takes it to the next level by selling permanent NPC followers that make the game easier. These too can be purchased with f2p currency, but with the same currency that one buys playable characters with. Again, slowing down progress in obtaining content unless money is spent. Unlike playable heroes, these Team-Up characters are never given out for free, but must be purchased, gambled with Fortune Cards or grinded at the expense of PC heroes.

Another sad thing is that this game, being an MMO-type, lacks many of the basic functions one would come to expect from a game like this. There is no secure trading. Items are traded by dropping them on the ground and can't be verified until the trade is complete, and Gazillion of course takes an "At your own risk" policy with this. There is no quest sharing at all, making partying difficult and often not worth one's time. Players can create "Supergroups" which are essentially guilds, but guilds serve no real purpose and there is no benefit to making one beyond the cosmetic features and getting a private channel which is not all that private.

The game also has a huge issue with bugs and glitches being passed down with every patch which are not addressed with any urgency, if at all. Gazillion never patches bug fixes alone and always insist that fixes, often game breaking fixes, will be addressed in the next patch. As of this writing, The Fisk Tower levels can be created with no mobs at all, something that was supposed to be fixed months ago but is still awaiting said fix.

The sad reason that Gazillion gets away with this behavior, aside from slapping  the "Marvel" name on to this garbage, is that there is a frothing group of players who are too eager to frivolously and incomprehensibly hand over their money. Those players often demand little from the game and are pleased as punch to spend hours upon hours doing nothing but running the same levels repeatedly for the sake of prestige.

Making matters worse is that Gazillion not only fosters and coddles these players, but also actively silences criticisms of the game and their business model. The Agents who police the community will harass and punish anyone who points out problems with the game and have been known to ban accounts for players who speak their mind on these issues.

In summary, the game is ultimately free to play and there are some good things about it, but they are far outweighed by the problems and by a greedy developer who's community relations can only be described as utterly disingenuous. I cannot at all recommend this game. It is repetitive, quickly becomes dull and everything is designed to trap you into buying stuff from the cash shop and would have failed if not for the "Marvel" name.

Try it if you must, but don't spend any money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's free so give it a try yourself, but i just coudn't get into it. I like ARPGs. The graphics look a bit dated, not as nice as Diablo or POE. I don't like that your gear doesn't change your characters look at all.

Also it's annoying that the gear is so specific to each hero each item only works for a certain hero so if you don't have them unlocked your inventory fills with stuff for others. Just wasn't fun overall... didn't entertain me for very long

Also most of the 10s on metacritic user reviews seem to be faked accounts, and barley in english... whats up with that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Marvel Heroes is billed as an MMOARPG, but is actually just an ARPG without lobbies. Developers at Gazilion have recently backpedaled and claimed that Marvel heroes is an ARPG and not an MMO.

Conveniently for Gazilion, this announcement comes after the game has launched and they have collected peoples money. On top of that Gazilion has a no refund policy.

As for the game itself, Marvel Heroes is a very basic and short ARPG. lacking the features of Diablio 3 and other modern ARPGs. The story mode can be finished at around level 23 and this can accomplished in a weekend of light playing.

The game is free to play, but unlike most F2P games, the entire game is designed to force you into the VERY expensive cash shop. While most F2P games offer cosmetic options, the cash shop in marvel heroes is a necessity. You will start with a selection of bland uninteresting "C roster" heroes and very little storage.

To sum up, Marvel Heroes is an ARPG with very little content and a Pay to Enjoy pricing structure. Expect to pay 12-20 bucks per Hero, and 12-20 dollars per costume. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a total let down.  I bought the supposed Premium pack with all the unlocked characters but got nothing.  Response from support was the site is still in development.  Would like my  back at this point in time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Summary: If you like Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, go play it again; its been years, you'll probably have fun. This game is a very pale shadow of that one and brings nothing new to the table.

This game is a buggy Diablo clone and proud of it. Game creation seems to have followed these steps:
Step 1: Make a Diablo-clone engine; skimp on QA; nobody will care if the game just doesn't run or you have serious problems, its free-to-play.
Step 2: Populate it with the story and some of the characters from the 7-year-old Ultimate Alliance game.
Step 3: Release.

Where are the issues?
In step 1, they made a decent-looking engine and packaged it with a terrible installer; patching the game has on multiple occasions caused it to stop working, completely aside from the occasional server outages, leading to a frustrating uninstall/redownload/reinstall cycle that Steam users can avoid some but not all of. This points to a lack of a decent QA department; or more likely a lack of paying attention to said department; and/or mediocre programming.

Step 2 is the more frustrating part, however. This game's plot reads very much like the plot of ultimate alliance. In fact: "Doctor Doom has a scheme involving gathering villainous allies and artifacts so that he can have divine levels of power and reshape the world in his own image; a variety of Marvel-universe heroes combine to stop him." is the plot for both games. While Ultimate Alliance took you underwater, to the far reaches of space, to demon hellscapes, cities, and all sorts, Marvel Heroes takes you to.. mostly boring earth cities and wilderness, along with places you already saw in Ultimate Alliance.

If you think I'm making alot of comparisons between the games, there's a good reason;
Ultimate Alliance let you play as the whole roster for one price, was an action-oriented game you could play offline, local co-op, or online with friends, featured plenty of power customization, various costumes, and even some item collection, had jumping, picking and tossing items, and so forth.
Marvel Heroes is... a 2D version of ultimate alliance with no initial cost and a much higher eventual one if you want to unlock many heroes. The gameplay is incredibly similar with the only truly noticable difference being the tedious effort of collecting and managing identical-looking pieces of gear; items that don't even impact character appearance but just background stats.

Do not play this game. Do not give these people your time or your money. For the price of the Iron Man and Spiderman unlocks for this game, you can have Ultimate Alliance in one of its many versions shipped to you, and play the same story, on much more interesting locations, with a more diverse cast of characters, still play it with your friends as a team, and not worry about the incompetent programmers at Gazillion.

A repetetive and broken third person shooter in which you run around as a giant robot killing other giant robots. Or just the one giant robot whos a bit harder. Or escort some people while fending off some more giant robots. Or fly/drive around smashing into glowing objective markers. That basically sums up the whole campaign, which revolves around the aforementioned missions. The good bits from the first game, like the freeroam and destruction, are gone, replaced with boring level design coupled with almost no destruction. Shooting is twitchy, due to the fact that you have to hold down the 'pull out gun' control then fire, and melee isn't all that fun. Transforming is great and all and the driving has greatly improved from the last game, there is no longer the nitro and drift and jump mechanics that made it feel like a driving game (a poorly designed one, however). Now, transforming is simply sprinting, which is a good thing as theres not so many details that the design team didn't have enough time to make it.
Multiplayer is sub-par, with a decent mathcmaker but only 4v4 matches. There is no progression and some characters are too powerful, though all feel the same in terms of handling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just as the movie is, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" is a terrible, terrible game. First it was loosely installed within my computer, possibly because of the lack of updates and patches those **** forgot to make. Not only that; the multiplayer servers are empty and disorganized, the campaign is too repetitive and monotonous etc. This is a game you would definitely love to miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not at all what I expected. Became boring after about 20 min. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All I can say is get Syphon Filter not this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I expected it to be a lot more fun than it is. It is so boring because there is little customization like other Sims games. The controls and gameplay are really slow which makes it unbearable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I not motivated enough to even give a proper review of this terrible game. I uninstalled after about an hour. It is the worst FPS I've played in a long time. It is so outdated in every way that it is annoying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is really not that good of a game. If you're going to play this series, stick with an older version like Conflict: Global Terror, which to me seems to have better graphics(sadly) and has 4 player co-op, instead of 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gave this game a 2 because I actually got to play Co-op with my brother in MN for a while. That was fun, then, it stopped working on Co-op, nobody in Steam answers forums, and neither does Eidos. Lack of support= *&^%$#@! game. BTW Sins of a Solar Empire will cure that!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game it seems it was made for small children, very poor graphics it looks like a nintendo wii game as the critics say. If you activate a second controller a message would come up saying no co-op available at this time and does not go away unless you turn off the other controller, it has many other stupid little problems that are really annoying and I only played it for 30 min. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be one of the worst Dragonball Z games i have ever played, and i have played most of them since i was so willing to buy this despite the Â£38 price tag (Buyers remorse)Positives first, the graphics are nice, good scenery, good models, good effects on the ki charging and the power ups and the energy attacks, but that is it.The negatives, well lets just say everything else is a negative.There is no freedom in the fighting, you are almost forced to continuously use combo attacks which initiate themselves after the shorts amount of punching (3) this is the only was to gather enough energy to fire up a Kamehameha wave, which is sad because the amount of damage the punches do means the fight is almost over after 2 Kamehameha waves.the camera is shoddy and the story is horrendously boring, don't get me wrong i love DBZ and the story, but something is missing here.the world travelling system is boring too, and pointless. The fights are always the same no matter who you are and you are always forced to do the same horrible combo's (watching goku chase after a number of different enemies he has just punched becomes boring even before the end of the saiyan saga.All in all, a boring game unfortunatly, DBZ raging blast series was better, and burst limit was better than that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is **** This game is just Rock,Paper,Scissor Simulator 2011. They left out so many characters like why can i play as ssj gohan but not as regular gohan?. They also left out many things in the story mode like the fight against super 17. There is also this hero mode which is just **** You don't have many choices to customize your Character. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All you people think this game is worthy of more? The only reason it got a 2 is because of the storyline....the controls, camera anges, stupid AI...sheesh. Thank God I rented it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ribbit King initially caught my eye as it looked like a unique spin on the golf genre. It soon became clear however that winning relied almost completely on luck making multi-player games a complete bore as two identical shots result in totally different results. If you want a fun golf game pick up Everybody's Golf instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played the original Castlevania on the NES, and I grew up playing these types of platform games. If you are a fan of the theme of the original games. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! You will be disappointed.

The storyline is broken because of some sort of crazy notion to depict the story from the vampires view while providing generic game play and sub par graphics. If you are a Castlevania fan, you will want to piss on this game and set it on fire. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Heres what I found to be the best and worst of the game, in order of presedence.

Positives

Good story line
Very good visuals, particularly the scenery (it seemed this is where they put their most effort into.)
Fluid, responsive, satisfying combat. Completely reminiscent to the God Of War series.
Good characters/voice acting. I personally enjoyed watching all of the cut scenes.
Partially destructible environment. Cans clutter and such.
Challenging boss fights.

Negatives

It wants you to play with a game pad. The game does not seem to be designed for a mouse and keyboard. Every Single Time there is a quick time event the UI will come up telling you to spam things like the left trigger to an Xbox controller. Made me have to consult the key mapping way way too often.

Claims to be partly open world when it really is not. You get to revisit previously traveled to destinations. Imagine one massive hallway the entire game through. (a rail system) they call it open because you can run all the way back to the beginning if you really want to.

Dracula does not act like Dracula. You find yourself with menial tasks, and small obstacles that make little sense. You're supposed to be the Prince of Darkness.. Satan is concerned with how powerful you are.. but hold on I have to run down stairs to turn on a power switch to activate an elevator to go to the next floor. Tell me that's something a Vampire Lord would do.

Silly stealth sections. Again, knowing for-well that Satan fears you, you decide to morph into a rat and sneak around a guard or two, here and there. WTF

Invisible walls. If a spot is not game essential, you're not going there. Don't expect an Assassins Creed style of play here.

The game holds your hand the whole way through. The camera will usually show you exactly where you need to go, how to get there, and have either a glowy thing waiting for you, or a character shouting to you with explanations. Yet, some parts you just haven't the foggiest bit of a hint of where to go.

I had 16 hours of game play with one run through. Medium difficulty, average pace.

Low replay value. There are elements present to keep you busy after the main story is over, however I can't see entertainment value lasting with that; or starting a new save; albeit there are always different difficulty levels if you're into that.

The only way to die in this game is in a giant explosion of blood. The enemies almost always blow up, or burst into blood. I think that greatly takes away from the feel of it.

Also, if you want the exact same outfit but in black, you can spend $1.00 on steam. hooray

In conclusion, I would only recommend this as a rental at best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Throughout the bland sections of modern-world gameplay littered with forced stealth sections that are as fun as a root canal, the repetitive combat that becomes boring before the tutorial is even over, the linear climbing sections, and the vast, open, and notably empty castle world with a pretty environment and nothing else at all of interest, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2 was nothing but a big chore to play from the start to the moment I couldn't stand anymore and turned it off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't fall for the fanboy hyped ratings, the professional critics are spot on. C:LOS 2 is a colossal disappointment.. From the unnecessary stealth missions, to the unimpressive enemies, the poor pacing to the underwhelming gameplay,  this game is simply not as powerful as the first C:LOS. The game simply has disappointed me to the point where I simply want to dumb it down to the easiest difficulty and plow through it. It's a shame because the first one was the most favorite game I played last year (waited for the PC version). I really wanted another magical journey like the first C:LOS, but instead you are tossed around  disconnected environments and thrown into ridiculous stealth missions that break you from the few enjoyable moments in the game. I was really looking forward to this title, sadly, it has not only missed my expectations, but is beginning to feel like a chore to finish. Time to pass the torch to another developer, this series needs a wrap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A truly awful Console port to the PC. It makes no attempt to support standard PC controls and even the tutorial names gamepad buttons. Leaving new players on the PC guessing which key that should be. Everything PC users hate about console ports can be found in this game. It is interesting story, but the piss port job of porting it to the PC means I cannot recommend this to PC users. Buy it on a console, keep it on the console, do not bother PC users with this none sense. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game made by fans for fans. If you're not a hardcore WH 40k fan - dodge this at all costs. The architecture of levels (not level design, but actual design) is great, it feels massive and a lot of love is put into it. Voice acting is good, so are the movies. Everything else is more suitable for a $10 indie game. Enemies are common and stupid, there are no physics, your squad is stupid, guns are generic, everything about the gameplay is stupid, srsly, Serious Sam 1 was more fun with that type of gameplay. Menu looks like it was made by a highschooler, upgrade system too. Relics found only have a name, no flair text, no explanation - nothing.
This game should be treated as Spacehulk tourist simulator, nothing more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Playing this game was very boring. After 8 hours of playing retail version I simply uninstalled it, because there were no fun. Game is not interesting for me as old settlers fan, but for RTS strategy fans too. .I would rate: Graphics 9 of 10, GamePlay 1/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't know what to expect from this game... It was my firs time with this title and the feeling after spent 6 hours of game playing is... miserable! Graphic ok, but the collection of resources and battle is boring in best hand... I have uninstalled it after seven, long, and painful hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, it's not Settlers. I don't know why were the developers replaced the Settlers gameplay with this, because it's not so good. The campaign is boring. Very boring. The skirmish is worse. There is no AI. Yes, you read it good. There is no AI. I played on a skirmish map for nearly 1 and a half hour and then I discovered that the enemy is standing and doing nothing (like Patrick Star). Anyway the economic system is a failure too. The workers (I think they are slaves, because they don't need beds to sleep or food to eat, maybe they are aliens) are gathering resources too slow, terribly slow. This thing makes the game horribly boring. Maybe watching the wall for 2 hours is more exciting. To say something good, the graphics are pretty good. But it's not enough, because the gameplay is bad and the whole game is way too boring. A bad game, don't buy it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If not for Fuzion Frenzy 2, it would be the worst game I've played on the 360. The controls are terribly aggravating, the voice acting forces you to mute the TV, and it's just not fun. I knew it wasn't supposed to be very good when I rented it, but I didn't expect it to be quite this bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just buy metroid zero mission instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SH is archaic in a bad way. Compared with todays board-games SH was victim of its time, gaming-culture and the limitations of table-top miniature games. This computer-game is a port of SH the board-game, interpreted with clunky, cartoonish graphics with over-saturated colors.
Full Control Studios don't add anything to gameplay, and they fail miserably at coining the atmosphere of exploring a WH40 space hulk. Welcome to glossy coloured warhammer, where space marines spend their spare time polishing and waxing each others helmet, and the genestealers are polite enough not to leave any clawmarks or scratches anywhere, instead making sure to keep the dust from collecting in the hallways. No wonder they are attacking those humans, as their helmets obviously aren't clean enough and they have to chase them away to keep their beloved hallways dirt-free.
They've priced this at 30 euro, where 3 euro would be appropriate. Don't buy this game, FCS does not deserve your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being a fan of the board game back in the day i was looking forward to playing this......kind of wish i hadn't bothered. Given how much PC's have moved on you would have expected something a little more polished than this, very disappointing, slow and clunky and considering the £20 price tag expected much more! Made it through the first few missions but can't be bothered with it any more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having played Bloodbowl, another Games Workshop board game converted to video game, my expectations were not very high but I'm still disapointed,  The game is ugly, slow, clunky and just not fun to play.  If you're looking for some XCOM: Enemy Unknown style action, pass this one over or at least wait until it's a five dollar special. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the Warhammer universe when I was young.  I was hoping this would recover some of the wildly exotic compelling feel of the board game with all its subtle tactical opportunity.  I have no got very far into it yet and may never do so. I like relative difficult strategy but this is just linear, limited and tedious.  So far each level seems more like some annoying chore to get through in the hope something better pops up. I keep telling myself "surely, it cant be that crap".   This is what happens when middle aged men that are just doing the 9 to 5 make a game.  No innovation, lots of limitation and fk all imagination applied.  Hard to make something this bad out of Warhammer but somehow they have done that at least very well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even after all the alleged patch fixes this game is still crashy and broken.

Space Hulk's play is true to the board game which is good if that's what you're expecting (and I did) but controlling the terminators is just so tedious.  Setting the animation speed up makes them look silly but setting it to normal makes them turn more slowly than an actual scale guy in power armour.

The sound is nice but the graphics are.... poor.  Even when set to fantastic it looks more like a fan tribute than a retail game.

Save your money and play the original. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its like a "how to" of terrible game making. It is so much less than a direct port of the board game. every little part of this game is lazy. Play is slowed down to a crawl by the slow nature of the game. Rather than building atmosphere it just becomes infuriating. A typical example would be the need to manually go to every marine with spare action points and click overwatch when you are just camping, every single turn, for every marine. A simple check all button would fix this. The terrible production values are evident everywhere from the need to wait until the game is caught up for the end turn button to work, to the terrible and I mean Terrible graphics.
An utter lack of any original thought into this game means no special modes such as playing the Genestealers in the campaign or even a map builder.
This would be an ok release if it were a mere indie release for say £5, but it costs the same as any other triple A game! Its like paying £30 for candy crush, if candy crush was boring. Its an insult.
Avoid paying for this game at all, even as a special offer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's just painfully bad.

It smacks of a cheap cash-in on a beloved franchise.
I wanted to love this. I ignored the bad reviews, but you cannot. It looks like garbage. It plays terribly. The controls suck. It needed love and it never got any.
Play frozen synapse. Play XCOM. Play ANYTHING but this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've waited for this game for a long time, endured the hype, and paid 60 dollars for crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stupid story, overcomplicated controls, lots of bugs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An abysmal, broken, unfinished, unworthy game. Almost unplayable because of horrendous controls, full of bugs and glitches. Save your money. Believe me: avoid like plague! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a successor to Ninja Gaiden 1 & 2 this is a tragedy. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. Note: I started playing the story after the claw and scythe were made available, but while they definitely do add to the game it's simply not enough. This is not a Ninja Gaiden sequel. This is Call of Duty: Ninja Gaiden. The game plays like this. Walk forward, respond to quicktime event (QTE), walk forward, mash the X button to defeat wave of enemies, climb wall, mash X some more, jump down, mash X even more,defeat boss, watch uninteresting cutscene, repeat ad nauseum. At no point did I feel like I was truly in control of Ryu. The combat has been extremely dumbed down. It's almost impossible to pull away from a group and target a single enemy since the game pretty much decides that for you. Seriously, all you have to do is hammer X repeatedly for 8 hours with a few slides thrown in here and there- there's absolutely no challenge. On the higher difficulties I found myself dying constantly, but only because of my inability to triage thanks to the games autotarget taking nearly all of the control out of my hands. I have no idea how many times I would go out of my way to rush the guy with the rocket launcher only to have Ryu spin on his heels and the attack the dude chasing directly behind me as soon as I made an attack input simply because the game decreed it so.The skilled and tactical approach to each encounter from the previous games has been entirely erased. Slam on the X button, if you get surrounded slide out of the huddle, then slam X even more. When your arm glows red hit Y. You just beat the game. There's no need to jump off of walls for more powerful strikes, no need to memorize combos, no need to know what weapons work best in what scenarios - just beat the living hell out of the X button. There are WAY too many QTEs and they seriously break the game's flow, and even a few hours in the game constantly reminds you to press LT to block/X for light attack/Y for heavy. If you turn these off in the menus it also turns off the QTE prompts leading to you having to guess whenever one pops up (every 2-3min). Kunai climbing is annoying, rope climbing is entirely pointless, I could go for days. On top of all of this the framerate is horrible, the camera is way too close making it worse than it ever was, some parts of the game are extremely underlit and it took forever to get the brightness settings correct, the game is so easy the only way you'll really die is from enemies with cheap and unblockable throw attacks, there isn't much variety to the enemies, etc etc. It's obvious this game was simplified and streamlined to attract the casual crowd which was a failed attempt unless you're looking for a completely mindless action game, and a ton of emphasis was placed on actually telling a story. Unfortunately that doesn't bode well either as this one, like the previous two, is nonsensical and forgettable. This game sucks and doesn't deserve to bear the Ninja Gaiden name. What little fun to be had here is marred by extremely shallow combat, technical shortcomings, an asinine attempt at a story, and complete lack of legitimate challenge. The first 2 NGs were deep, challenging games that I initially sucked at only because I wasn't good enough... yet. As the games went on they seemed to get easier, but the truth was that I was just getting better. NG3 lays down and spreads its legs for you as soon as you put the disk in the tray without making you earn it. Just keep pressing X. I want my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know HOW people are giving this passing scores.  This game is terrible as a Ninja Gaiden.  And YES, I did play through to the end, on hard no less. In comparison to the other 2, it falls flat on it's face.  It's designed to take a hard-core, combo-based, intense, intelligent battle system and mainstream it for the more casual crowd.  There is no need to learn the combos at all, the action is all based around cheaply exploiting big multi-kill moves, the story is terrible, any RPG element felt in the other 2 (upgrades and items and stuff) is completely gone....I could go on all day.  Point is, terrible game.  NG 1 or 2, pre-owned, will end up being more valuable than this bargain-bin game.  Don't waste your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have now played through this twice with an open mind to see if I've missed something. I don't believe that I have. This game is extremely repetitive and without any of the leveling up of weapons, health bar or ninpo, lacks any sort of payoff. The control is sloppy and the enemies, when difficult (which is very rare) are only difficult due to what feels like AI cheapness.  In the previous games, when you died, you at least felt like it was fair. I didn't block in time. I should have dodged away etc. In this, I felt as though I kept cursing the design, rather than the enemies or their tactics. In my opinions, Ninja Gaiden Sigma was the best iteration of the original. It had all the content of Black with better graphics and tons of extras. They cut out nothing. In Sigma 2, you were given an extra sword and a few throw away levels but so much was cut out (including the blood). If this progression is to be expected from the new Team Ninja, Ninja Gaiden 4 will be an empty box with no game and you will have to purchase every level and pay with points whenever you want to save. This is a failure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wether or not you compare Ninja Gaiden 3 to previous Ninja Gaiden game is a bad game, it is not only stripped from the elements that made NInja Gaiden such an awesome franchise, but as far as the game as a whole goes, it just doesn't work, bad controls, extremely repetitive gameplay, etc. Sometimes I even get the thought that somebody in Team Ninja simply decided to deliberatly mess the game up as hard as possible for some reason, i know it's weird thought, but the game is that bad.

Compared to NG1 and NG2 the game simply isn't in the same league, but even then i'd grab most any'ol generic hack'n slash game over NG3 almost any day. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An utter disappointment.  Ninja Gaiden has always been a very elegant game when it comes to fighting.  The fighting was almost graceful, where you had complete control over what you did.  Ninja Gaiden 3 took a crap on that idea and produced a button masher with almost no control over what is really happening.  Also I found the fighting to be so jumpy that several times I found myself completely confused as to where I was at in the fight.  I have loved Ninja Gaiden since the NES, and I bought every version of the Ninja Gaiden reboot; but this was an utter disappointment and may spell the end of a great gaming franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, just wow. I've completed the game now and im speechless.

This has the be one of the biggest letdown i've seen. The game is just stupid.

AI is just a big laugh, enemies misses you with the gun even if your standing still.

The menu and the items are gone, no secret items. Nothing that gives you a rush to continue the game.
Its just similar action for stupid rich kids who arent a real hardcore game. Its a huge copy of God of War.

Just quicktime events on bosses and enemies, stupid events all the time.

And i  hate quicktime events, its the most stupidiest thing i've experienced. You just press X all the time in the entire game then finishes it off with some lame quicktime buttons.

Im so  dissappointed now and I WILL sell the game forward, im not usually someone who sells my game but this is just embarrassing to keep in my collection.

Hands down, if your a true Ninja Gaiden fan  you wont bother with this game.

If your a incompetent little  who likes everything served on a plate  enjoy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lost Planet 3 is very disappointing. When I first got my hands on it I thought that it was going to bring the Lost Planet series back from the dead. But sadly LP3 is just LP2 with a different story line. The graphics are the same, the enemies are the same, really everything is the same. And don't even get me started about the countless bugs and glitches. Why would they release a new game for the Xbox 360 and the PS3 when the Xbox One and the PS4 are right around the corner? With horrid graphics and bland story line I expect this to be a flop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the first space 4x game I tried, after 20 years experience playing Civ-style games, including Alpha Centauri and Pandora First Contact. This game is generally pretty bad, and I couldn't bear it for longer than 1 hour.

Pros:
- it must be a 4x game with some interesting stuff inside which I couldn't see

Cons:
- horrible graphics, music and GUI design. Why is this game not freeware? I'm pretty sure they could get better graphics even for free, by getting a few students who needed projects for their portfolios.
- the tutorial consists of long series of modal dialogs which you have to read and click thru until you actually can start doing the required action, and there is so much info and everything is so poorly explained that usually by the time the sequence of the tutorial popups would finally come to its end, I would be just completely confused. I wouldn't even remember what needs to be done now, and where to find the buttons, or why this even needs to be done - I mean what the game tries to get me to achieve. Funny enough, I struggled for a minute not knowing how to close the messages list, blocking the solar system from view, as there is no "X" button for that and tutorial just says "close the message list". The tutorial doesn't highlight the buttons you need to press, and since the GUI is horribly designed, with no tooltips or anything, and tons of stuff placed on a single screen, I progressed thru tutorial at a snail pace, searching thru ugly undescriptive messages and buttons, had to restart it once to be able to re-read a passage. When a battle started, I couldn't find my ship or the enemy, and was forced to give up and press Auto. The second time I got stuck at some place I don't even remember now. So I just rage quit. What a piece of trash really!

I have an impression this game was made by some asocial math professor who is also pretty bad at teaching (and most students skip his lectures anyway because they are useless). Hardly anyone tested this game before release apart from the author. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted this game to rock, but it's a buggy piece of **** and I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it.

First, after 8 hours of playing it, it randomly deleted my savegame despite me exiting the game normally.

The fool that I was, I decided to play it again, and this time, after the third mission, the "repair" function just stopped working on the silencer on guns, making the game useless and pointless to play (imagine your sniper shot being heard loud and clear each time you shoot someone.)

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

As for gameplay, the game has a ridiculously long load time and the much-touted "open world" is pointless. It's mostly empty and the only thing you get to do is drive around in your buggy. It's like the devs heard that "open world" is the big thing and threw it in there. Unlike Far Cry, you cannot climb up most hills unless the surfaces have special ledges for you to hang on, which appear only when you press Ctrl near them. Buildings too are a pain to climb. Most can't be climbed.

Save your money. Buy another game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While not as hyped as a Ubisoft Product this game comes with just as many bugs. The "CryEngine" has always been a resource hog but this game is using 10Gb+ of physical ram and will continue to use more if I add more sticks. On-top of the horrible frame rates which admittedly could be my GPU's even with two Geforce 650TiB im getting under 25fps with everything set to low and resolution at 1600x1080 thats right I cant even run at 1900+ yet my gpu's are only at 50-60% usage.  Moving on this game has its share of bugs with in the first 10-20minutes of game play I was hanging on fences not a full foot off the ground. Falling through church roof tops trying to get a vantage point while evading mines that dont stay marked after you "Scout" them. This game goes so far as to have a gear reset quest, nothing as bad as giving you all the awesome gear then taking it away after a lengthy and unnecessary prologue that frankly I don't care about, which if this foreshadowing is any indicator the "Ghost" is the main protagonist's baby brother. The game actually has a quest that makes you give up all the gear that you have acquired and purchased and has at no point a POI, Quest (side-quest or main) that allows you to go back and pick everything back up that you put in a random dumpster under a windmill that has no discernible marker! I would have given this game a much higher score had it not forced a silencer mechanic into the game that didn't even need to be there in the first place! Having said that I really had high hopes for this game unfortunately I personally feel it feel 9ft short of a 10ft hurdle; thus I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone that enjoys first person shooters especially with the memory leak 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A below average game. Someone has cynically created a game to jump on the tower defence bandwagon knowing that this alone may sell it.  However, it is just plane boring, dull and limited with limited control and precious little to recommend it.  I want to balance this out with some positive to say about it and all I can think of is that its quite pretty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Concept of the game is very good but game plan is too bad.
1. You can't take over the game even if you played well, every missions are too much depended on pre-planned scenario.
2. Limited towers, troops & resources.
3. (2x) mode doesn't work at all.
4. Controls are half in keyboard & half in mouse, very hard to remember them while playing & its pretty bothering.
5. No fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cool customisation but unfortunately there is nothing to do once you've made something. Really, really repetative game play - it's all a rehash of 'Go to point A, Collect item X, Go to point B, Drop item X, rinse and repeat'. Severe balancing issues with the weapons, handling issues with the vehicles and sub-standard graphics for the PC spec it needs. It's a really generic shooter that feels 5 years out of date in the current PC gaming market. Potential in the fact that its a maintained, persistent online game? The developers say they will 'take the community's comments, ideas and wishes consideration'. Perhaps they should have researched what we wanted BEFORE making us pay for their product? 'We don't know what customers want' is no excuse for releasing a poorly designed product. Overall I'm disappointed with a game that had a lot of potential and has been let down by poor design. If they put as much innovation into the game play as they have done with the customisation, it could have been revolutionary. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is good for mic chat and friend ability, really has nothing to warrant a long term pay structure and 40v40 is not mmo i mean i can play san andreas 200 v 200. Mechanics are like a Crimecraft(free game) without the roll so even more stale. Good to talk trash on the mic overall good game but wouldn't recommend buying for the persistence payments. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's basically a game with a pretty setting, and a boring, repetitive game play aspect. Don't expect to get very much from playing this game, because you won't.Unless you're the type that actually likes repetitive games.+2 for the nice graphics and customization.-8 for the boring everything else.I really hope they manage to turn this game around. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm gonna give it 2, and thats for customisation options. the most fun i had was picking some clothes. this game should not be charging money from people to play. i kept looking at it and thinking "shall I, or Shant I" i did decide to buy it sadly. dont regret spending the money but im gonna give up on mmorpgs now and stick to Xbox 360. i wish it wasnt so rediculous to play. not structured at all unlike WOW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe it was lad, maybe it was launch week load... maybe I just suddenly suck... but all I did was die, helpless to even hit my enemies. The graphics were surprisingly sub-par given how nice it looked in screen shots, but I didn't see many options to turn up... I really want to like this game. The ideas are fantastic, action based, no levels, 1/3 of the gameplay area devoted to social interaction... but so far it just falls flat. I'll try again in a month and see if it was just the pains of launch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not just an APB review, it is also an APB reloaded review.First let me explain why this review is bad. Every single element of gameplay was either improperly coded, poorly thought out, or just not worth trying to add in to begin with.Yes the game had potential but it screwed up in many various aspects.1. The games combat is so horrible, the weapon calibration is screwed up, all you need to do is have a smg or less than leathal weapon (as enforcer) then strafe around hosing the enemy down. Less than lethal weapons are horribly imbalanced and in the end they make it difficult for criminals to win. The simple fact is, a weapon with moderate accuracy that can take an entire team out of the game and be unable to do anything for twenty to thirty seconds is something that should have not been added in that situation.2. Cars do not explode, great concept but the movies lie and it was a mistake to add this, instead they should stop working after taking enough damage.3. Enemies can take 20 direct hits from an assault rifle and live. Do I really need to explain this one? It is a very common example of horrible coding skills from very bad developers. I am a coder myself (C++), its not hard to not screw this up.4. RPG in a game of cops vs criminals, yeah I know they can have smuggled weapons and all of that but seriously, an RPG? Yeah... No...5. Horrible controls for the cars, some cars its nearly impossible to turn a corner under any circumstance let alone even out the car, especially the muscle cars.6. Horrible spawn locations every two to three missions. Sometimes I am spawned 500 meters away from an objective area that I am supposed to be guarding and it takes roughly 20-30 seconds to take an objective while it takes 5 seconds to hijack a car and another 40 seconds to get back to the objective point. And when the combat system is so broken this is a problem. Other times it spawns me right in front of an enemy car, they want till my spawn invulnerability is down and then ram me, oh yeah and there is no cover I can get behind to evade them at that point since its an open area.7. Ranking system is broken as well, no hack protection either. This creates a problem when it goes hand in hand. When there are hackers who are unable to be removed in an appropriate and quick manner and you can rank down there is the stench of a broken game.I hate to say it but the gameplay mechanics just are the worst of the worst, the only reason this gets a 2 from me is that it is a great concept, the world is average when constructed, the music is ok for the theme of the game (save I would have added a lot more techno, rap, and industrial to match the theme of the game).This game will require an entire rebuild in order to make it worthwhile, and again keep in mind this also means APB reloaded. Both are horrible, and both should not have been released. The Publisher of APB should feel bad for releasing a broken product, the devs should never be given a job again, and the people who bought the rights to APB to turn it into APB Reloaded should be shut down. This is simply how horrible the product is.

Mario Tennis Utra Smash was deliberately rushed for the Christmas season. It is bare bones and the weakest of the series. Hopefully Nintendo will fix this with a free download. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They basically took out all of the Mario in it, added two gimmicks, and drained it of all the fun. There seems to be no reason for this game existing. 3DS tennis had things to do, GC had memorable animations and a real tournament, this thing just has scaling changes for no benefit or use. This feels like one of those bad fan made games someone put together over a weekend. x.x 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is no way around it, Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash was clearly a rushed game. While the game may pass as a normal tennis game, offering solid tennis gameplay, that's about all it passed for. It does not pass as a MARIO Tennis game. The game lacks different modes, such as a tournament mode or special games and diverse and creative courts, instead sticking you in the same stadium with different skins. The character roster was only decent, but still questionable in some areas. The so called "new" mechanic of the Mega Mushroom is just a stale idea that's was already used (better) in Mario Kart Wii and the Ultra Smash move is just a glorified flat shot that's harder to hit. Overall, this game is an empty game lacking everything long time Mario Tennis fans love. You're better off getting the N64, GameCube or even the 3DS Mario Tennis titles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just empty. There are few game modes which are either boring or too short. The only thing this game has going for it is the amino functionality which is actually quite useful for once. This game has no replay value and I have no wish to return to this game whatsoever.This game simply feels rushed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rubbish if you enjoyed Athens 2004 on the ps2 and were expecting a game that is very similar you would be very wrong. the many problems about this game are the controls which are extremely difficult and take hours to get right most people just want to pick this game up and play it with their mates. avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One user gave this game a perfect '10' and said "Ignore all the old Silent Hill fans that are Butt hurt that there (sic) game is changing"....That's nonsense.  First, I call BS on anyone who would give this game a perfect score.  A '5' or a '6'?  Everyone is different, so maybe.  But a '10'?  No.  He gave it a '10' to try and counterbalance all the 0s, 1s, and 2s this game will get.  Second, the reason why people are calling this game garbage is because it's a bad game.  Not because anyone is 'Butt hurt' over the series changing.  It's a bad game.  Period.  No need to try and make up silly reasons for why people don't like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to say, i'am very very very delighted with the combat sequence, it also allows dual wield and special powers, and i have to say i really really loved the new combat gameplay. As for the game itself, it is BLASPHEMY of the "Silent Hill" name. The story is bogus, and has nothing to do with Silent Hill, what? just because they placed notable monsters in Silent Hill makes the game Silent Hill? The Silent Hill game is about the psychological horror and terror, the tense feeling as you solve puzzles in an even scarier environment, and the plot-wise and excellently written story, that is what Silent Hill is all about.

The environment is good, but it's not even scary. And because the protagonist IS powerful, people are much more inclined to stand their ground and NOT be afraid of the monsters. Although i like the idea of customizing your character to give a sense of attachment to the players, all these great ideas went to nothing because of the bogus way they did the game. This is Blasphemy to the Silent Hill name, this is what happens when asian-geniuses surrender their work of art to the western-action-oriented-idiots. The Silent Hill from 1, 2,3,4: rooms, Zero/Origins, Downpour, Shattered Memories, and Homecoming... They all deserve the "Silent Hill" name, not this game.

Although i kind of suggest these changes: - Gameplay Camera - return the original camera to the third person mode, so that players will actually see the horrific environment from the inside, cause form the outside it looks like crap, like playing a movie in an IPad at the theater for the whole audience to see.
- Make the protagonists walk, and hold a button to run.
- Make the enviroment lighting darker, making the Flashlight very important.
- Make the Radio for players, so that they are aware of nearby monsters.
- Make the monsters really powerful, though can be brought down by couple of hits, they should bring you down by couple of hits too, making them dangerous.
- Make the hud somewhat smaller, or even gone.
- The "Dream" sequence is really really really stupid, it's not even that scary. What should be done is that, after closing the book when they have written what they want, the "SIREN" blares and everything shifts to the Otherworld. Monsters then barge in the door but valtiel stops them and tells you the thing you have to do.
-I also understand that you want the game to be "Competitive" but, that doesn't really make the game "Silent Hill". Although it is fine for me, but i suggest as a multiplayer feature, but the main Single-player SHOULD be played by one player only.
- Add sequences that showcase the psychological-horror.
- Lastly make the environment have intractable corpses and gores or whatever psychotic things that can be places; maybe a human chained in the wall gutted alive and is still alive. or rather is in that sense.

hoping that at least the game will be at least playable. Because WayForward ruined This installment of Silent Hill for me.

Although yes, some people like the idea of Silent Hill being that kind of game, but then my guess is they haven't even played the original game and understood the story of every Installment. I bet they don't even know what Harry Mason or James Sunderland suffered or their stories in the original Game. I bet they didn't even know that Heather Mason is the reincarnation of Alessa. I hope you people consider to play the original games, and understand them before you try and judge this game too... because i can guarantee you new-comers to the Silent Hill, you have not grasp the story behind this shady resort town. WayForward made a mockery of Silent Hill. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute Mess.
This game is a complete disaster. It is not silent hill, it is more like Diablo or something, but NOT silent hill. This game is terrible. Long load times, bad graphics, bad voice acting, boring story, eye straining camera angles, and so so so much more. This is terrible. This is the final straw. I will NEVER buy a konami game every gain or silent hill. I loved silent hill until konami DESTROYED IT. Silent Hill 1-4 were amazing. Origins was horrible and had bad graphics, homecoming was super glitchy, shattered memories was boring and had no combat actions, downpour was boring, and dont get me started on the horrifying mess of SH HD Collection, what a mess that was... konami, fix the series. NEVER release something like this again. All the fans asked for it to be canned, you did not listen. Let the bad reviews pour in now... Even AMY was better then this disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a let down! I bought this game thinking it would be like Max Payne on fire w/ ninja monkeys chasing after me with big deadly knives but instead I waited almost 2 years for this piece of garbage! This game should suffer the same fate as E.T. for Atari 2600 but b/c of all the fat Matrix fan-dorks we have to watch people rot their brains over this! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game deserves a 2.

I'll grant it 2 points for it's battle system which is seamlessly tied into the world and was refreshing because you didn't have to stow or manage character participants. Everyone participated 100% of the time which means that there were no "wasted builds" or situational regrets for not having someone in the party due to simply being a first-time player. The SP system allowed for adequate grinding and the option to trade exp. for other elements was a good move plus the title system felt intuitive and it made sense to build certain roles and gave expected results.

I'll deduct 2 points for the story which was rushed and the pacing was poor. The beginning of the game was fine, very standard pacing, but the middle of the game really felt dry regarding the whole "daddy" element and going ten minutes in game play between the beginning of that conflict and the end including the revenge which felt awkward at best. Same with the whole final dungeon; it just never felt like a final dungeon and when I played it I felt let down to say the least.

I'll deduct 2 points for the music. Some of it was in previous games for the dungeons and obviously so. It felt lazy to me and the original tracks were just not good to begin with. Unacceptable.

I'll deduct 2 points for the Characterization. They characters had awkward depths and massive inconsistencies. It never panned out correctly. Fidel and daddy for instance was just not good for an In Media Res type relationship and nothing really came of the whole system of individuals. Nothing felt too terribly compelling.

I'll deduct 2 points for the environments. Again, beginning of the game, it was standard and semi-interesting but soon it becomes clear there are no maps. The number of areas in the game is fewer than any of the previous games and even if "larger" that size difference doesn't make up for the diversity problem. You went from field to field. You had four or so legitimate dungeons on Faykreed: Signescila, Slaughtery, Kronos 1 and 2. That's it. There are actually no other dungeons in the game. All other areas are throughports including W. Dekaav Tunnel.

Overall there was no glue to the game to make it an RPG. I still love the game's seamless battle system and I almost rated it higher because of the weight it has in my enjoyment but being fair and keeping things even I realized rather swiftly that I wish I had just Gamefly'd it and sent it back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a very low grade JRPG from an industry that has failed to innovate. The writing and character development is juvenile and lacking when compared to games like Witcher 3 and Dragon Age. The game play is a complete joke compared to games that offer tons of choices and open ended approach to situations like Divinity the original sin. The graphics are nice so it gets a 2 in that area. Skip this and save your 60 bucks.

Note: Please hit my username and see my other reviews and like if you find them useful.

I played through this game and simply asked myself, "Why did they do this?" There's just too many poor decisions from the developers of this title that really made me shake my head in disgust.

I've played through Star Ocean since its second game. This game runs well on my PS4. I didn't observe any dips in my framerate. Cut scenes in this game mostly occur while you're in control of your character, kind of like a third-person version of Half-Life 2.

One shortcoming is that the game is just too short. It's not like a typical JRPG. Sometimes, I'd have my characters level up 10 times within a single dungeon. The storyline is very short, being only 20 hours. It's approximate to the length of The Last Story for the Wii, if you've played that title.

Due to all battles occurring in the open world, the camera does have issues in certain places, somewhat like in Tales of Zestiria. The save points are acceptable in number, but they become locked during cut scenes. This is bad because there are instances where there's a boss, then a lengthy cut scene, then another boss, and you won't be able to save your game even though you see the save point.

Compared to the previous title, this world is extremely linear. There is a fast travel system, but it's unlocked near the ending of the game. It's sad because there are plenty of side quests with optional mini-boss enemies, but it becomes annoying to run through the areas you previously visited to get there. Before you unlock fast travel, it's annoying because you may need to go through 4 or 5 maps to get from one city to another. There is an item creation system, but if the town you're in doesn't have the item you need, you'll need to spend a while going across the world to get to the city selling that item.

There are "private actions", which are optional cut scenes where you can observe the protagonists interacting with each other. They're handled abysmally, with most of them not even being relevant to the story. There are about 300 - 400 private actions, and you need to run in and out of a building to unlock them because only one or two will show up at a time. Can you imagine running in and out of a building hundreds of times? One of the private actions had one character, standing alone, simply uttering the word, "kitty". Compared to the previous title, private actions are handled horribly. The previous title had only a dozen private actions, but each one there was actually a complete 5 - 10 minute cut scene that would be extremely relevant to the plot.

People were very disappointed by this title, myself included. Often I see on message boards, "How far am I? I'm on the first planet," to which people would sadly respond, "There's only one planet", which is disappointing for a science fiction series of this calibre.

The new game plus feature also could've been better. There are lore entries that are interesting to read, and the game records all enemies and items into the menus for you. But, although those records are kept when you make a new game, you need to pretty much collect everything else again. This title would've benefitted if they borrowed ideas on how the Tales series implemented the new game plus feature. Since most cut scenes are done while in control of your character, you'll have to spend hours waiting on scenes you've already seen if you want to replay the game. I would've liked to play the game on the hardest difficulty immediately, rather than having to go through two complete playthroughs just to unlock the hardest difficulty.

There are several escort missions in the game, where you'll instantly lose and be forced to reload your save if one particular character dies. It becomes very frustrating because all of the enemies will instantly only target that one particular character and you'll be forced to find ways to "break" the game. Often you'll find minibosses during these escort sequences. This game actually has difficult/long boss battles, but very easy regular battles, somewhat like in the game Arc Rise Fantasia. It's just poor game design. You'll see random difficulty spikes throughout the game because of it and often you'll need to look up information online to find a way to beat the game.

If you're a fan of JRPGs and the Star Ocean franchise, buy it when it goes down in price. At first I thought all the hate was unwarranted, but even as I played through the game I felt bored, to the point where I'd bring my laptop and watch a show while running through an old dungeon again to get to the city due to no fast travel for the majority of the game.

Looking ahead, it seems this title confirmed that both the Star Ocean and the Valkyrie Profile series are dead. To be fair, Star Ocean was pretty much dead from its fourth game's poor reception anyways. It's an utter shame, since the majority of the JRPG IP's from my youth have been laid to rest. Another one bites the dust.

Wow, what a waste of money, Let alone the $8.99 I wasted on this junk and gamers you know there are much better games out there then God Mode for less money.. This game tries to hard to be a shooter game and fails at it poorly. Haven't yet been able to play a co-op game since no one one my friends list  purchased this crap, but I still feel that it will not change the boring game play what so ever.  The leveling up weapon system is a big joke  its seems like its only there to keep you interested in playing the game and without that it would fail even more. The way the maps are setup and where you can go and the enemy can be, you'll find yourself looking up on top of one the building fixtures trying to shoot a crappy ass weapon a long distance in order to kill them and unable able to reach them. You start with the worst weapon so get use to that until you can purchase a better one which takes a long while and alot of yawning. The game tries to bring a changed to each map by making the enemies smaller, or changing your weapon every so many seconds and other attempts to change the way you play, but still does not make this game fun at all. Save your money or wait for a 75% off sale this way you will not be upset when you play this junk.

Money saving time! No point in buying this game. Especially considering you can play games like Warframe for free (and it's better than this thing).

Low budget doesn't have to mean bad, but it really is an incoherent spamfest that you pretty much have to play coop in order for it not to be utterly ridiculous. I don't know why others were motivated to continue playing  so many better games out there, just why? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. Expect a lot of micro transactions and long waiting times for a game, then expect choppy frame rates and lagging. A horrible game best forgotten. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the auto aim killed this game on when you use sights its like you have an aim bot.....................................................................

+ + + Pros + + +
1. Modern version of arcade hits Smash TV, Total Carnage or Gauntlet
2. Nice cartoon graphics (plenty of various monsters)
3. Good music with 16bit feel

- - - Cons - - -
1. Bad controls (heavy inertia,no diagonal shooting,no auto pickup weapons)
2. Only for one player (no co-op)
3. Only 1 life for hardcore players only,who finished Smash TV with 1 credit (no lives or continues)

Good looking game,bad gameplay,wasted opportunity. How could this passed quality control? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Avoid at all costs!! Bad for you, your family and your future lives! You'll find yourself hammering the screen with your controller swearing words you don't even know what they mean. Pain, neverending pain! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrifying "game" if you are a whiny brat girl, stupid enough to call game to any **** like this. Bought on a dirty cheap pack, but there is no price low enough for this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Beautiful game, but simple. Which isn't bad. This game tries to capture a relaxing zen type of atmosphere, which it does... in STORY mode. I played story mode first and when I finished it, it felt a 7.5/10 type of game. Respectable. But then I played the challenges, and to unlock the further stages in challenges requires you to get stressed out. The challenges are hard af. Which takes away the zen/relaxing feel this game is trying to portray. So because you have to review an ENTIRE game (you cant just pick out things you liked, or else every game would be a perfect 10/10), it drops the score to a 2/10. It's like eating an apple pie... you bite into the crust and it's delicious, but you can't give that pie a 10/10... you have to try the apple part first.... well the apple part ends up being cherries instead. THAT is what this game is like. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Perhaps the worst Spyro game released. Etranges Libellules has progressively made worse games with this reaching an all time low. The old spyro games limited flight, and for good reason. The new feature has crippled the game severely and the poor geometry just adds to the confusion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is thoroughly unbalanced, boring, bugridden, close to impossible to play offline, and not likely to improve in the future. Ive reached out to the devs to see if any workarounds existed for the various bugs or if a patch was being worked on and never received a response, sony tech support told me to rebuild the vita database which didnt fix anything. You are left with agame that was meant to have microtransactions with gameplay meant for an iphone. Its disapointing because tycoon games are sorely lacking and the vita seems like a great place to put them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is NOT worth the buy. The physics are a joke, the turning is way too loose, unnecessary crashes, the graphics are ok, and the terrain is trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lucius is an example of how difficult it is to make a game even when you have a brilliant idea.  The puzzles are contrived and the game plays on rails.  Three levels and fifteen minutes was enough for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hated it. It was a horrible game. It is very disturbing, and very gross. Why make a kid kill people?? Really? In another way, this sucked, very emberising, poorly made, and very disturbing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gameplay sucks - This looks like a last generation game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1. Gameplay - does not come close to how good NBA2K7's is. 2. Graphics - Players look better than 2K7's (which isn't saying much), but if the gameplay sucks, it doesn't matter. 3. Presentation - slightly better than 2K7's but again, the gameplay really hurts it. Conclusion - Thank God EA doesn't have an exclusive license to produce NBA games, like they do with the NFL. Compare the 2 NBA's and trust me, NBA 2K7 has it's faults but nowhere near how many faults NBA Live '07 does.

This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free "Pros & Cons" section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.

Pros:
+ Lovable characters in a charming setting
+ Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing
+ Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot
+ Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore

Cons:
- Frequent crashes (both random & reproducible)
- Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs
- Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX
- An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food & sleep were almost never needed)
- Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable
- Terribly timed and overused QTEs
- Tons of muddy, low-rez textures
- Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes
- A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game

Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.

Spoilers below, you have been warned!

I went into Deadly Premonition expecting "Resident Evil with FBI Agents" and instead received "Shenmu with Zombies". While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.

Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce "supernatural" elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 & 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.

All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.

While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with "Previously during the investigation..." segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The port is a total mess: low fps, no XBOX joypad support, really LOW graphics and to sum up  neverending crashes. I am not that optimistic about upcoming patches that will fix crashes, fps and will add xbox pad support, that's why I already refunded it... Score is 2 for intriguing intro... will change my score if the game will be patched as it should be and I'd be able to .play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its Exactly tha same as all other mediocre games..just without any good story. Lame ending. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a terrible, terrible game that fails completely on every level. Any "critic" that does not recognize this game outright for what it is (absolute garbage) should have his head examined. They are obviously cut and pasting the doom 3 engine, yet they somehow even managed to make the visuals more bland. Every aspect of this game fails. From the AI interaction, to the gameplay, the plot, the weapons, the sound. It feels like it was released in 2002 which is the only way it could have been taken seriously. I'm glad I got the demo. This is a game that would make you regret spending a dollar on. They should consider releasing it for free and just using product placement since it was obviously made to try and make a quick buck as opposed to having any relevance in today's fps market. I guess they can't all be half-life 2. A game like Alpha Prime makes you appreciate the good ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry. Worst purchase Ive made on XBLA so far. Not much replay value and some of the achievements are insanely hard. One of them requires you to beat a game of Solitare in under a minute. This basically means you have to spam buttons blindly hoping you have a clearable board that you can finish with nothing but luck. Gameplay is bland and the controls are not very well done. Instructions for most unfamiliar games are HORRIBLE leaving you to learn a game entirely on your own, or in some cases, never learning them. Buy Pac Man Championship or Root Beer Tapper instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is little I can say about this. All it is is boring and overpriced. Don't ever buy this. I don't know what else to say. I guess I need to be in the 150 character limit at the very least. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a really sad remake of Doom 3, Painkiller did a much better job with their Hell&Damnation edition

Doom I and Doom II, bad emulator, no multiplayer/lan-network

Lost mission is cool, but nothing new and easy done 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

5 games later and KOEI still hasn't put any effort into changing this game beyond what it was in Dynasty Warriors 2. The graphics are below PS3 and the 360's power, and the complete lack of any real progression in gameplay make this game almost interchangeable with the past iterations. If you're a huge fan, you'll probably buy it anyway. If you're looking to try out a Dynasty Warriors game for the first time, try one of the previous games, preferably either 3 or 5. They will be much cheaper and provide a slightly less monotonous experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found the game annoying from the first moment. The main character is the stereotypical maverick cop who doesn't play by the rules; the same character we've seen a million times by now. He's not interesting or compelling and I found myself rooting for the antagonist purely because he wasn't the protagonist. They stashed every single cliche into this game as well. And the gameplay is fiddly, too. You can keep clicking the 'talk' button on characters, because some of them have multiple lines, but it will replay the first line when you reach the last, so there's a huge amount of repetition. Most of the characters have nothing interesting to say at all. The walking through walls mechanic is cumbersome because you don't have a map to show you where you have and haven't been. As well as this, some walls are possible to walk through and others are not. There are impassable walls in the middle of buildings for no reason. You will find yourself walking into numerous doors because you can't figure out the bounds of the room.

You're repeatedly expected to find awkwardly placed clues in your levels, but you're not allowed to leave the level until you uncover an arbitrary number of clues. For some reason.

And even though it's a graphically good game, they didn't do much with the technology. The aesthetic is pretty ugly. It's not nice or chilling or atmospheric, just ugly.

And don't get me started on the Salem witch fiasco. Not only do the 'witches' speak in a 21s century american accent, which didn't really exist in the 1600s, but they're actually explicitly linked to witchcraft and ghostery. Even though the salem witch trials were brutal and tragic murders borne out of suspicion, in which many innocent women died, this game decides to insult their deaths. Even though witch craft in the 1600s involved **** on satanic idols and **** the devil, they thought it was a smart thing to include them in this game. As if they weren't murder victims. It's so obnoxiously crass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Remember that PS1 game "Independence Day" from the movie... Well this game is just like that... only more of a waste of graphics and time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Je m'attendais à un nanar mais à ce point, ça défie l'entendement. Gros problème de caméra, trop proche et qui peut même se retrouver bloquée par un élément du décor (!) c'est dingue ! et on ne peut pas regarder en haut : ils ont décrété que c'était inutile. Et l'imprécision globale permanente des combats le place très en dessous de jeux non spécialisés dans le genre tels que les Batman AA/AC et Sleeping Dogs !

Dommage, c'est quand même rigolo au début malgré la réalisation d'un autre âge, le framerate souffreteux et le clipping. Les voix japonaises sont à se tordre et la musique rockeuse se laisse écouter, si, si, je vous jure. Je vais relire le manga, qui n'a jamais mérité une adaptation aussi pathétique. Pauvre Ken, s'il voyait ce truc, il se ferait hara-kiri. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i really dont like this game i got to level 3 and got bored of it i still havent touched it since and i have no intention of its too bad what were u thinking sega 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just finished this game. And I want that time of my life back. Not only is this game a disgrace to the Rainbow Six franchise, it is a disgrace to modern First person shooters. Take a look at Half-life 2 and Far Cry and you'll understand what AI is SUPPOSED to be doing. Take a look at Ravenshield, Athena Sword or Swat 4, and you see what a squad based shooter is SUPPOSED to be like. Sure the game is pretty. The sound is aweful. There should NEVER be a time when I have to edit a file to make my sound work properly. Thats just bad QA. The only reason I didn't give Lockdown a 1 is because I remotely enjoyed the multiplayer. That is when I could actually connect to a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yet another sterling example of style over any sort of substance. No wonder the slack jawed mouth breathers are giving it such high numbers. No mission planning, completely linear levels and apparently programmed without any AI at all. What a pathetic joke this game is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i agree with the yahoo review. do yourself a favour install ravenshield this game is a DUD! what were the developers thinking, do yourselves a favour and get a new line of work. youve done enough damage to the franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very bad. horrible recoil. ohh wait, when Ii played it had no recoil, only crosshair spread... an insult to the R6 name. This is not tactical at all. Atleast the halo fanboys like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I may be a poor gamer,this game gets very frustrating.I thought i had the principles down,then new scenarios seemed to be imposible to progress in. I am disapointed that no matter, i fail at the scenario,dispite trying all different plans of attack.Am i Just wasting my money?? Is everyone just as frustrated?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I paid $29.00 for this? Hey Atari and Chris Sawyer Join us in the year 2004 and leave the dated graphics behind. This was a substandard title full of AI bugs. A agree with an earlier post, Chris Sawyer should be ashamed of this release...It has tarnished my opinion of what I thought was a superior game designer. Enjoy the $29.00 it will be the last you get from me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only watched the tutorials and just a friendly word of advice to Mr. Sawyer: the audience that worshipped you for the TT series is not the bunch of commercial hoes that knew you from the RCT series. To everyone considering buying it, a serious word: DON'T! ..Now I know why it didn't get the TT label, it's got nothing to do with the TT series. No more dual tracks, no more ro-ro stations, no more clover crossings, no more complex signaling, no more continuous 100 years of playing(except for an expert scenario which has an objective just like every damn scenario in this stupid game or any one in the RCT series), no more fun. I want...no..I demand continuous non-objective oriented gameplay, I demand a complex construction engine, I demand more than purely graphical "sugar-coating"...I was going to rate it 3...but I'll just rate it 2 'coz I just figured out that this must only be a test for RCT3...either that or mocking the TT series' fans like myself...To put it clearly: EVERYONE STICK WITH TTD(Transport Tycoon Deluxe for the layman) AND LEAVE THIS ONE ON THE STORE SHELVES! Ditto. Cheers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was thrilled to hear about Transport Tycoon's sucessor, Locomotion, was to be released for XP, but after purchasing and playing it the game leave you yearning for the old TT back. Laying the track and managing the game is much more difficult and much less intuitive then Loco's predecessor. The simplistic fun has been replaced with tedious complexity which makes playing the game very frusterating. Anyone wanting to play a current Transport Tycoon should look elseware, this game just leaves you feeling frustrated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

IF they had upgraded TransportTycoon (Deluxe) with better graphics and some small other features a good game was born. Now we are building our own OpenSourceTransport Tyccon. Sorry Sawyer, bye bye to this CD-ROM for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a racing game with bad gameplay. Probably the worst Sonic out there. Want a racing game? Get F-Zero or Mario Kart, because this game sucks in gameplay. The cutscenes are boring, the history is terrible, and that's pretty much of it. Sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Looked cute, but brought my 9 year-old to tears of frustration trying to play. There's no "singing" in the game... just "frontman" controller wiggling that was no fun. Games aren't suppose to make kids sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What happened to the rush series!? This is terrible, not much fun. Cops are everywhere, traffic is crazy, almost always in your way. Hard to race when the track is full of these obstacles. Graphics will make you sick. Only thing good is the cars, using real licensed cars is fun, too bad they don't handle anywhere close to how they should. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game concept is unsound and out of date. very dull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved "Defender of the Crown" on my C-64 in the 1980's, but this game is an abomination compared to its noble roots. What boring sequences, and endless repetition. I actually prefer the 1980's model. Not exactly a positive development when we've had 20 or so years since the time of Cinemaware's original release to get this right! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

BR4 is soo bad that can't be compared to games like soul calibur 2 , Vf4. I gave 2 becuse there is so much better games than THIS!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I understand that many people like the idea of spending hour after hour fine tuning there car to go faster. I for one do not want to spend hours tweaking a car; I purchased this game to race not to play with settings. I know what you are all going to say then it isn't a real sim. Then once you get a car that can almost be driven around the track you have to deal with the AI that for some reason do not want to share the track with you. They constantly ram you from behind, as you are passing them you will just turn down into you for no reason. If you can look past all that the career mode is all but gone. I have played almost every nascar game there is. I do not want to spend hours doing meaningless tasks just to get a career. Wish they would go back to earlier career modes start at lower levels work your way up. The only positive is visually it is nice tracks look great cars look great. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Basically the game falls short in just about everything. The features are stripped from 07 (even 2003 had way more to do). Graphics are a minor improvement over the xbox 1 game - they do not compare favourably to other 360 games. There is no splitscreen multiplayer. I was annoyed when they moved from 4 player split screen, to 2 back in 2005. This one takes it too far, especially when the online multiplayer is a feature stripped, laggy, glitch filled mess. If this weren't bad enough, they altered the controls. Now the steering automatically turns to the left, and it can't be altered in gameplay settings (unless you tune each car). Some may argue this was added for realisim, but I say it was added for moronic purposes. It basically forces you to use a racing wheel or suffer. 'The Chase' is basically the new career mode. But unfortunately it forces you through a lot of repetitive license races before you get to actually race. I'd be into license races, if it had variety to the goals. The ai this year is the worst in the series yet - they do the same lines whether you are beside them or not, and don't react properly at all. Normally this would be a little early to rate and judge a game, but when so much is wrong, I'll commit to saying it's tterrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im old school in how i drive these things with the d pad with great successs, but with n08 the car is virtually undrivable and there is no option to play th e old way. Just an abomination need to work on the controls. Im glad i didnt buy this game merely rented it but it didnt take me long to reliaze it wasnt for me even though i had played all the previous nascar editions very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was easily sold on this game. You crash on an alien planet, there are mysterious things going on, explore and find out what happened. Sounds like the plot of a good sci-fi/horror movie. You soon discover that Russians had been on that planet a long time ago. Cartoon Russians apparently, because on the majority of their logs that you discover, they go on about how amazing the Motherland is and how glorious Communism is and how butthurt they are because a long time ago Americans landed on the moon first, so they are "getting back at them" this way... Really? That's Red Alert 3 levels of silly right there, and Red Alert 3 was a comedy. Yeah... Doesn't bode well for the story. Unfortunately, I did not finish the game so I can tell you where it all leads to, because the game is just insanely buggy. I fell through the world geometry 4 times in 2 hours, and had to reload and replay the entire areas, which are pretty big. One elevator caused my character model to freak out and become weirdly "magnetized", moving through the air even though I was standing still. On another elevator at the power plant level I fell through its floor while it was going up, every single time. I only managed to not fall by spamming the jump button while riding it. Also, while the game is very heavy on platforming, the physics and controls are extremely shaky. While running on some surfaces in order to make a long jump, your character suddenly, out of the blue, decides to slow down a bit, which causes you to miss the jump. I cannot express how frustrating this is, especially when the jump you miss is the 4th or 5th in a row and you have to restart the whole thing. At some point I decided that I shouldn't be playing a game that's broken and frustrating, when I could be playing a game that isn't. I think this game was made by one guy, but I really don't care. If you ask for 20$ for a game, you'd better at least make sure it's polished and that the player doesn't fall through everything. It's impossible to recommend this game at its current state. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At the start it tricks you into thinking it's about exploring the place, it's actually just following a straight path for hours with annoying sound effects and some **** excuses of a puzzle like "hurr durr the current is off I wonder if that lever two meters behind will turn it on again and you'll be able to proceed"
It's so boring I don't think the creators even bothered playing it through the end 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A disgrace to the NHL game franchise.
How can you EA release something which lacks so many features? (Yes, I know that they got scared, and they want to give more features in the future, but for god's sake then release the game when it is ready, and not now.)
If your product lacks the 80% of the features then write it down, and do not fool the people buying a non finished product.
The GM mode is a nonsense. Who had that wonderful idea, that for example you can not sim through periods?
In the previous nhl games if you sim a period you get stats what is happening/happened on the ice, who scored a goal, who is sitting in the penalty box, who shot more on goal etc.. Now I can NOT do that, I can just sim a whole match, and in a blink of an eye I get the result. Whaaat??
In the previous games, I had complete stats at the main screen about my team, who is the best goalscorer, who is the best in assists etc. Now it is gone. Why? Good question.
I did not know about the fact that I CAN'T choose people to DRAFT. I had two first round draft picks, and the system selected me TWO GOALKEEPERS.

Be a pro
It is amazing how EA can ruin everything. I loved be a pro, and I was happy that it is be a pro again, and not live the life with stupid text base interiews. Be a pro in the NHL franchise was for me always as it sounds, a game mode which can give you an epic adventure from being a rookie to be a superstar. This contains playing in junior league, and play good to have a good place in the draft. After that play as a 55-60 overall player on the farm team, get stronger, better, and be called up. I was shocked by the fact, that from the beginning I was part of an NHL team with 72!!! overal.
But why should I be mad about this. 90% of the players will never play this game mode, because it is completely ruined. You are forced to watch the computers playing their rubbish game until you get your shift again. Yes, the simmulation to your next shift is OUT, which made the game mode unplayable. And for EA is okay, because they want to add to be a pro only "tips from your coach how to be more succesful in the game"

Don"t spend your money on this. It is a very hard question what were the guys in EA thinking with this. That the people will cheer because of the new graphics system? (By the way that is realy nice, that is why I gave 2 points in my review.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I used to be a big fan of NHL, but this game is under my expectation.
Interface: It's not really bad, but when you want to choose a team, you have a lag (around 1 sec) between each team (time to generate the 3 D logo?) you select. It the same when you want to select the jersey for your team...
Game mode: You find the same modes than the other opus.

Game play. If everything before is ok, here is the main problem for me. The engine is really poor and the IA has a lot of bug. The game is made to generate hits on the ice...A lot of hits...Too many hits. We are closer to an arcade mode than a simulation. The tactical patterns are poorly represented and the engine for passes and shoots is one of the worst I saw. We are really far from the real life!

Graphics: There are good and they added some new features

Finally, it's really hard to me, but NHL 15 doesn't deserve a good mark.

(Sorry for my English, I'm french!!) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played NHL since the snes/genesis days and I can tell you that this game is without a doubt this worst version I have ever experienced. This game is absolute trash. This series reached its pinacle a few years back and has been on a downwards spiral the last few years. I think they have finally hit rock bottom.

The AI gets worse every year, not better like some people tend to think. I sometimes wonder if the developers have every watched a game of hockey in their lives. Just a couple of examples would be when the goaltender gets the puck, I have never seen a real goalie pass the puck to the dman in the corners with his hands. It might happen if the dman was standing next to the goaltender but never would you see a 10 foot pass by hand. Another example would be when you turnover possession in your defensive zone and have control of the puck with a d-man. I was stunned to see my forwards moving up ice but skating backwards. Its almost comical. Teammates seem to be lost on the ice most of the time and then the opposing team AI always seems to have there act together. Its extremely frustrating to try and set up plays as you constantly feel like your battling brutal AI. Hockey is a team sport so you rely on your team to make intelligent choices. If EA cannot fix this issue then nothing else they do is going to matter.

Some other issues I experienced was frame rate drops. The games menus are so poorly optimized and the pre-rendered graphics (ea logo) actually look choppy most of the time. This just makes in glaringly obvious this game was rushed.

In-game graphics are decent but not great. When I compare player models to something like NBA 2K, NHL just doesn't cut it. Its time EA makes players actually look like their real life counterparts not a close version. I also dont see a big improvement from last gen at all.

The one positive I have to say about this game is that EA finally updated the broadcast. It was time for some new in-game commentary and that was sorely needed. I like what they are trying to do with it but it still needs some major polish.

Overall, this game was clearly released before it was ready. Aside from the points I made earlier, the most obvious is how many game modes/features were not included that should have been.

I think its sad that no other developer has chosen to create a hockey sim since 2K decided to stop. Clearly, the lack of competition has made EA Sports extremely lazy with this title. All this means is that until some major improvements are made, I will be without a hockey sim, because this game is nothing but frustrating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who has purchased every NHL game since NHL '94, I am completely disappointed and angered by this years title.  There is absolutely no reason why game modes were gutted as much as they were.  I mean no ability to draft in BaGM, no simming until your next shift,playing in the minors, editing your goalie equipment in BAP.  There is no reason this game costs as much as it does when we're getting half a game, if that.  I know they say patches are coming, but you shouldn't have to patch a game this much to make it playable.  Truly sad.

All that being said the on-ice gameplay is a step in the right direction, it's just too bad there isn't a mode to enjoy that gameplay with. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know where to start. Most of it has been covered by previous posters. Biggest disappointment is lack of EASL. The one mode that should have been included. But i gues that mode doesnt make ea enough money from micro transactions. The game is so bare bones its laughable. The fact that critic reviews are giving this game favorable ratings is very fishy. Or maybe they arent long time customers. Graphically im just not seeing anything worthy of next gen. Gameplay is same as it ever was. The hype about the physics being done by a guy who on worked on the large hadron collider is a joke. The menus are atrocious omg. This may have all been forgiven if they delivered some fantastic gameplay or graphics but its exactly the same. Who thought it was a good idea to worry about spending development time on things as stupid as the crowd instead of add features that should have been priority. I could go on forever about the blunder that is NHL 15. First time in a long time i wont be buying hockey. They had 2 years and this is what they give their fans. What a joke 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything that was wonderful about this series has been removed. The ability to customize music, in depth GM mode, be a pro, I could go on for days. Simply put NHL game play looks fantastic but feels like even offline games suffer from lag. I don't feel like players control like natural skaters but instead like avatars on tracks. For the first time since 1998 I have bought this game and within 4 hours returned it and demanded a refund. Basically the developers at EA Sports have produced a demo and released it as a full retail game.

Thank you from a dedicated fan looking forward to next year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too many bugs in HUT mode. It's a bad game compared to the 2014.

So sad seriously ... Asking myself if it is time to play to another game.

Terrible game. Replay value is nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rightfully, I should give it a zero because I only played the EASHL and now it's not there so it has absolutely no appeal to me. I'm taking into account the 1 or 2 modes that were actually left in the game because heaven forbid they left the cash cow Ultimate Team out. I'm sure that's good. The skating feels ok, much more realistic which is the way it usually comes out of the box until enough 12yr old cheese goal scorers whine they can't score at will anymore. Good times EA. I don't really care about graphic improvements or crowd animations or commentary that I turn off a week after owning the game. I'm sure some people like that stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first NHL game for the next gen systems with a full production years advance to master and it has come through with a big fail. This game on paper sounds like a change in the franchise. New announcers, new physics, new graphics, new arenas it offers everything. But what it delivers is a waste of your money and time.
With the loss of both EASHL and a functional user player based OTP this game offers very little in the lines of multiplayer games. It is CLEAR that the only focus they had when making this game was HUT, which stands as the only game mode that feels anywhere NEAR complete. OTP was added late after release as a quick "fix" for the people who were complaining about its removal from the game. Online Versus mode is the other Online Multiplayer mode, where you choose a team and play against a random or a friend. This game mode is simple and works.
The single player modes are tossed together and incomplete. Be a pro leaves out things such as "Sim to next shift" when your on the bench, Be a GM mode just looks wrong and sloppy. Navigate any of the menus on the game and you'll get a sense of thrown together and lack of care form the makers.
Excited for new announcers? Don't be. Their new phrases are probably more annoying then the old ones were after the many years we dealt with those ones. With stuff like "HE WISHED HIM A HAPPY BIRTHDAY 4 MONTHS EARLY!" you'll be muting your announcers by the end of day 1.
Visually the game is good. The arenas, players and crowd are all stunning and crisp. It's one of the few things that there is nothing bad to say about in this game.
In all, between what they removed from the game, and the way they tossed everything else into the game with a careless mashed up effort, this game is pure garbage ad probably the WORST of the EA NHL Series. Unless you ONLY want to play HUT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All I can say is that tube graphics are good, that's it. The gameplay is horrible, tube AI just randomly turns to ridiculous mode. Tested it one day, made four 99 players including a goalie then put all my stats up and the AI all the way down. The outcome? Couldn't score one goal as Chicago and lost 7-0 to Carolina.  Been playing these games for a long time and this one is a joke.  Score of 2 for graphics that's it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a tuff review, Ive been playing nhl games since nhl 2002 including almost all of the 2k games and I have to say gameplay wise, I kind of like the direction the game is going in, BUT the glaring lack of features, and the overall rushed feeling makes this game terrible.  they took out so many features its embarassing, but when you consider that they probably have like 8 people total working on this game and that EA rushes all of their games because the don't care about their consumers or their games at all, Im happy that they made a gameplay change that didn't completely ruin the game (like FIFA), my hope is that they spent all the time they had making the gameplay and not the features, so in NHL 16 they will have both the gameplay and the features, but knowing EA theres a very good chance that wont happen.  There are some very specific issues that I can point out, player stats really don't mean anything, theres a video comparing a 96 overal sidney crosby to a like 70 something mike brown (SJ sharks enforcer) and they are basically the same in every catagory.  ALSO shortside goals are the easiest thing in the entire game, the worse the angle, the more likely it will go in.  The one thing that really pisses me off is the goalies, if you play a game against a computer you goalie just goes full retard mode, he'll try to cover a puck thats 10 feet away, or hell go out to get the puck then change his mind and let in an empty netter, OR more likely he will just let every single shot they take go in, and no it doesn't matter who you have in net, Ive used almost all of the top teir goalies and the only one thats even slightly better than the rest is Ben Bishop because he is 6'7".

So all in all this game is definitely not worth getting, even with the slight gameplay upgrade it still is just aggrivatingly terrible and lacking in feautures. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is 90 minutes long and the gameplay is so simplistic and barebones even for a VN standard. The price for this game isn't worth it. You will beat it on one setting then realize you could have spent those $6 on something more valuable. Not to mention the whole thing ends on a cliffhanger, trying to become an episodic release. There's absolutely nothing interesting about this supposed spiritual successor to Hotel Dusk. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A good example of how not to do a first person shooter on a handheld. Everything about this game is average, from the bland levels to the repetitive gameplay. It doesn't help that the controls are terrible on the PSP hardware no matter what configuration you use. Skip this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game. Downloaded it 3 years ago off of PSN and still haven't finished it since I can barely stand playing it. Bad controls, level design, boring, and repetitive. Story is nonexistent as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While i appreciate the attention to detail from the book, the game as an rpg sucks. the missions are pointless, the character design is laughable, and the camera angle are the worst ever, period. Do yourself a favor, if you MUST play this game do to some odd mental dysfunction you have, at least save yourself $50 and rent it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought it'd be fun, but I was way off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I first encountered this game I was a little bit tired of the Simms and the fact of having naked chicks and been able to manage the Playboy empire from Hef's shoes seduced me at first, then I become unsatisfied because it was more than the same. The experience as a whole is lame. Not Recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As it seems that most reviews on here are at least from prior to the (re)release on Steam, I just had to voice my opinion on the game and last but not least the team behind it.

Firstly, how a company dares to charge a premium price (a 10 year old game that's hardly been revamped at all) is beyond me. I'm simply baffled by this and it just shows that the company behind the game, Running with Scissors (or RWS), doesn't have any respect for the fans nor casual gamers who might find interest in a game that, to be honest, was bloody brilliant. However, it was brilliant 10 years ago.

Compare it to games in its price range, such as Payday: The Heist, Killing Floor, Torchlight II and Orcs Must Die 2 and it's a nobrainer where your money should go.

No, Postal 2 should be, if not abandonware, then freeware at least. They could've use microtransactions if they'd even bother ,but they just took the route of ripping people off instead.

Sad, cause it was a mental and frankly a good game. Was, as in 2003. Stay away! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Postal 2 was originally released in 2003. It is a notable pioneer in the open-world / sand box games, although controversial at the time for its graphic violence. Fast forward about 10 years til present day and you'll realize that a plethora of similar games with improved gameplay and mechanism. Examples? GTA franchise, Far Cry Franchise, Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs (my fav), and the list goes on. Although I enjoy bits of gaming nostalgia, I can't possibly justify the Steam pricetag of $14.99.

Only buy this game if you are curious what all the hype was about (ten years ago) or if it goes on sale for ridiculously cheap. Even on sale, I'd probably just save my money... There's so many new games with polished mechanics and graphics, dont waste your time on this archaic title. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Once again, EA fails to deliver a true basketball experience.  While 2K is the better option this year, 2K has its share of flaws as well. Maybe one day gamers will see a good basketball game on console. Until then though, we can all dream of 1995 when basketball games on consoles were fun and engaging. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After 15 minutes I still had no idea what a hell was I doing in this game. After 20 minutes I QUIT. In my opinion this game doesn't worth all gigabytes that was required.
Anything positive? Yes, the graphics were okay. The rest I didn't like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My main problem is the game simply isnt fun to play. Its actually very boring & feels like a real chore to play more then a few games

Terrible Lag & Frame rate which hasnt improved one bit since i first played the Beta June last year

CCP keep claiming you will experience MASSIVE EPIC BATTLES well where are they?? cos i dont class 16v16 massive scale

Still haven't seen the 24v24 they been hyping on about for the last year or so

From my experience CCP promise ALOT of things but never seem to go thru with them 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

hmmm where to start. DUST 514 a Shooter so incredibly unremarkable and mediocre its actually kind of extraodinary. Its as if the devs at ccp all went "hey! lets make the most boring and generic shooter we can and tie it into our anything BUT generic mmo!" yeah great idea tom! that being said the only thing you can really say about this game is "its a shooter"  in a more specific tone this game is absolutely rife with bugs and the core shooting mechanics are "questionable" at best and the ingame cash shop is pretty insulting (pay to win yay!!). about the only good thing about DUST is that its free, other than that this game is mediocre or worse than mediocre in pretty much every aspect. not even worth your time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shows lots of promise (pretty to look at) and has a very novel concept (grand scale), but the fun factor gets lost in over complex systems and glitches. The controls are also not easy to get the hang of, and once you do you never loose the feeling that they are awkwardly trying to teach you some new muscle memory that you don't need or want. I feel like they were trying to be innovative with them but fell flat. Not bad for free, but not good enough to merit my very valuable time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Played the Beta.... tried very hard to give it a chance, hated it. Decided to download it when it came out Tuesday for free and give it a second chance (this time playing it online with my girlfriend). We both tried very hard and gave this game a fair chance to impress..... it is junk. I guess this isn't really much of a review as much as it is just an honest score. I actually did quite well too, I had many more kills than deaths and my team won most of the matches I played. No wonder the game is FREE... you get what you pay for.. or don't pay for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A f2p game remind me of overwatch , and the steam version of it. The game is just  almost unplayable, the hud is horrible, and it is clearly a p2w game, just as almost every f2p game out there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As Much as I want to like a smaller production value game, the mechanics are too cliche. the Best way to describe the combat system is taxingly tedious. I cannot stress enough how boring and uncreative it is, it seems more like the combat was an after-thought. The story itself is based around is based around a task system that doesn't allow much for imagination or creativity. Overall its a very linear experience, do this, do that, get this, go here tasks are overwhelmingly boring. As much as I want to continue on the story, it is simply not worth my time.
I personally don't hold anything against the game engine or the graphics, the controls, or the story. Its just the rest of the game that holds me back. Its obvious more time and thought is needed in multiple aspects of this game. I applaud the developer's efforts, but this seems more like a pre-release.

At this point I would ask for a refund if Steam allowed it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Contrast was one of the first games I played on the PS4 and what a terrible way to be introduced to a new system. Im not a huge fan of puzzle games but when they are done right they can be very enjoyable. Contrast  adds a slight twist of puzzles that occur once or twice in other better games. The game play graphics and story were painfully bland and uninspired to the point of being a chore to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would give this game a 5 or 6 if it were on the PS3. There is absolutely no reason for it to be on the PS4. I enjoy the puzzles, and the platforming is fine. However, the story is just kind of there. I wanted this game to take me to narrative realms that I've never explored before. Instead, it was an excuse to check out new environments. The only good part of this game is that it's free. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics suck and its just a boring game! The only good thing is the multiplayer but not all times! A S**T game! dont buy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible grid combat with extreme difficulty settings that their eleven year old audience may not be able to play it. I couldn't bare to play it for too long. The graphics are rarely seen and when they are, they aren't bad. The sound is unmemorable and the story is just as forgettable. Don't get this for yourself or anyone. The gameplay could be pretty decent if it wasn't so hard and didn't expect so much from you so quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This games graphics blow i bought the game for ps2 and played for 1 or 2 hours and beat the whole game the sound is ****'d up it frezzez all the time and that ot only on my ps2 i tried it on my friends also and it freezez so it is the crapiest game ever.TIP: DONT BUY IT 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is not very challenging to say the very least. After being a yu-gi-oh fan of the cartoon series but having never played the card game before, it only took me a few games to begin winning every duel. I am an old MTG gamer and know strategy very well, the computer is predictable. The graphics are rather bad considering this is a PS2 game , sound is horrific and one of the more fun aspects of the game ( fusions, Rituals) are way to time consuming to learn or aquire the cards for the rituals. I beat both sides ( white and red ) in one night of like 4 hours so not nearly worth my 39.99 I paid for this game. Tip: once you aquire a few decent powerful cards, duel yourself in custom duel to spin and get duplicates of those cards. Once I had a few decent dragons and couple mountains you can really own just about anyone in the game, get a couple swordstalkers in your deck as well, they are very helpful indeed. Oh, only reason I continue to play this game is trying to level my deck leader up to get special leader skills. I have played like way over 100 games and yet to get any special abilities for him at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a huge disappointment. It is not as colorfully vibrant as I was expecting. The game story is weak and uninteresting. The mini games are fun and some have a high replay value. Creating buildings, obtaining points and winning a board is not as rewarding as it should feel. The boss fights are a positive though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game for $15, and I'm still not sure if it's worth it. Super-repetitive, clunky controls, and downright broken in spots. The initial overload of gore was fun for half an hour, but then you've gotta play a half-broken version of a game that's not that great to begin with. Avoid-- you can find much better action or adventure games in the discount bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun at first for maybe a few minutes but everything about this game is repetitive. The sound and graphics are the only positive for me and even those aspects don't break any new ground.
Graphics: 1  Story: 0  Sound: 1  Performance: 0  Gameplay: 1 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've fished so la for a long time.  This game is fairly realistic in the way the bass hit nad the way the bait work in the water.  Once the fish is on, all reality goes out the window.  You can't control your rod.  Nor the speed of tghe reel.  And I've never broken lines or not been able to set the hool like in this game.  Nor have I had very many fish get off the hook once it was hooked.  Lost 7 fish in a row to one or the other.  This game needs a lot more work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total soccer crud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea of creating a more arcade style, quicker paced spin-off of the hugely popular FIFA series was certainly a sound one, after all it worked pretty well with the NBA Street series. Unfortunately however, when it came to the execution EA got virtually everything wrong.

Even played against a friend it was difficult to garner much enjoyment from the game and I could spend all day listing the huge number of flaws that prevent it from even being considered average, just a few examples of this are listed below:
- Terrible ball physics with players seemingly having the ball stuck to the feet.
- Too much focus on being able to perform worthless tricks rather than actually playing soccer.
- The special 'Gamebreaker' shots are a waste of time.
- A terrible selection of 'rap' music and a truly obnoxious game announcer.
- Winning is far more reliant on luck than skill.
- Dull single player career mode.

I could go on but by now you should have realised that this is one to avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here's a hint: Are you an achievement whore like me? Yeah? Ok, go get this, and enjoy the single level of fighting and the new character who really offers little to the game. Are you a sensible non-ocd person who wants the most bang for your buck? Go spend your money elsewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Would probably have rated this higher if not for the fact a Prothean squad mate should not have been day one dlc, i mean, come on they're saying however many years this was in production and no one had this idea until too late in production to add this to the main game. Worth getting if you're a big mass effect fan other wise it's not really worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a huge fan of the sRPG genre, and this game is among the worst I've ever played. How do you mess up the camera in a static-view turn-based game? The AI is a joke, the characters are dull, and the story is poor at best. Even the battles - an sRPG's bread and butter - are lifeless. Avoid this junk at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor story! lack of excitement ... just like doing the same thing again and again.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A nightmare. Feels like they took the Xen platforming sections of Half Life 1 and based a whole game around them. Clunky and awkward and miserable. Not something I could bear to force myself to play for any period of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game looked interesting, and at its core could have been a really enjoyable game...but the controls are absolutely terrible. There is minor input lag, which becomes rather annoying when attempting to time runs; the interact button is unresponsive, meaning that you will often not let go or grab the object you intended to; and for reasons I cannot possibly understand, at certain points right becomes down on the left stick.

It really is a shame, as this game had the potential to be fairly entertaining. At its core, this game is a puzzler. The challenge should be in solving the puzzle, not wrestling with the controls for 10 minutes trying to input your answer. Knowing the solution and not having an adequate means of inputting it is just frustrating.

I would recommend avoiding this game, at least until the controls are fixed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a massive fan of the Pokémon Games, particularly the Mystery Dungeon games, but this one disappointed me.
The Mystery Dungeon games had become known for their fantastic stories as well as the Gameplay, but this just rehashes the dynamics of the first games with a couple of insignificant changes - hardly worthy of topping The Guild from the last set of games.

The graphic update is good, but it seems like that was all that was really on the game makers' minds. The story is predictable, your partner has very little character development, I ended up finding it a lot harder to connect with these characters as the other NPCs than I have done in previous games.

It's much easier than previous games as well - I completed the whole thing in about 2 days with very little trouble. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Easily the weakest entry in the series. The story is shallow, and rarely feels engaging. Often you are forced to follow the pace of the game, being forced into story-elements that rarely are welcome. You are no longer able to do multiple jobs per dungeon, which makes the dungeon-crawler element even more of a grind than it already is. The addition of mini-games might seem endearing, but only adds to your list of chores you have to perform, as these are neither fun or interesting. Additionally, the difficulty has been scaled down significantly and is clearly designed for a younger audience, rather than long time fans of the series or dungeon-crawlers. Giving credit where credit is due, the graphics have received an upgrade befitting the 3DS, and the colors are vivid and smooth. The game also has some much-desired features, such as being able to change leader mid-dungeon and having moves being hotkeyed for easy access. However, these features are heavily downplayed by the features that goes against the player, rather than help them. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone but first-timers to dungeon-crawlers, who neither enjoys storyline or a challenge when playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is bad and Black Box should feel bad. There is seriously nothing good to say about this game except for the fact that it has Maggie Q in it. Other then that: the graphics are horrible (considering Burnout Paradise is a year older, they definitely could have done a much better job), the cars drive like  and the catch up mechanics in this game are ridiculous. Most of the times the random filler racers are actually harder then the "boss races" which tend to be a walkover mostly. BUT the most annoying part about this game is the engine... it is just so bad I have no words for it: massive FPS drops all over the place and worst of all sometimes you just reach the end of the road and you have to wait 5 seconds for the game to load the rest of the circuit (Yes, I'm dead serious).

Terrible game, I picked this up for €6. A part of me would say, fine for some easy trophy's but please: do yourself a favor and save yourself the frustration... it's not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I downloaded this game when it was on sale without trying the demo as it was on the cheap. This game is just awful. The controls are unresponsive, weapons are awful and ineffective, the enemies have no variety, and it is a very frustrating game. While it is an interesting premise being "microbot" that kills infections in the body/blood. That is the only thing going for it. It is not a broken game just very frustrating and boring. Avoid at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am going to be as honest about this as I can be. I personally have an issue with one of the employees at Ready At Dawn Studios. Eric Cappello, who is the current associate sound designer, is a new recruit to the team. He is just an amateur and I personally don’t want his work in any of the games that Ready At Dawn is producing. His work is ruining the quality of the games that are being made by the company. In my honest opinion, he is not ready to work for the game developer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Spiderman character looks washed out. The main characters in the game look freakish. All the cars are the same model and citizens don't speak. I guess that's because they disappear into thin air at times. The combat system is ruined by the frustrating button mashing sequences. Activision stocks went down by 5% after this game was released for a reason...the game stinks. It's one of those games that tries to do too much and gets virtually nothing right. Even renting this game is a waste of money. Not worthy of the bargain bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could not play this game pass the hour mark as it is a complete waste of time. Terrible mechanics and boring gameplay. Avoid at ALL cost. Free or paid, your time is just wasted by this terrible game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game seriously sucks. It looks promising, and the idea was brilliant, but the AI is incredibly stupid. It cant even understand simple orders like "go here". I tested this by pointing a tank in the correct direction manually and telling to drive 100m down a straight road. Instead it did a left turn and rammed into a wall, backed up, and continued to run into the wall for 6 minutes, when i got bored and manually drove it to its destination. The comcept is good, but the game itself needs a LOT of work. Definately not worth $49.99. Also a little variety would be appreciated, after 5 missions you get a serious sense of deja'vu because theres only 2 or 3 different sets of objectives. This was an extremely disappointing game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Idea behind the game is great and the graphics are very good, however the playability is almost non existent. This is all down to the poor AI that seems to have come from the 80s where it was still being developed. The enemy's AI is nearly perfect but your own isn't even able to tell the difference between a road and a wall. It has a hard time hitting the enemies with certain weapons or doesn't fire at them at all. Path finding its poor, it likes to get stuck on rocks, trees, walls and even take the longest route it can find. It also struggles to can line-of-sight on the enemies it targets, especially with the mantas air units. It will just hover in one spot with a wall in the way rather than move to the other side and begin shooting. It often floats above the targeted unit, where its unable to shoot it. This isn't a problem for the enemy AI which can shoot you from across the map.

The interface for the game needs work as well. The ability to send units to different location is good, if it didn't get confused with whether its sending all of them, some of them, or not going to until you execute the command manually. You can dock all the units very easily in one press, but can not dock a single unit with out "going around the houses" to do so.

Graphics are very good though, not the best but are still good to look at. The trees, water and land are detailed well. The units all have good details to them. Difficulty of this is debatable. Some times it is so easy you and just go through it with your eyes shut. Other times it is near impossible with enemies having weapons and armour FAR in advance of your own, even when the island says its weak defence.

Story to the game is alright, nothing too hard to understand. You start as a first person shooter, which is very easy to deal with, but only plays a small part of the game. The game introduces new elements when going to each island, so learning curve is good.

My conclusion is that although the idea behind the game is fantastic the AI is so poor that you will probably stop playing after 6 hours. If they can fix this to correct the errors in path finding and attacking then i would rate this game at around the 8 or 9 mark. But until then it is nearly unplayable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well this game had potential, it could have been great but it was killed by poor path finding that will drive you mad and  voice acting that will make you cry. I don't always look for brilliant voice acting in a game but I at least expect something that is half decent. This game is barely playable because of the frustrating AI I wouldn't recommend it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A really bad game, I must say. I am struggling to find what things are good in this game.

The tutorials are there, but it's not explaining enough. To control 2 units, you need to have the 2nd unit somehow "follow" you, which they do stupidly. They will stuck in things, or fight things you should avoid. I think there's no logic also why it needs two APCs to fix something.

The only great thing in this game is only its concept. And its unit graphics. The carrier looks fantastic, the APC and the fliers looks great, but the game is not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bandai Namco fighting games are usually not good, that is a fact of life sadly. Franchises that seem like a match made in heaven for the fighting genre get games that are incredibly shallow, but very pretty looking. One Piece Burning Blood continues this trend.

There are two positives I can think of for this title: The look and the content. There is a lot here. The game gives you a lot of things to fight with, a lot of characters to use and tons of support characters to get, even if the support characters are literally just still images. Then the graphics, which look amazing. It has such a crisp and distinct look and it truly feels like oyu are playing the anime in a totally unique style.

Now, the bad? The fighting, all of it. The fighting engine in this game is simply terrible. It is clunky, finicky with responsiveness and quickly becomes insanely repetitive. The combat mostly relies on you pressing a single button, with no variation for combos and even if you discover a potential combo, chaining them INTO a combo is near impossible. You have special attacks 3 for all  characters, but their use varies greatly, from broken to nearly useless. Then you have things like guard breaking that is not worth the payoff because if you miss, you are left wide open for punishment, but guarding in itself is broken, as you can guard and take no damage at all. The balance in the game is horrible too. The AI is absolutely punishing in this game, with some fights literally lasting about 5 seconds. All it is is a frustration simulation, that has a huge amount of style but barely any substance. This is barely a fighting game, and if I consider it a fighting game, it is one of the worst ones I have EVER played.  And this is sprinkled with day 1 DLC too, which is always a bad sign. This game just isn't worth $60. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a very mediocre fps (to say the less), graphics are more like those ones from ps2 games. I think Unit 13 is much better (although it's not a fps). What really impress me here is the existence of some positive scores (maybe there are some game developers from nihilistic subscribed). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Games like this make me wonder if the developer was even really trying. I was looking forward to this game and it honestly disappointed me. The graphics are a mixed bag, ranging from atrocious to decent, with the latter hardly making an appearance. The touch controls feel tacked on and unintuitive and the enemy AI is ridiculous, with most of the Chimera just standing around waiting to be shot in the face. It would take me far too long to explain everything that is wrong with this game, but to name a few: story mode is ridiculously short and incredibly easy, graphics randomly pop in and out, the touch screen is highly unintuitive during a firefight, and cutscenes are UNSKIPPABLE (this one is just nonsensical). It's a fun game if all you're looking for is an incredibly generic FPS in which you shoot things that don't fight back (maybe the Chimera are peacefully protesting being put in such an abysmal game). If you're looking for more, look elsewhere because this installment is a vapid excuse of a game and nowhere near the caliber of the games that came before it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It the first FPS on the psvita but it not good  graphic look like the iphone  games and story it very weak it worth 10 but no high.The touch controls feel tacked on and unintuitive and the enemy AI is ridiculou 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played it through to the end and never picked it up again. The turbos just made the game too easy. No challenge at all, even on the hardest difficulty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What happened to you, FreeStyleGames? You'd better make more good games like DJ Hero series were. This game is not innovative at all, every karaoke game is outstanding compared to "that". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is 11 gigs of suck. After a run of amazing first person shooter games released lately, Midway fails to deliver a game worth playing. Orange Box, Bioshock, Call of Duty 4 have raised the bar. And Crysis eats that bar and makes a new one with games like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Been a fan of il2 since the demo been flight simming since chuck yeagars on XT comps. Purchased a i7 dual 3.3 nvida 590gtx and 12 gig of ram. Game is unplayble in med and high res even with aa and af off.  Looks nice in screen shots thats about it.  Wrote to the maker of the game claims game is made for computers that are no out yet which is a damn joke. Dont support ubisoft 1/c games after this greedy flop.  Very lacking in the ammount of content as well. Time for another to come and take the crown of wwii combat flight sims. Waiting patiently 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Filled with issues even after over a six months of updates. Almost unplayable lobby system, bugs and lack of content. Why ever did they have to "fix" things that worked in IL2:1946? I enjoyed the earlier IL2 game a lot, but this has to be one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a big Il-2 fan since .. about 2008 but this game is really bad, i cant run it on middle graphics with a gtx 260 but that's not the big deal. The Campaign is short and strange to play and you have so many bugs in the game. The complete opposite of the Normal Il-2 Sturmovik game.
So this game is just like a downgrade in every aspect. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

just buy Dead Island instead.  The "crafting" is tedious and the inventory is insanely small for a survival type game.  I would suggest the developers make the inventory something like 50-60 slots instead of the 16 you get.  It really gets old dropping items you may or may not need later.  Overall it just wasn't fun and seemed more tedious than anything.  I really wanted to like this game but sadly it didn't happen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i love my 360 and if you love yours i advise you don't feed it crap or dynasty warrior 6. the game is susposed to be a dynasty warrior revoultion but its about as revoulitionary as the french revelution. yeaah the graphics gave me an eyesore like drunks looking at flashing lights. the gameplay was like riding a crippliled pig, the presentation was like a guy with athritis making a powerpoint presentation. the game was just tutor to my soul i think after playing this i will neveer be the same 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They updated the graphics but they didnt do anything else. I believe Battlefield 1943 should have been included in the summer of arcade roster instead of this game. I cant believe i wasted 800 points on this mediocre title. Shame on Ubisoft for attempting to sell this game originally for 1200 points. Even with the graphical update you can get lost and cant tell which turtle you are when theres a bunch of characters on the screen. The first blemish on the summer of arcade 09. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is a slap in the face for any DS fan, it is just a hollow piece of crap that fails badly at pretending to be a game. I can understand that people might want games that are short, but that means you have to put some quality into them and not this sort of garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. Worst camera view in the history of computer gaming - you're basically unable to look up, ans see a bit of floor in front of you! Utterly linear gameplay. No replay value whatsoever. Lame weapon and armour system. Good for insomnia. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Average game marred by ridiculus camera oriented control system, it wants to play like an FPS so give it an FPS control system....GRRR waste of hard earned cash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ridiculously bad. Poor graphics, lacklustre level designs, laughable skill progression, complete lack of random loot system and retarded control scheme. Try shadowgrounds instead, a way superior game at a lower price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

FAIL! I don't know, what this game wants to be. It is NOT a RPG, neither it is an action game. For an RPG, it's way too shallow, bland and simple. There are RPG elements, but it really does not matter, if you upgrade your special abilities or not. You don't care for the character you're playing. You don't care to listen to mission descriptions and the story. You just right click on any adversary until he's dead and keep on crawling through uninteresting, bland halls and corridors. For an action game, the controls are HORRIBLY bad. While they work in games like Dungeon Siege, which require sometimes some strategy to win, in Space Siege combat and gameplay does not fit to this kind of control scheme. It's simply annoying! Space Siege does not even look good or interesting, so that you can show off with your new power hardware. Space Siege is a complete failure. It does not achieve anything in any part of it. The RPG part is useless, the action part suffers from bad controls and the visuals are boring, even if you have a decent machine for maximum settings. I don't know, what this game was supposed to be, but compared to the Dungeon Siege games, its just forgettable crap! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing is all I have to say. I was expecting a good new shooter as an alternative to CoD4 at the time; I didn't find it here. There was no actual campaign, just a random assortment of missions you could do whenever you felt like it. Multiplayer was decent to begin with, but lagged and lagged and lagged, to the point where it was unplayable. I would not recommend this game at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the games which is pretty much only playable while having a beer or ten with your friends, which brings us straight to the main point: you can't do it. Yep, no co-op at all, thanks EA. I've played this maybe twice. I wanted to play this with my friends maybe hundred times. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A great tech demo with loads of promise and fabulous gameplay. Unfortunately that's all that's there. You can't sim your BAP shifts. You can't draft in GM mode. No access to your AHL team in GM mode either. Online is 1v1 only, no online team play and no clubs. HUT mode is of course largely intact - so you still have the option of paying EA to play the game you already paid for. So unless all you like to do with a sports sim is play exhibition or 1v1 online this thing is a pretty tech demo. I had more game modes in my 1993 hockey sims. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I buy this game every year, and I really wanted to love this game, but EA has sold me a shell of a game. I would be bummed if this was 2004.
Gameplay and graphics are good, but just as everyone has said there are no decent game modes. Oh, and I just love having to sit on the bench between shifts with no option to sim to next shift. It would have been nice if they took a page from the 2k book and made a career mode with a little personality.
Gamefly worthy but thats it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Paying full price for a tech demo is insane. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. Ok I want to start off positive because there is some good stuff. The graphics and the new arenas and commentating are outstanding. Unfortunately it ends there. I bought this game just for HUT and so I am biased upwards in my review since I am not really affected by the content that was not included from previous years. That said I expected HUT to be fixed....and it is the same ol garbage. How do you build a game from the ground up and then just cut and paste last years software again. How is that building from the ground up. What a lie. Here is the scoop, the HUT mode is still fixed to make players feel confused about their players (Tilt is players not playing according to their expected stats) so they change them up and buy more. What is this? Yes momentum and Tilt are built into this game from the ground up. Just played the typical HUT cheesers and yes they can still get away with spamming pokechecks and doing the fairy moves all day long. Want to score a goal you can be anywhere on the ice as long as you move your stick quickly left-right-shoot its a goal. Tilt by far is the worse feature again as it ruins the legit nature of trying to make a team based on stats....throw it out the window if tilt exists the stats mean zero which is the foundation of HUT. If you build a game on stats then add tilt you break every aspect of the game that was intended and thus a score of 2 is fair....ok, on top of that menus for players and adding contracts are not intuitive and a nightmare and tedious. I was also dashboarded in one of my six online games. By my tenth game lost connection to the EA servers. Strategy menus are also terrible to toggle mid game...they are so inaccessible while game play is on...and also you would think after a game it would save the strategies you did change during the last game but no...do it again, every game start....on top of this i could not call a time out when normally id be able to. Again there is added momentum in the dying moments of periods to punish you for dramatic effect only. Again if someone owns a Datsyk your defense will part and make room all by itself. My personal favorite is trying to play the game with the score display in your face. Goal mouth scrambles you have to play through the scoreboard because it doesn't ghost out very well. No wait I change my mind. My favorite is the game disconnects you and when you log back in you find out it was so that they could update you with your daily reward. LOL sweet. Ruin my current online season every day with a randomized disconnection loss. Another favorite of mine is how I already played people with better teams than at the end of last year so the 20000 people playing are pretty much all scammers thats all that is left HUT addicts no normal people to play. Ok so my call is this game looks awesome and the players physics do seem a lot better however the rest of the implemenation negates all these improvements. The game is a huge joke and is only good for an evening to confirm how broken it is. Every untidy feature from previous years has been included-from the ground up. I really enjoy that saying because they remove stuff and put it back and call it ground up. Its comical. Well, to conclude HUT Is still fun on occasion but it is garbage without question all because of tilt and that fake exageration derived from it. One bonus though is they did manage to hinder puck farming by giving reward packs out instead. At least they got one thing correct in time for launch. Its too bad EA cannot build a game anywhere past mostly acceptable I guess having money on the brain does that....and to think I'm biased upward in my review because I never played the other modes not incuded this year 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No season mode... 1/2 of last year features missing. Sadly there are no other choices on the market for a NHL game.

Actual game play is decent, not great, or groundbreaking... but decent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh my, oh my, where to begin, where to begin. This might be a long one, but bare with me (yes let’s get naked).

First things first, I bought this game for only 10 bucks, and I still feel that I didn’t get my money’s worth. I bought this for the PlayStation 4 (so excitingly waiting NEXT GEN HOCKEY!!), but soon found out the only upside is that the base of the game is a good starting point….. that’s it. Meaning, the graphics are an improvement, the physics (while being unbelievable at times) are better, that’s it. It’s just a tech demo, with the ability to do a few things here and there (if they actually work) and change the teams. WOOHOO!!

My goodness this is the most incomplete NHL they’ve ever pushed on us. That’s pretty bad considering NHL 07 was very similar; being that it was the first NHL game on the next gen console (Xbox to Xbox 360) that was stripped down completely for next gen purposes to show off what it can look like, so I guess I understand that’s probably what’s happening here.  We now have the technology to push modes and updates to the console digitally, blah, blah, blah, is what EA keeps giving us. If you can’t give us a finished game, why release it? I know why, are ready for it?....... MONEY!!!! It’s pretty funny how one of the only modes thrown in and had time put into it is HUT, a game mode that is a micro-transaction, pay to win, money sucker. No wonder EA is voted worst company year after year in North America.

Look, I love hockey with all my heart, and I buy every years addition (the only sports game I do so for) to play with friends via online shootouts, just standard versus, and EAHSL, but none of that is there. I stopped playing primarily offline years ago. I fell in love with only creating my player, turning him into this RPG style leveling up quest, which gave it so much more replay value to me. ANYWAY here’s a list of my opinion of PRO’s to CON’s.

PRO’s:
Graphics (but that should be expected on next gen)
Solid core they can build up from (I mean there sure as heck nothing else there)
And it’s hockey I guess….

CON’s:
Hardly any games modes
Same sticks, faces, character design, equipment, goalie helmets that they’ve had for 10 years it seems. Really? Come on.
GLITCHES, my goodness, pucks wrapping around the boards for goals, players getting stuck on bench, humping the boards, getting lagged out of online matches resulting in a loss. Created a goalie Be a Pro, and couldn’t even see the pads he was wearing because it showed him as a skater…
Borderline retarded A.I. at least when they are on your team.
Online is clearly connection biased. One game I can destroy the play (I’m fairly good at the game), the next the other player is un-hittable, un-pokecheckable, A.I. plays the body and puck perfectly, passing for them is amazing and the other player skates around like Forsberg in his prime on crack.

In the end it's just an incomplete game, but hey you can see the hot-dog vender in the 140 section! WHO CARES?! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Saying that NHL15 takes a step back from NHL14 is a major understatement. Sure the presentation is definitely improved, but let's face it; every gamer is going to start skipping the intros with Emrick and Olczyk after a while. As for the gameplay, the AI being fixed is great, and the change in physics is good too (no over exaggerated puck bounces), but the modes that would've helped us enjoy that is gone. Be A Pro is an absolute joke, Be A GM doesn't actually let you be a GM; with the simmed draft (what's the point in scouting?) and the fact that players in the minors don't accumulate stats (how do we know how players are developing?). The running joke with the NHL franchise is that it's a yearly $70 roster update. Well now its worse. It's a $70 downgrade. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing to see here apart from the admittedly great graphics. Same glitchy auto goals, none of the best modes, those that survived are watered down. Disgusting state to release a game in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a huge-huge fail from EA.
This game have a great grafics and awesome gameplay,but don't have 70% of its content. I even can't play a season mode. It's feeling like i buy a pre-beta version and paid a full game price... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Personally, I don't care that EA left out so many things, with the exception of drafting in be a GM. What really pisses me off is just how poor the movement of players and pucks are. Passing is incredibly inaccurate and players look heavily intoxicated. The menu system is slow beyond any reason. It's a next-gen game, no excuse for that.

I regret buying this game. If you have NHL 14, please, stick with that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yo homie i agree wit Jake, Dis game was a Dissapointment 4 sure homie. Da only reason i kept playin was 4 Da Movie Clips..... Ya kno wat im sayin ? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cheap crappy game that is just cashing in on the movie. An amazing waste of time and money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game starts well but soon becomes very repetitive and boring. Once you have mastered your Jedi powers there is no fun left in the game as it is too easy to beat all opponents. The only plus point is two player versus mode, but again with the lack of characters to chose from this also loses it's appeal quite quickly. If you want an action game get Devil may cry 3, if you want a fun Star Wars game your best buying Lego: Star Wars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just to be clear, I'm a big fan of Telltale Games. I usually love all of their adventure games, no matter their difficulty or their overall quality. I've always found them entertaining because I've always loved adventure games,  and I still do.Jurassic Park: The Game brings a new format to Telltale, in the style of games like Heavy Rain and Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy. However, in its futile attempt to be a part of this QTE filled genre, it falls flat on its face due to a number of missing things that made Heavy Rain and Indigo Prophecy the games they were.First of all, the story is lacking. It has little to nothing to do with the original movies, and everything else seems stale and bland. There aren't any shocking plot twists or really any vibe to the story itself at all, like there were in HR or even some of Telltale's other games (ToMI, Sam and Max, BTTF, etc.). Another thing that was a huge deal breaker was gameplay and the animation to go along with it. The reason why Heavy Rain was playable as a game (which was completely filled with QTE's) was because the animation was so smooth and realistic that it didn't bother the player when you pressed buttons to do actions; they just flowed naturally. Jurassic Park however, doesn't follow suit. Animations are stiff, like all the characters are made out of wood, and actions tend to pause for a split second before and after you press (or don't press) the required button, resulting in a break in immersion. This would be fine if it was a traditional game with only a few QTE's; I've seen this kind of thing before in other games like first person shooters, third person shooter, etc. But for a game that relies entirely on QTE's, that sort of thing is just unacceptable. It feels awkward and, honestly, terrible to even keep playing past the 30 minutes. I had to force myself to play what I had.I suppose there ARE a few pros to go along with it though. The graphics are nice for a Telltale game; their games aren't the most advanced and sophisticated things out there, but Jurassic Park has some good texture work and pretty good lighting (in relation to their other games of course). The video settings allow for a lot of customization as well, like post-processing and anti-aliasing, the kind of thing I would expect from a PC game. (I realize that this is the 360 section, I figured I'll post it here anyway) The sound is also pretty good, the classic dinosaur roars and sound effects will make you think back to the old movies, which is a good sign considering what this game is supposed to be. However, the same cannot be said about the voice acting, which is uninspired, flat, unconvincing and makes it really hard for the player to honestly care about anything anyone is doing. Overall, Jurassic Park: The Game is a very, very, VERY big disappointment. I'm giving it a 2 for the 2 pros I listed above, but that's about it. I feel like Telltale made a very bad decision in releasing all these episodes at once instead of monthly. Usually with their episodic methods, they are able to fix up things that were complained about in previous episodes and make it an overall better experience. Releasing them all at once eliminated this possibility, and the results show; each episode is as boring and uninspired as the last. If you want something to bore you to tears while you Press X to Not Die, then I don't even think I could recommend you this; $30 is too much for this game. The game was gifted to me and I'm REALLY sorry for whoever did do so. This won't be a game I'll be touching ever again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe not worth zero but certainly worth 2. Very tenuous relevance to the Jurassic Park movies, cookiecutter action that aint worth pi**ing on. Save your cash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It has dinosaurs... and that's pretty much the good news. Asides from a few decent quicktime events, all there really is to this game is a boring story, even more boring "puzzles" and having tried it, I found it depressing that Telltale actually got their hands on an otherwise decent franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The risk with any tie-in is that of a misfire. When a game is introduced into an existing franchise, it runs the same risks as a film made from a game. And, like so many films made from a game, this suffers the reverse curse: the game does not live up to the film. Or the book. Or someone talking about a friend who watched the film. Truth told, "Jurassic Park: The Game" would be more accurately titled "Jurassic Park: The Minigames." Why? Because that's all this "game" is: a series of button-mashing minigames. There's no content to be had. Okay, so let's do this by the numbers. Graphics are poor, with only moderate-resolution 3D models skinned with moderate resolution textures. Environments are a little better, but not much, and mobile objects (dinos and people) look cartoonish. Settings are generally adequate and it's amusing to wander around the various locales seen in the film. Well, sort of. Another problem is that the game gives you practically no unscripted control, meaning that you're beholden to what's been written for you, no deviations allowed. Writing is some of the worst hack dialogue you're likely to hear any time soon. And the gameplay, oh the gameplay. There's no walking around, no taking your own lead. It's all a series of on-screen button and stick prompts. The whole game is one big minigame, and that's truly pathetic. (On the plus side, we've finally found a game that if it were converted into film, Uwe Boll could actually improve; it's as bad as it can get already, so even he couldn't cause any more damage.) It's no surprise that the original film cast declined to be part of this project; they were protecting their careers. Look, even in the bargain bin, this turkey is overpriced. You can get the same experience by buying yourself a Simon; push the buttons in order and it's just like playing this game. The only thing keeping this...thing...out of the zero out of ten category is the relatively faithful reproduction of props and scenes from the film. But everything else? Zero. So it's a VERY generous two out of ten for a minigame stretched to an excruciatingly-long full game. But don't buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Equally bad as Sonic '06. that's all i have to say

Broken and Slippery Controls and Broken Werehog Stages. it seems the Day Stages are the only good levels in the game. This game still has potential. but one of the worst entries hat Sega has ever put in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this game, as I've put a ton of hours into it over the last couple years.  The first hurdle you have to get over is the lack of introduction to the class system; you start out as one of the basic classes, but it doesn't even pretend to introduce the concept of the advanced classes to you.  Now, the important thing here is that I wanted to play one of the advanced classes as my main class, so I have the option of paying $15 to unlock it or playing one of the basic classes up to max level to unlock an advanced class.  I get that the devs need to make money, too, but telling me I either have to pay $15 or spend hours leveling a class, only so that I can start leveling the actual class I want to play is very poor design.

I started playing again at release and I just can't bring myself to play for more than a couple hours at a time.  On top of all of the annoyances of the class system, the quest system is back to square one as far as MMOs are concerned.  Every quest is 'go here, kill 5-10 dudes, go here and kill 5-10 dudes, go here and kill 5-10 dudes, turn quest in.'  In the age of quest systems such as GW2's, this is unacceptable.  On top of all of this, the AI is the worst AI I have ever seen in a shooter; to make up for this, the mobs hit very hard and spawn in ridiculous groups that will instagib you.

Honestly, I would recommend that everyone avoid this game like the plague.  I just feel sorry for the poor souls who gave these devs money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's obvious that Disney created this MMO to milk the last remaining dollars out of the hugely popular Pirates of the Caribbean Series.  The movies themselves are excellent, but the game...not so much.  After playing the game for about three days, all quests and skills are locked up until you buy the subscription.  Until you hand over your money Disney only let's you engage in basic ship battles.  When that's all an entire MMO is reduced to, it's time to find a new game.  Not to mention that it is extremely buggy and not well thought out.  Most quests follow the same format of kill a bunch of certain types of enemies then return to the person who gave you the quest.  This game either needs more dedication from the makers or shouldn't be a game at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

And ANOTHER cheap dwarf fortress ripoff. With a fraction of the depth, a load of bugs, and weird design choices, this is not a good game. No challenge whatsoever, and the cutesy design starts working on your nerves real quick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game feels very clunky, and voice acting is poor. The mechanics are really bothersome as it makes it for a really stale experience, and the story is mediocre at max. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An astronaut who looks like he's made of plasticine, a barren planet which is pretty lifeless so 2 points for stating the obvious in the games title. Gameplay involves alot of jumping..and jumping and also...more jumping. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As an avid Guilty Gear fan, this game was the single most disappointing thing I have ever played. Even ignoring the fact that it clearly can't play like a regular GG game due to the 4-player and multi-tiered stages, it doesn't even play well as a party brawler. Heck, Guilty Gear Advance was a much more faithful adaptation of the series than this. If you want to play GG, buy a main game from the series (e.g. not DS or Isuka). If you want a fun party brawler, buy Jump Ultimate Stars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cuando anunciaron xbox one y ps4 comence a optar por un ps4,solo dudaba por ryse y por titanfall, como titanfall saldria en xbox 360 la decision estaba tomada, compraria un ps4. Cuando pude compre tambien un xbox one y corri por mi copia de ryse... lucia bien en mi nueva consola y entonces... los subtitulos!!! hare mucho enfasis en este apartado pues los subtitulos son diminutos, casi invisibles;decidi ignorarlos y con dificultad logre entender los tutoriales y empezo la accion, luego abri el menu y de nuevo las letras pequeñas... jugaba 20 minutos y me dolian los ojos. graficamente es bueno pero los efectos de luz son muy agresivos, la lus se refleja en todo! en la armadura, en la espada, en la sangre, en el marmol y todo termina en tonos de los por todos lados que terminan cansando al ojo. La jugabilidad es una vil y mal copia de los combos de god of war, la historia no es de un galardon... y si, lo vuelvo a decir, esas letras diminutas me hartaron al grado de sacar el disco de la consola, guardarlo en su caja y venderlo para nunca volver a verlo. No lo recomiendo, no se pierden de nada si no lo juegan 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It felt like I have played this game before. Oh wait I did, except it was the complete opposite of this game. This game has good graphics (to console players), but did they just make terrible gameplay on purpose? Or does the cryengine just suck when it comes to this style of games? Just a linear, boring, from high budget-to low effort. I would rather play Cursed Crusade then this game. At least that game had a characters that I grew to love and wanted to succeed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ryse is basically a tech demo.  It looks amazing, but it plays like mud and is extremely boring.  Gameplay is buggy, broken and boring.  The story is mediocre at best.  Overall, I'd say skip it until it reaches the bargain bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

YAWN........ This is the best most beautiful looking TURD that I have ever seen. BORING. The same over and over and over and over again....... YAWN. Lazy developers giving you the moist tedious repetitive game  that has ever been produced. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2/10 because it is not worth the price tag. This game should be free to Xbox One owners, or at the very most cost $10, because you will not get anymore than 5 hours into this game without being bored. It looks fantastic, the acting is great, but it is so repetitive you lose interest within 5 hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Beautiful graphics. And that's it. This game is a QTE simulator, and that is it. Historical accuracy is tossed out the window in favor of the most basic combat system which ends with a QTE which, when completed, will play an animation of you killing the enemy. However, if you don't press the button you are supposed to, about 3-5 seconds later, it still plays the animation of you defeating the enemy. The story is the most basic vengeance plot, and it's littered with plot holes. I hope no one buys this game nowadays. You should avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ryse looks really good on the outside but what is found inside is a shallow attempt at making a hack n slash game, without that much SELF attempt at hacking or slashing. Ryse Son of QTE is too short, too repetitive, has lazy enemies and enemy design, bosses pffft what bosses, no progression,  story. Yeah not the best of starts for the XBONE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

bad game and very short i don't think that crytec should do eny game eny more and stay with their engine.i didn't see that vomming with all of the hype 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. With terrible voice acting and a boring gameplay there is no fun. You run to a certain point shoot the same enemies and hold x on a stupid box. Do not buy this dumb TV show based game. Strong guns become as weak as starter guns at certain areas while playing with friends. Bad Game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Defiance.
Externally, another generic self claimed sci fi "Epic,"
Internally, a broken, boring game.
Where to start? Crappy visuals, TERRIBLE voice acting, and it seemed like a total borderlands rip-off, but a mmo spin thrown in. The characters were anti thought provoking unoriginal piles of goat vomit, and I'm just getting more and more turned off by sic fi games as time goes on, but this just pushes me off the edge and gives me no more hope. Triton worlds, you should be ashamed of your lack of effort, nothing was seamless, I can't even think of something positive to say, other than that the expressionless, droll characters made me laugh. (Not for their comedic value, but for their stupidity  The monsters were O K though, but nice again, they didn't seem original. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for this game as new scifi IP's are few and rare so i really was hoping to be good. I ignored my gut feeling that it was going to be just another lazy mmo, i ignored my glitchy beta, and bought it anyways. Turns out i was right and wasted my money and hopefully you will learn from my mistake. After a 4 hour initial wait time to play, after horribly long install, day one patchs, and server issues galore, getting to actually play this game was almost as much of chore as actually playing it. Its just so boring and repetitive. The first week had such poor server support that playing it was near impossible for anyone with a normal schedule. i realize it is an MMO which is what everyone kept saying but still, that is no excuse, MMO's are not new they can do it so people can play the game they paid for. As well, video games have been around awhile too so they dont have to be boring glitchy lazy cash in liscense games. Sad dissappointment, save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is pretty bland the graphics are like from 2005. and where is the loot  the outfits are just skins with no properties. I mean If I play an MMO I want to feel rewarded. it's like a newb can be as good as a person who sunk 400 hours in the game I mean what the hell is the point of playing. If I'm putting alot of hours into a game i want to feel rewarded. and the quest get extremly repetitive. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awesome. Ive been waiting for a decent mmo game to come along for the xbox. And this has nailed it, i mean, its not without its issues... of course, but every mmo starts that way, it will only get better, more solid. But already its absorbing and full of depth. And the combat is great. Pvp is good, just a very promising start. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nightfire & Everything Or Nothing >>>>> Rogue Agent. This game is seriously uninspired. That's 2 series EA Los Angelos has butchered (Medal of Honor being the other one). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A pathetic attempt to port the amazing Zoo Tycoon 2 to Nintendo DS. Only a few animals, horrible graphics, and a rocky designing scheme lead to the demise, while the overall game has nothing to it. The zookeeper mode has you playing 4-8 second attempts at minigames to take care of the animals. You cannot explore the exhibits, or your zoo. DO NOT BUY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I seriously can't believe the positive public reviews here, THE GAME IS S**T! Makes me think that the games developers have posted comments so they can make the game look better than it is. It's boring to play, the combat is repeditive and feels broken and the two races are exactly the same only with different skins. It's the worst game I've played this year, DO NOT BUY IT! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game isn't that great. The levels are too easy, The cut-scenes are just completely random, and they're cheap deaths yo overcome through out the game.  If Crash has to die, at least let him die with good games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Look this is really important, DO NOT SPEND MONEY in this game, you gain literally nothing by doing so. Now on to the game itself, well they flattened the story and although the range of cards is decent enough there is NO way to earn them all by playing the game. Sorry wizards you straight failed us this time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sadly is worst Duels of Planeswalker game i've seen. Can they make even worse interface? I doubt it, if you take card with your mouse, there is no step back.  Good idea to collect cards and make you own deck, but not so easy as you think.... microtransactions, microtransactions everywhere, this is not game you bought, just a trial to try it.

Please do not spent your money and your time playing pirated version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(Disclaimer)
I played this game via library sharing on steam.  So I have not purchased the game (nor do I plan to).  Nor have I shelled out money to make the game "playable" (echos of the "cash grab" comments); The person who owns the game had unlocked all the cards and so I was able to make a deck actually worth playing.

(Poor AI)
The AI is a straight drop in replacement for the poorly designed 2014.  You can expect to: have the AI's draw exactly what they need when they need it and (seemingly) mess with your draws; So that your draws will be the worst depending on which deck you face.

So for example, if you have ~30% creature removal, against creature heavy decks you tend not to draw as much as you do against decks that are not creature heavy.

(On planeswalker difficulty)

But at the same time the AI is ridiculously easy to beat with a constructed deck.  Even given the vaunted "you have the choice to make your own deck", the game becomes tedious against the AI's once their strategy has been neutralized.

This coupled with the removal of multiplayer features (playing against clever humans rather than stupid AI's), makes this a terrible game with almost no replay value.

(Crappy card choices)
Even with all the "premium unlocks" with booster packs, the card selection is very poor.

I suspect that the card pool they've given you is a random selection of cards that you would get from actual booster packs; Mostly commons, a good amount of uncommons, few rares and only a handful of ultra rares.  A terrible idea for a computer game, since you are routinely faced against decks that do not have this weakness, they are carefully constructed and have a reasonable amount cards that make them work correctly.

(Very poor challenge curve)
Most of the AI controlled decks (even on the highest difficulty) are ridiculously easy to beat.  But then randomly sprinkled into their incoherant story based campaign are decks that are insanely difficult to defeat EXCEPT for very specific removal mechanics; The Hydra deck and the token deck for instance.  Being hit for 25 5th turn as a matter of routine is not fun.

This is so poor that it forces to player to play ONLY in one way to be able to defeat these decks.

(MTG color strengths are absent)
White is the most powerful color by far.  The other colors cannot come close to competing.  For instance, black has 1-2 cards that are creature removal, when traditionally it is the strongest color in terms of removal.

Green has no large creatures worth the name, blue has little control, red has only a handful of viable direct damage, etc.

All the strengths of the colors have been neutered of their traditional strengths.

I feel that the people who designed the color selections did it by randomly selecting cards from boosters.  There is no coherant theme or strategy involved in any of the unlocked cards.

(The deck)
If anyone's curious, here's the deck I ended up one shotting the game with (I only ever had to play one game against each AI to win):

20x Plains
3x Swamp
4x Nimbus Wings
3x Armored Ascension
1x Baneslayer Angel
1x Cobbled Wings
3x Elite Vanguard
2x Mentor of the Meek
1x Arrest
4x Deviant Glee
3x Banisher Priest
1x Planar Cleansing
4x Gods Willing
2x Hero of Iroas
3x Reprisal
3x Ajani's Pridemate
2x Child of Night

I only splashed black since the selection for white cards was so poor.  With white creature removal (the only cards worthy of the name, since no other color has anything comparable) as the backbone, then Armored Ascension to make heavy hitting flyers.  The rest is details since the computer can't deal with those two cards at all.  Fantastically useful was the Gods Willing, but this was the cherry on top of the previous two items and only served to make easy games into ridiculously easy AI stomping games.  I did have quite a bit of fun designing and testing this deck, which is why I haven't rated the game lower. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Granted, the paperback version could never be recreated in a digital format. However this game makes zero attempts to play as a card game and wants to lead you in an adventure when all you really want to do is play Magic: The Gathering. Surely, It's trying to elaborate and immerse you in the world, but it does so by holding your hand every step of the way (tightly at that). Then comes the worst part: Micro-transactions. If done in a right, quasi-ethical manner it would be all fine and dandy but it almost feels like punishment to play without them. In conclusion, this game is going to make you feel as it its nothing more than a ripoff in the end. Do not spend your money in this game, unless you want to come to the sad realization that a sector of the gaming industry is going down the toilet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The cost associated with this game is ridiculous when you have solid tcg games in Solforge and Hearthstone are truly ftp.  Magic needs to evolve with the times because right now I have no reason to buy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You start off with a sealed standard pool.... and a few game later you a playing constructed standard and modern decks... to be honset DOTP was better with set decks than sealed versus constructed. If you are new get Magic 2014. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worse version of the game till now. Yes we have free deckbuild BUT at the cost of 2 headed Dragon and a paywall of premium cards. And there´s MUCH more in the package...THE WORSE AI of all the Dotp, ugly ui and only 300 cards in the pool ¬¬ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is fun at first. But eventually the AI gets to smart and seems to always draw what it needs. I have yet to play the AI when it has a bad shuffle. Where myself, horrible shuffles. AI continuously is able to put out more creatures than you. Seems to always be able to counter whatever deck you build. On top of it having insane cards you can not beat. So making coins in it eventually becomes impossible unless you spend an insane amount of money buying cards. But still, poor shuffles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shame on you EA Sports for duping your fan base AGAIN! This game is worst than any of the last 3 Tiger games in terms of features and functionality.  I was so excited for it, and now I just wish I could get a refund.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buyer beware. I made the mistake of downloading the digital version for my Xbox One and I was completely stunned by just how much is missing from this game. I've enjoyed PGA Tour games, more or less, since I think '09. The real face tech and other character creation stuff was so much fun, as was hunting for better gear after each Tournament and leveling up your gamer with practice and medals and all that great stuff.
I can't describe how disappointing it was to know I was stuck with this abortion of product once I started to play it. Visually it's ok, except for the terrible character creation. I cannot for the life of me understand what's wrong with the putting system. I've watched my putts roll slowly right over the middle of the cup on too many occasions.
Maybe with some patches (free DLC, or forget it, I can't believe I paid EA $65 for THIS) it can mature into something worth spending time with, like what Turn 10 did with Forza Motorsport 5; but barring that I'm just going to have to admit I made an expensive mistake.

Don't make the mistake I did. Avoid this game. The critics giving this 60-80% are lying to you, and saying this game has even 1/2 the features of previous editions is far too kind.

I don't know what else to say, it's rare that I am this disappointed in even most EA products I've owned.

I guess just read QUITTERMAKER'S review, because I don't have the heart to go on.

P.S. - I also created an account here just to warn people to STAY AWAY, unless (free) patches bring the game up to a more sophisticated level. I just feel, pardon the pun, shafted. Hard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game blows.  It is nearly impossible to play in career mode and you never make the cut.  While putting, the ball will sometimes start to fall into the hole and then pop out...what kind of planet am I playing on when gravity doesn't work??   When you hit a bad shot, you are forced to watch the player you created get frustrated and slam clubs.  What does that teach us about temper while playing the sport?

I'm very disappointed with the multiplayer as well.  It basically is you playing while your opponents ball flies around.  You could be putting and your opponents approach shot land right at your feet...

The content is also very limited.  When creating a player, you can only change a few features about the person and select from a few different outfits...but you can't do that until you get better, but getting better requires you to miss the cut 50 times in a row before you get your stats up.  RIDICULOUS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't even give my career mode guy a beard! I don't mean to be harsh but this gives the golf club game a run for its money with shoddy graphics and the putting is atrocious, the animations are completely wrong and well....the game sucks balls....on the up side I'll get good value for a trade in 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Without a doubt the worst sports game I have ever played, even worse than early access games that haven't been released. I've been playing sim golf games for 20 years plus, and this is the very worst golf game ever produced by any franchise.  Save yourself the trouble, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

1. Career mode (the most gutted, lifeless feature of the game in comparison to other releases).It's like they got half way into developing it and gave up and thought we'll put that in and hope that keeps people happy.  It's totally empty/devoid of any features that make it interesting.
2. Commentary. Horrible, repetitive, utterly pointless drivel.  My wife got so annoyed with the same pointless rubbish she made me turn it down, off.  All they do is bag you or say you are the protege, champion of the world or the next Rory. How about just saying what the player basically has done.  No need for the same stupid phrases about plumbers or whatever.  Seriously how hard is it. Short sentence, nice shot, that's going to be difficult to get up and down.  It's obvious the developers have never played the game in their life.
3. Player reaction.  This is just unbelievable, they act like they've won the masters or throw their clubs or constantly look like they are going to kill people.  I've never seen a golfer behave remotely like that on tour... or even in club, social golf.  Again leading me to suggest they don't ever watch/play golf themselves.  If it was only turned on in arcade I'd understand.  But the whole game is full of it, literally every shot is a drama queen moment.
4. Caddie, general actions walking down the fairway. I'll waste hours of my life watching the same silly hand movements talking to the caddie.... why? I have no idea. Is this meant to be innovation? I hope you didn't spend more than 2 hours developer time on that.
5. Player creation. The player faces look like they've been smashed with a brick, the darker skin tones on the players are actually outright offensive.  Again another feature that got a very bare minimum. No game face or anything useful to make it possible to make a player that looks remotely normal.
6. Actual gameplay, well not much to report on that, the tempo or 3 click has no feel at all. Putting is very hit and miss, you either putt well or you hit it feet past or even sideways.  Why on earth they even have a swing, accuracy meter for a putter is a mystery. Seriously how many pros on tour put like that from 3 feet.  The shot types are half baked, you can't get good flight or feel at all when you are playing well.
7. Graphics, the only feature that gave this game any points at all, they have improved it but even so the gameplay seems to have suffered from putting pointless animated animals on the course.  I think I even saw a bear on one course!   To be honest, for the time it took to put in this new engine at the cost of other features, the producers have obviously banked the game on kiddies liking the animals.
8. Tour play, hardcore golf gamer.  There is not a single feature of anything in this game that remotely has the feel of make it a serious effort to be the tour, game that a hardcore serious golfer would want to play.
9. Courses, who on earth releases a game with so few courses, and they even wasted time putting in some pointless battlefield course or something ( no idea I wouldn't play it ). Supposed DLC will help with this... time will tell but it will either be many many months after release or pay for play.

If I could I'd return this and ask for money back and ask for billable hours playing this total rubbish.  Congrats on making the worst golf game in history.

Ok, first off Nick, you are a fool unlike the critics and you obviously have a terrible taste in games. Don't let this Nick character 'fool you', even if you are a fan of Gundam then you will regret having wasted good money on this half-arsed attempt. 5 minutes and you'll see just about everything this game has in it's batman utility belt for you. Only abot five basic battle combos aren't enough and you'll just find that the game quickly becomes so yawn endorsing that it isn't even worth debating. And why is this on PS3 and 360 when the graphics (combined with the most horrible physics engine) make such a mockery out of both machines? Just download the demo on PSN and you'll find that this game is the definition of the phrase 'Epic failure'. A wasted opertunity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has so many downfalls. Controls are not intuitive at all; Camera speed is not customisable; Conversations with the NPCs are awful; There are so many bugs.One of my main gripes with the game was that I had completed every quest to become to mage, however, because I spoke to one particular person before speaking to another, the quest dialog was glitched and would not allow me to proceed. In order to rectify this, I could either, open up a console and cheat, impossible on the 360, or to reload to a saved game which was over 5 hours of game play in difference. I'm not gonna make a new save game file for each minor order of conversation I have with a character.. . . Also, what the hell is up with jumping? Right-Thumbstick in is not a comfortable button to use to jump. The animations are awful too.The subtitles are at the top of the screen, and are quite blurry which hurts your eyes. The best thing about this game is when I stopped playing it. That darn buggy glitch caused me to have completely wasted 13 hours of my life playing this pile.My God, if you *have* to get this game, get it for the PC. At least if you mess up by speaking to the right people in the wrong order you can fix it! Although, getting it for the PC is such a mess too. It's not longer available for basically 90% of the world over STEAM. The game for PC also uses Tages, so it's limited to 3 computers. Goodness, Deepsilver. . . What are you thinking!?

park mack and the Gassy Advunters is nate a goo game I heart this game sooooon I thought were I played this mang this gram socks I hoop they narver mack anoother on e I carn;t belive this is  agame the shoe sacks and so doos the game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surprisingly beautiful... at the beginning. And that´s the only good thing, besides of working on the idea of a blind´s person perception.

Did not finish it, as the extremely slow-pace and the repetitiveness of, well, overall, everything, made it fully unenjojable. One cannot waste time to complete this. There´s no real teaching, not on the blind´s condition, nor the story.

I know it can´t be fast-paced, neither action-based, or classic adventure-like, but it could be made better. Much as the film 'Blind' was.

DO NOT BUY, DO NOT PLAY. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just a feeble attempt by MS to prove that their Kinect isn't a gimmick. (Which it is.) There is almost no variety, and the detection is lousy. Everything this game does, there is another that does it better. Honestly, you'd be far better of playing Wii Sports/Resort. The jet sling is interesting, as the sensor can see depth now. Unless you're a HUGE fan of motion gaming, skip this one. It's a waste of time, and money. The family aspect was fun for the first couple games, but the novelty wears off, really fast. I'm the only gamer in my family, but I could get everyone to play Wii Sports for hours.. This was boring after 45 minutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An awful game. Controls are never explained and the camera angle is almost always useless. Not sure how many times you can play 'run around and hit things' but for me, the answer is two. If you want a party game, skip Ape Escape P&P and wait for Monkeyball to come out on March 15th. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After playing this game I had that disappointed feeling knowing that the experience could have provided much more than it did.  The most fun that I got from this game was rapidly clicking left-mouse and mashing spacebar at the same time, forcing Rorschach to lunge and attempt to swing at the same time while making an odd grunting noise. The only way to really get your head around the controls was by sitting through menus and spending time learning what each symbol meant (when a character is almost dead, you are able to do a finisher move when a symbol corresponding to a button appears, however the symbol isn't a graphical representation of the key on your keyboard, it is a generic "punch" icon).  Overall, fighting is slow and not fluid, levels are repetitive, voice acting is lackluster at best, and the game is just not worth your money.

Gets just a bit better but it's still a horrible mistake! This game is boring with no replay value once so ever. This game is what we call lazy and boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are a fan of the Wario Ware series this will be sure to disappoint you in some way or another. It had 2-3 good mini games and the others are just forgettable, I hope that Nintendo will soon bring back some of that Wario Ware magic next year. The game is almost 2 years old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

what..the..hell..? a lame girl named DeeDee is the main character with no charisma, no emotional reactions and every other voice ingame sounds ALWAYS the same..the game is slow paced, boring and has no realism AT ALL, it's just a very lame arcade WWII flying game..do not buy it, there are MANY other titles so much better than this like IL-2 birds of prey, birds of steel, heroes over europe, blazing angels, this game is just dull..BUUUUUUUT, maybe, just maybe, some more casual gamers could actually enjoy it, it's very simple to play and the slow paced gameplay makes it easy to understand and play, something that some games don't even think about and the action becomes a HUGE clusterf@#k

If you're a casual gamer, try it, MAYBE you'll like it, if not, don't even get close to it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not a great game to begin with. The graphics are horrible and glitchy and the controls are suckish. I mean, what was Bandai thinking when they gave this game out to millions of children. I, however, have played this game and I must say it sucks. I never played it after how short the story was and how short the character roster was. All in all, this game sucks and should be thrown in a fire. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fanboys can't even defend this one. It is complete and utter **** And if anyone cares about Fable, they won't argue about that. I love seeing people try to turn this into something it's not and make excuses for it existing.

Kinect is a bad, overpriced tech demo and this game is just another example(as if Star Wars Kinect and Steel Battalion weren't enough) as to why Kinect doesn't work and how motion control based games aren't good with the current tech. Don't buy into this trash.

RIP Fable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I fired up the game after renting it ( i own kotr 1&2,and jedi knight academy, battlefront, republic commando. I have completed all these titles. Episode 3 down right sucks. I played it for about 15 minutes and said "what the hell was lucas arts thinking." The game play sucks and does not utilize the xbox enviroment. When compared to kotr ( knights of the old republic and jedi accademy this game can not compete. Basically i fealt as if I was playing a glorified version of zelda. I hate the actual movie clips in the games. I prefer animations. Glad i did not buy this game... And Lucas arts stop rushing games kotr's 2 plot was a mess. Dont buy Episode 3 unless you like wasting your time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unplayable. The unnecessary narrow field and split screen do nothing but damage, and I am furious with myself for having spent money on this when my son and I were having so much more fun with Blasterball 3 on the PC -- which we ought to have bought by now, having reinstalled the demo at least five times. And the arcade feel is absolutely gone. I used to love this game and dropped 20p at a time on it every weekend at the tennis court lounge. Again, sick to my stomach that I paid for this. Undeveloped, unsophisticated, unacceptable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First off this game seems to have video driver issues...at least on my system. Running dual Nvidia 8800GTX caused my computer to blue screen on 1920x1080 resolution. Was finally able to stabilize it by running 1280x720. This game is a very poor Splinter Cell clone. You will not find any of the great Splinter Cell features in this game. The weak story and cut scenes are the only things it has going for it and maybe the fact that it is controller enabled. Killing nazis is always fun, but there is no climbing on boxes, you can't hug walls, AI always seems to be setup in the right direction for you to sneak up and kill them removing any challenge, doors squeak, but AI is not alerted and even if you are spotted you can go back through the door and they won't follow. Extremely repetitious. I recommend avoiding this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will concentrate on the DM tools here, since for most D&D hardcore fans it is the most important feature.
What you CAN do as a DM:
- Create encounters on preset maps
- Place NPCs with dialogues
- Place loot
What you CANNOT do as DM:
- Create own maps
- Create dialogue or item based quests (except for collect x amount of y)
- Have a character make a simple stat / ability check roll
- Influence what loot the players get (all random)
- Create items
- Place enemies freely on maps (only on preset spots)
- Award XP to players
- Create a dialogue between NPCs
- Script any behaviour of enemies / NPCs, except for setting them to friendly/neutral/enemy 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible graphics, terrible game-play. It looks and plays like a beta version of a game made 15+ years ago. Booooooooo!!! Everyone who had a hand in this or ok-ed this should be fired. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately this game is notable for what it is not..it is not a D&D game. At best D&D in name only. Nothing worthy of a purchase here for D&D fans. This one is a reminder of why one should never pre-order. Wait for reviews kiddies!!

So much wrong here with this one..sigh 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible slaughter of the 5th edition rules. Voice acting isn't too bad in my opinion. But the simplified everything and complete lack of any meaningful conversation tree tools basically make it a D&D version of diablo (which could actually be awesome concept if that was the goal of a game) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Admittedly, I only played for 5 min. then scratched the top of the cd with my car keys and took it back to the video rental place. Heff can burn in SIM hell for all I care. Rent it, have sex on the couch, then take it back and demand your money back. Game over!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only good thing about this game is that U are a pimp. Hey I like Nudity better than any only guy but if U actually have to play a game to get any action what-so-ever. I am sorry that is just sad. Don't buy this game unless U are an Paper pushing Nerd.!.! I give this game a 2 OUT OF 10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

TL;DR SUMMARY: Game is easily a pass; which pains me to say as I typically love anything having to do with nautical, naval, sea, sailing, etc. (Thank God I got it in a Humble Bundle!) There's three main mechanics to the game: 1. Sail, explore, and pick up items as you find them, 2. Attack and have combat with enemy vessels, 3. Dock at ports via a menu where you get supplies/quests -- wash/rinse/repeat those three mechanics endlessly throughout the entire game on "procedurally-generated" maps. (At least you can also customize the factions/ships, as well as the map layout I guess... fourth mechanic!? LOL.)

Anywho, after perusing around on the webs a bit... seems some devs have "inspiration" (as a developer so eliquently phrased it on the Steam forums) from older shut-down titles/creations to then take said material, roll it around a bit, and rerelease it as their own... sad in a way... to have the ability and opportunity to make something unique and make the most out of the platform/foundation, and instead recycle something that's been done and shut-down numerous times before. :-|

REVIEW: Not to be mean, game has some promise and potential, but it just got so boring with only sailing all the time and ship-combat aside from some (sarcasm) rousing menu-simulator going on.

Having enjoyed the ship-combat in PotBS and AC: Black Flag, decided to give this a whirl... with a focus on just sailing and ship-battles, how could one go wrong.

Well, that's where it begins to massively unravel. Game is okay, customization and configuration at the beginning of factions, and color-schemes, etc is really neat... but when the game starts and you play for awhile, it's the classic wide as an ocean, but deep as a puddle dilemma.

It's another of many "pop up menu at the docks" sailing games with a locked isometric-view, where you're constantly staring down at your ship with no means to zoom it in whatsoever, so the view you start with is all you constantly have the entire game (an ability to pan in behind the ship and have more of a graphical 3D view would be awesome!), with nothing but constantly seeing the water and the ship, which might be okay. But then you just constantly sail, gather, quest (which quests you get at docks and they get put in your cargo-hold like inventory... for some that makes sense, but others not so much), grind, combat, etc. If this released many moons ago on say the NES, SNES, or even the Gamecube, or even early Playstation 1 or 2, might not have been so bad as a quick time-waster console-game... but this is a PC game, that only released 2 years ago in 2015.

It's almost more of a clicker kind of game... since when you come across pirates or enemies, your ship will auto-fire at it and all you really need to do is circle it and watch the battle commence. I was trying my hardest not to doze off while playing this, and I honestly wasn't tired when I originally started playing it... and even more bluntly honest, I wanted it to be much more fun than that! -_-

I'm gonna' have to shelf this again... because if all I did in this the entire time is JUST ship sailing constantly and auto-combat and grinding... I might find myself burned out on other games such as PotBS, etc... which is a shame... was hoping this would be a fun "filler" kind of game when on a cool-down from PotBS and such... oh well, I guess... considering the state of today's gaming-industry, guess I shouldn't be all that shocked. Even if it were more of a pleasure-cruise exploration, there's so much more that could be done and/or added to make it more fulfilling as such. Perhaps allow people to get off on land and piers/town and walk around with a top-down old-school pixelated character (think Dragon Warrior or original Ultima and/or Final Fantasy) that can explore around, dig for treasure, fish, etc... perhaps even build/upgrade a house and/or your faction's village.

Another thing that I found bizarre, is even though it allowed me to customize SIX factions, which I tried to make really unique and interesting, even on the largest map (33x33), it would only allow me to place FOUR factions!? What happened to the other 2 that I customized!? -_- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I understand Evoland is supposed to just be a simple homage to older games such as zelda and final fantasy but Evoland itself is an unbearably frustrating and bland experience which barely re-sparked my love for the older titles. Evoland is not enjoyable. The few times you get a sense nostalgia for your childhood games it is often quickly squashed out by Evoland's over simplicity and frustrating mechanics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game really, if you are under 21 or so and do not remember all the flaws and how terrible and annoying the game play of early 90s- late 90s rpgs could be, then give it a shot just to see how good you have it, and be thankful you dont have to play garbage like this. If you do remember those games, well, thats what it is, that annoying as hell pop-up battle crap, can only move 4 directions etc etc, everything i hated about those games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Evoland made me really excited (when I saw it on sale on Steam...$10 bucks? Ha!) because conceptually, it seems quite exciting. Being able to play through an action-RPG that changes and evolves to match the different mechanics we've seen over the years would be amazing, provided the game itself was also there to deliver.

The problem with Evoland is that it doesn't stand up alone as a game. They intended to create a series of references and then put them in order. It doesn't play like a game at any point, it makes no sense, and it doesn't try to engage you at all. Because the concept is so strong and the idea of nostalgia pulls at us all, Evoland neglected to make a challenging, entertaining, or even remotely fun game. It's these kinds of indie games that will bury a really great trend over the past few years when it comes to experimentation. If they had actually created a story and game and then simultaneously had you building the world, you might have had something here.

I've played a number of RPGs over the year where you actually had to build up the world around you. They're not much different than Evoland, except that they still brought a story and gameplay to stand alongside their gimmick. Evoland will make you smile once or twice, not because you're enjoying the game, but because you'll go "Oh yeah, monochrome games were pretty fun" or "Yeah, Diablo is a great game." You're just smiling because you were reminded there are great games out there you played before and many of them are still pretty easy to get your hands on.

There is a brief moment in Evoland where you have switch between "time," and in doing so, you change between old 16-bit gameplay back to 3-D, and it changes how you can interact with the map. This is ingenious. This is the kind of thing that the game should be doing. Puzzles based on its gimmick. Early on, when you switch from monochrome to colour or from no health to hearts, there's no reason and no bonus to your progression. It just happens. So the gimmick isn't actually doing anything to boost the game, to pull you in, or to make it fun, it's just kind of happening in the background. You go through one forest, now it's a more detailed dungeon, now it's a 3D forest, now its an "HD" final boss fight. It doesn't change the gameplay much.

As many have mentioned, the evolution pacing is terrible. For me, most of the greatest RPGs I Played are going to be from a 2D era. So when I started in monochrome, super excited to explore in this throwback world, and was almost instantly booted to colour, I was incredibly disappointed. The rush to 3D happens pretty much right away as well, meaning you play half the game as monochrome/16-bit/2D, and then you just flatline at 3D. The game also forgets there are modern RPGs that didn't have pre-rendered backgrounds, but apparently that's where evolution stops here.

So, moving past the disappointing gimmicks is combat. It's awful. Any of the Zelda-esque levels have almost no puzzles, and if you were playing Zelda for the thrilling combat...look, nobody plays Zelda for thrilling combat. You play for puzzles and level-design and awesome bosses. When you play the FF-style stuff, you deal with incredibly frequent random encounters, and for a while, it's just your one character, and the only action you have is Attack. That's it. Pile on the excitement though, because the second character you get brings the first spell in the game (Heal) and does no damage when attacking, so you're just going to hit attack and heal between your two party members. That's all. Later in the game she learns a new damage spell, but it doesn't do much either. That's all there is to it. The Diablo sections also strip you of any skills, leaving you with only attack. That's all you'll do the entire level. Careful not to break your space bar.

This game frustrates because it had so much potential, and they really only get one shot at this. Nobody had done this specific gimmick before, and now anyone trying it in the future will have Evoland's taint hanging around it. Plus it'll be a "Yeah, we saw it" feeling, so we'll never get a really interesting RPG that is both a throwback, and modern game at the same time, while still being original. Instead we got a demoreel for a game these guys could probably make if you gave them money. You're pretty much just watching the code be read and that's all.

And don't collect things. Anything. Don't. Those chests don't contain optional evolutions. All the stars doesn't do anything. All the cards doesn't do anything. The card game is fun, and would be kind of nice if you had any additional say over your deck or anything, but its basically evolved tic-tac-toe, so I guess you can pay some money to get your hands on that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game sucks, I guess, that this game would be a good first shooter for younger kids... but compared to any of the AAA titles that are out there (Gears of war, Uncharted, Call of duty) this game is complete garbage, plus the main thing, who actually has a TV that can do 3D??? They cost over 1,000$ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Please save your money. I made the mistake of buying it immediately upon the day of release, with hopes of playing with 49 others online. As it turns out, this is a half-assed product with poor gameplay, netcode, even interface. Not to mention the graphics might have looked half-way decent 2 years ago. The online games constantly crash, and the maps are garbage...there really isn't much thats worth even renting this game for. Don't make the same mistake i did. Be patient and wait for Battlefield: Modern Combat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Add the horrible port onto an already boring af game. But really what the hell did they do during this games 2+(?) year development? I can't even imagine how empty this must have been when it got delayed. Expect mass refunds from PC gamers including myself. Thankfully I checked out AJ's stream before it released on PC so I knew to refund if it didn't feel better to myself, refunded with 1.9 hours, whew.

Only thing worse than this game is its fanbase. Consisting of fanboys who shout down any criticism with "updates will improve it". Bullsh*t the amount of new content this game would need to be worth even $40 would be more than it already has. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got the PS4 version too. I wrote a review for that, as well, and I didn't mention the bad draw distance and occasional framerate drops because, well, the gameplay aspect seemed more important then. I only wish I could write about the gameplay now.

I admit I don't have a monster rig. An i5 6th gen and a GTX 960 usually runs all games on high with a few compromises, however. Not this time.

Had to change the resolution (and put up with black bars. BLACK BARS!) and lower the graphics to low. And even then, after I got out of the ship for the first time, the game realized it hadn't buggered up and crashed.

Steam refunds could not have been implemented earlier. Thank goodness for those. I just gave it a 2 because at least Hello tried to make some decent features like an FOV slider and somewhat responsive controls (though I didn't get far enough to start shooting those grinding sentinels)

I'll say again: Hello Games, I have 18 quadrillion other games I'd rather play instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Didn't deliver on multiple promises and lacks any sort of gameplay. As an artsy game it does wonders but only if you want to call it a game. If you take away the game title and call it an experience it would be much better. Game felt more like a VR experience trying to be a game, it doesn't hit any standard for gameplay 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A noble goal, but very poorly executed.
If you want a 3D craft, collect and survival game with no hand holding, play ARK Survival Evolved, if you want the procedural space exploration, play Starbound... If you want both those things crammed together in a weak, unpolished package with bad performance and no aim or goals, play No Man's Sky. This game is the ugly overpriced one trick pony of the Survival Genre.

Seriously, you can get ARK and Starbound together for less than the price of No Man's Sky, this game shouldn't cost $60. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First hour or two are amazing. Then you suddenly realize you've finished the game, nothing new to see.
gazillion planets. all the same, boring, nothing to do.
You see one planet, you saw them all. After 2-3 hours its just repetitive grind, no motivation to go further, random landscapes are just reskinned things you've already seen. Old stuff in different colors. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The concept behind the game is great; you explore the universe, uncovering all these planets and diverse life forms.  Where the game falls flat on it's face, however, is the execution.  I have put around 10 hours into this game, 16 if you count the time i played on PS4, and after that much time I have found the initial sense of excitement from finding these planets and species has faded. You eventually start recognizing similarities between all of them. This is made worse by the fact that the variation in the planets is small, with the only major change in a lot of them being a swapped pallet. That isn't to say the game isn't aesthetically pleasing, it is honestly beautiful, but the lack of variation makes it feel very repetitive very fast.

On top of this, the PC version has major issues. It runs horribly on some very capable machines.  It is not well optimized at all and is riddled with bugs that cause it to be unplayable for many.

I regret that I paid $60 for a game that is the quality of some early access beta (or alpha even). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bought this game on release. I'm a big fan of exploration/sci-fi space games. I really enjoyed the exploring part of the game. Finding minerals, crafting and naming species and places you discover. In that sense the game delivered what it promised.
The problem is this game is unplayable in it;s current state. I own a high end rig ( i7- 4790k, 16 GB RAM, GTX 980ti) so this game should run smooth as butter. Well guess what. On low-med settings I barely get 30 fps. If I get in to combat or start mining it drops to like below 20 fps. On high this game dips below 15 fps while I'm standing. I just can't get past these performance issues. Played for about 5 hours and that is it for me.
Was realy looking forward to playing No man's sky but in this state this game is not worth buying on PC. Get it on PS4 where it runs better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Universe could be so amazing, rich with activities and things to explore. What we get is a dull and repetetive item grind with planets which all look the same. Honestly the game became boring after just half an hour.

I thought this would be a full game, but it is merely an experiment which reached a dead end for $60. I would say, stay clear until price drops significantly. Watching a few streams playing it should be enough to feed your curiosity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Performance issue, poor UI and load of missing features that were promised.  This one is a real stinker.  It is a real shame as I really had high hopes for this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is misrepresented. The game is a Casual Discovery Game with elements of inventory management survival.
If you are looking for a chilled experience that isn't particularly challenging then it might be for you.
I bought it for multiplayer.... of which it has none BUT it was listed as a feature.
It's disappointing as it was the most hyped game of 2016 & the game has no flavour or depth... it's like a chilli with no spice or heat... just boiled mince meat.... I'd pair the game with a couple of bottles of cheap red so you can get drunk quickly and forget it is a bit crappy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Перед игрой:Наконец-то! Теперь я могу провести время не зря! Ща будет круто.
4 часа спустя:...Боже,как же скучно....*храп*.

Нет,серьезно,это уже не смешно.
Иногда,когда я хочу поиграть в игру,я сначала качаю пиратку. А только потом уже покупаю. Данная игра разачаровала меня.
Но дабы вы не кидались на меня,сначала скажу плюсы:
-Музыка. Да да,здесь музыка довольная приятная и релаксирующая.
-Открытый мир. Он огромный. Но делать там особо нечего. Разве что полетать.
-Графика. Ну хоть здесь не наврали-графон радует глаз.
Иииии плюсы кончились. Теперь минусы.
-Геймплей. Помните Шона Мюррея? Ага,того самого мажора,который наживается на ожиданиях фанатов. Где уникальность планет? Где умные NPC? Где "ЗРЕЛИЩНЫЕ" космечиские сражения? ГДЕ ЭТО ВСЁ? А? ГДЕ?!
Сам же ГЕЙплей ужасно скучен. Нет разнообразия,нет нормальной системы выживания,нет ничего. Это просто тупая бродилка по одинаковым планетам. И ВСЁ.
-Цена. Окей,сейчас цена данной игры 1200 руб или же 29$. Но это всё равно много! Я уже не говорю про её прошлою цену-2000р. 2000? ЗА ИНДИ?! ЭТО ЦЕНА НОРМАЛЬНОГО,Б***Ь,AAA ПРОЕКТА!!!! ЭТО же не AAA. А СРАНОЕ ИНДИ,КАРЛ!
-Открытый мир. Да,я ранее говорил о нем в плюсах. Но это одновременно и минус. АБСОЛЮТНО одинаковые планеты. Единственное,что меняется,это климат. Да и то не заметно.
-NPC. Это вообще отдельная истроия.
Ожидание:Нужно быть начеку,ибо животные могут напасть. У них свой язык при общении друг с другом.
Реалность:Это просто животные. ПРОСТО Е*****Е NPC,КОТОРОЕ ТОЛЬКО МЕШАЕТСЯ ПОД НОГАМИ.
Кому вообще это может быть интересно? Правильно,НИКОМУ.

Я могу бесконечно перечислять минусы игры,но на это шел бы не один обзор.
И всё из-за Шона Мюррея. Награда "Врун года" перечисляется ему.
---------------Итог----------------
Абсолютно сырая,недоделанная игра с скучным геймплеем. А ведь у игры был бы потенциал. Но,как обычно,все катится к чертям.

2/10.

GG,Hello Games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A concept manipulated in a mediocre way, giving a result a videogame without heart, without entity, and with a disastrous performance.
The latest updates give the video game a bit of variety and challenge, but it's still a poor product. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crippling performance issues on a system that far exceeds the minimum requirements was my very first impression of  the game.  I spent a while tweaking things and finally got it mostly working decently, barring the random 60+ seconds of slow motion that occasionally happened when it decided to load a massive chunk of textures at once.

The space flight is extremely arcadey, even beyond what I expected based on the trailers and dev talks.  There's no real depth to it at all, nor any significant reason to do so beyond gathering some resources or traveling.

Planetary exploration should be somewhat exciting, and was, for the first few planets, before I realized that every planet basically had every resource available, and the only substantial difference was visual.  Even then, the planets rapidly starting looking the same.  Outposts consist of the same few objects regardless of what alien race occupies them.

Stations are boring.

Inventory management and user interface is both tedious and awkward.

At some point, with a lot of feature patches and quality of life improvements, this game might be worth buying.  Right now it's certainly not worth the $60 price tag.  At best it's a $15 Early Access title. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Firstly, there is large amount of similar planets. I've been to four systems, an there is all the same animals with few differences, and same plants, sometimes without differences at all. More - there is different plants (according to scanner) on ONE PLANET, that looks similar with no differences at all!

So you grind, fly, grind, fly. Nothing to explore. Really.

Secondly, you play for about an hour, and then you must restart the game, because at 5 fps it's unplayable.

PS: this game not worth it's price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just a scam. I'm a survival video games player, I really like the exploration, grind resources and explore any corner of these kind of video games, But NMS doesn't push me to enjoy what I am doing, the aggressive animals are a joke not a challenge enough the same with the pirates, the same with the sentinels there is not action in the game. Then ok maybe the strong thing here is the survival face... wrooooong there is not survival mode, you are grinding resources the whole gameplay for no reason, improve weapons craft some stuff but nothing mayor. The planets are all of them the same with different colors, but essentially the same, the animals are a random mix of their parts horrible it is just embarrassing .... bufff I'm getting upset just writing this review it is a holy scam don't buy it, even if you like this type of  games like me NMS is not the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Despite being more or less a post-Minecraft version of Spore, the union of Spore and Minecraft has far more content and features than No Man's Sky does.

Even Spore by itself has much more to do in space alone, and Will Wright got laughed out of the industry for it.

Minecraft, meanwhile, actually does have multiplayer down to dedicated servers and we're going on the sixth (or so) year of free updates, while Sean Murray has already mentioned paid DLC for No Man's Sky.

Both of these games were completed at least a year before development on No Man's Sky even began. While the game has a very attractive visual style, gameplay ages quickly and dies sooner than the most banal 90s first-person shooter. To reward your efforts, the ending is an unironic next-decade version of Spore's, with a little bit more Arthur C. Clarke and a little less Douglas Adams.

This is not even getting into the massive technical problems that the launch is currently having, even on the most common hardware (hangups on 970s with modern drivers surely could have been foreseen even by an indie developer). The game deserves no more than a 2/10 and you should pay no more than 2/10 of the launch price for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very boring and pointless game. It is really sad, because i was hyped for it. I believe most gamers around the world are starved for a space exploration/survival game. A quality game... This is not it. And it is a pity, because it has potential.

What is worse is that the designer of the game said on an interview that he is changing his mind regarding paid DLC.

I am sorry, but this is totally unacceptable, and a scam. This game is nowhere near worth 60$. This game could be sold for 10$ and still make a huge profit. The investment required to make this game is really small, too few assets and low quality. Many features that were advertised before release, are still missing.

They should add the missing features with free DLCs together with an apology note for not having them on release. If they try to sell them as paid DLC, claiming that the game is expensive and they need the money for development, tell them you have already paid the price of an AAA game and you won't get scamed again like this. This is disgusting... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Repetitive, false hopes (i'm refering to ONLINE), a lot of glitches... I think there's a lot of reasons to not buy this game.

Sorry for my english :S 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me preface everything by saying that I actually bought this game on impulse before watching the trailers.
I like space, I like exploration, some of the early reviews were positive, so I bought it.
I regret that impulsive decision.

Take it from a 5 year veteran of Eve: Online this game is BORING.
Imagine Eve minus the hordes of players trying to kill you, it's more boring than that.

There is supposed to be septillions of stars and planets generated, but their algorithm is poor. This results in maybe 12 different planet types and 30 animal species. I'm being very generous with the planets, for the most part they are just different colors with a different icon showing you what is killing you today.

Now I wasn't expecting Spore like creature variety, but this is insulting. All of them look the same. There might be some slight variation between the crab like species trying to kill me, but I honestly couldn't tell.

The entire game is far too easy, in my trek from the start to the center of the galaxy my shields dropped a total of maybe 10 times, I still don't know what the death screen looks like.

The interface is utterly terrible. You have to hold to click EVERYTHING. There I cannot fathom a reason this has to be for literally EVERYTHING. The galaxy map is the single worst aspect of the UI, a rather galaring flaw for something that wants to do space exploration. The path to the center is utterly useless, as I got close to the center it literally got stuck in a dead end. It ignores your hyperdrive upgrades meaning it's course will take you through about a dozen short hops and then abruptly stop, while you can reach the end in one jump or infact go much futher. There is a total disconnect between "Distance from Center" and "Linear Distance", 500ly for the former is about 1,500ly for the latter. You are down to luck for finding any particular location, even ones you've visited before.

The game play is more or less a resource grind, you land on a planet, shoot at a rock with a mining laser, you leave the planet to go shoot at a different rock. There are NPC, they are of three races, all of which just stand or sit alone in one place. They never do anything, you can talk to them and maybe get a blue print or something, but thats it, there is no personality, not even real interaction.

There was an Atlas quest line, that brought you to 10 admittedly rather spiffy looking space stations. Actually I lied, there are 4 rather spiffy looking space stations that are repeated a couple of times in no particular order. It starts no where and ends in a non ending. This may last you a couple of hours (or however long it takes you to realize the map system is trash and just jump to the end). But it pales in comparison to reaching the Galactic Center.

Thats the final insult, what happens at the center. I'll rant in a spoilerific manner after the next paragraph. Suffice to say if we reached the center and had a planet sized MIDDLE FINGER to explore, this would still be less of a **** YOU than what we got. Because at least the Flipping Bird of God would be an object of interest and discussion.

It was after I had played for a while that I went out and watched the trailers, holy **** I wanted to play that game, too bad it's not what I bought. I'm angry I wasted money buying this, I would have been furious if my expectations were that high. This isn't a case of a fandom hyping in a vacuum, the developers were outright lying to us. Not just in the trailers, but in the words they were speaking. **** this game.

SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER

You start jumping to the center, the game silently says "nope", plays prog rock as it holds the scroll backwards button on the map screen, fade to black and dumps you at the start of a new practically identical galaxy with all you stuff broken. I think it might even have gotten the color on my ship wrong. I can't tell because my game bugged out and put me in slow mo, and I was already fighting the urge to just toss my computer out a window. So no, you don't even get to see what is so shiny at the center of the universe, you just start over again.

Seriously **** this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the definition of a false-advertisement, they made some scripted gameplay trailers, showing things that are not in the game, their lead developer went on interviews and TV shows and just promised 100 different things that he had no intention of ever putting in the game.
And then when the game was released, it had something like 20/100 of what he promised, and in a very broken state. I could create a game with a coca-cola vending machine and it would have much more depth in its trading than what the game has.

The games biggest selling point was that you could explore planets that nobody had ever before seen. Well, guess what, there are already hundreds of NPCs in the ground with outposts and trade-depots, so im not the first to step foot on the planet.
After 50 planets or so, you've pretty much seen everything the game has to offer when it comes to exploring.
Im not even gonna talk about the controls because thats a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has too many bugs. I pre purchased it for $60 because I believed I was getting a finished product. I just filled my ship with Emeril and looked for awhile to find a place to sell it. Finally found a base with...hmm two landing pads? I open the door, the procedural generation generated two bases exactly on top of each other and I cannot enter to sell my goods as the walls of one base block the doors of the other one. I can see inside a window and see two aliens where there should only be one. Really Hello Games? Really? How do I get a refund? BTW, the frame rate is ridiculous. One second it's flowing nicely and then all of a sudden herky jerky and I feel like I am walking in mud. I don't spend over $1k on a PC to play games with such terrible frame rates and bugs.

I also found a lump of aluminum procedurally generated underneath a shelter and i could not get to it.  I thought, oh I can just blow holes in the ground with my plasma grenades...nope...you can't blow up shelters, so the ground is untouchable.  I keep seeing giant columns of floating resources and buildings generated into the sides of mountains and into seas...and i can't enter through the door.

There are some interesting things that they did here but the execution is terrible.  It makes me wonder if any of the people involved in the design of this game played any video games as kids...I hope steam refunds me! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boredom!    :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is devoid of the features promised by Sean Murray in the build up to this games release. Possibly to the point of being illegal. Do not take the risk on this game as Steam are being very difficult in offering refunds.

The game is poorly executed, badly optimised, hollow with it's only redeeming feature being it's soundtrack and colour palette

Oh and major spoiler, when you get to the centre of the galaxy you are made to start again, that's it... nothing else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only any good for a little while if you go in with no expectations at all, which is difficult given the ridiculously over-egged hype that was poured all over this title by a certain someone who should have just released it on the quiet given how little there is to do.

Yes, there are so many planets you and all your friends will never see them all but you wouldn't want to as they all play within the same range of experience, the only difference between a hot planet and a radioactive one (or a toxic or frozen for that matter) is the level of shielding you have determining how long you can stay outside, while on-planet there's not much to do but trade, learn words, pick up resources have a brief skirmish and scram, there's no building to do and no wars to fight. The Fun-Police sentinels are ineffectual on land as and in space so are just a mild annoyance.

The odd space 'battle' may kick off as you jump into a new system (too many times) but it doesn't matter if they're ignored, there's no data on who's fighting or why and getting involved will net you the same amount of respect as giving 10 iron to lazy trader.

The flora and fauna are sort of interesting at first, but have no depth to them outside being passive or aggro and their freaky appearances which break suspension of disbelief in some combinations. Hop to about 16 planets and you've seen pretty much every variation of plant and most of the 'animal parts' that go to making up the non-sentient life. The sentient life consists of three races Beakface, Daft Punk and Brute who are just there to trade and teach you words, there's no sense of them inhabiting any world other than in their outposts, which, paradoxically, are on EVERY planet. There's no gas giants or any non-solid worlds, or even strange suns either. There is *some* variation in the terrain however, the occasional world will have giant cubes of land protruding from the surface or floating islands but again, that, with the minimal plant, animal and mineral variation slapped on top is literally all there is to them.

The one good thing about this game is the fabled "Take-off from one world land on another" with no cut-scenes or loading which has been a holy grail of gaming for so long it's painful to see it done so flimsily. There is nothing satisfying about space combat, it feels like plastic kids toys whipping around.

Some parts look pretty but the anti-aliasing is horrific all over.

The 'ending' (just cheat your way to the core if you must see it, you'll be.... less incensed that way) is exactly the kind of slap in the face that paying the slightest heed to hype will net you. Anyone defending it either must be being paid or is in such depths of delusion that they're a danger to their own mental health and yours.

Play this game with no expectations while listening to your favourite podcasts and you might just come away with a slightly favourable view of it, then skip to the end and realise it'd just an epic waste of time getting there honestly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** you Hello Games.
**** you Sean Murray.

I bought this with the intention of being able to play with other people.
I bought this with the intention of taking part in large space battles.

So, I launch the game, and what do I get? 15 FPS. 15. I'm running a rig that is more than capable of 60 FPS in a title like this (980 Ti, 4790k, 16GB RAM), and I get.. 15.

Okay, launch day bugs, I get it, kinks need to be worked out. So I do a little Googling, only to find out that Sean Murray is now blaming the users for not having up to date drivers, or insufficient hardware. What the actual **** Seriously?

All right, so I'll wait a week or so, see what updates get pushed out, maybe things will run a little smoother. And they do! a *little*. I get 25-30 FPS instead of 15, great.

Guess I'll try and enjoy what I can. At this point, I'm aware that I'll likely never see another player, nor participate in large scale space battles. I have flown around for 12 hours, litterally discovering the same planet, with different colors, different colored plants (note, *different colored,* not actually any different), and slightly different wildlife. At about the 12 hour mark, I came upon something interesting. An "anomaly." Sweet! Something new! Maybe this is where things pick up. Long story short, I was able to enter a black hole. Neat! I can't wait to see what's on the other side. What was on the other side? A different colored galaxy.. with different colored planets.. with different color plants and.. yup, different colored wildlife.

I'm done. Biggest waste of $60 ever.

Shame on me for pre-ordering. But shame on Hello Games for entirely misrepresenting their product. And shame on Sean Murray for blaming me, the consumer, for their faulty product/launch.

The soundtrack is pretty decent though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cuando Compre Este Juego Pensé Que Sería Un Mundo Vivo Enorme E Increíblemente Divertido De Explorar Pero Realmente No Cumplió Con Ese Cometido... No vale la pena 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

10 hours in and I'm pretty much done.  Do not get this game unless some serious patches come out with fixes and content.  Procedural generated worlds is cool, but there isn't enough variety to make it spicy.  Get **** sell ****  Repeat.  The best part of this game?  The potential for future content.  WAIT for that before considering this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing game, definately not worth the 60 Euro's.  After exploring your first few planets you find out that that's basicly all there is. If you're lucky you get all available weapon/exo/ship upgrades in the first 2 days so there's no challenge in that either.

The worst part is that, for a game that seems to be all about exploring and navigating, there are no maps. Not for the universe, not even for the planets you visit. There are no marks you can set either.

Once you visited a building or a tradepost on a planet, its almost impossible to find it back later.

The same goes for the planets you visit. Once you leave them and warp to another place, you just cant get back to them unless you manually search all nearby systems/stars for the name (assuming you wrote it down)

I mean, what were the devs thinking when they developed the game?? navigate you'r way through the universe, have highly advanced equipment and Faster-Than-Light speed, but not even something basic as a map ??

It does have potential and with some effort it could be a great game.

But then it needs at least : Mapping, navigating options and a decent multiplayer mode (like promised) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The grind of grinds. Nothing really to do. Just run around collecting things to sell and supply your ship. It's so buggy its pathetic. Not worth the money. I can see this one on the shelf at Walmart as a no-name CD for $4.99 real soon. I hope it doesn't effect my stock in online gaming. Maybe some day it might be up to par but for now, skip it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

*THERE ARE BETTER SPACE EXPLORATION GAMES OUT THERE*

Too many people have never experienced a similar genre of game and think this is a unique, ground breaking game. It's not. It's a poorly executed, awfully optimised and stupidly repetitive and empty shell of a game.

For £40 (or $60 if you're in the US) this game is an absolute joke. It deserves a £10/£15 price tag like the rest of the unfinished indie games out there on Steam (Rust/7 Days to Die etc). An absolute shambles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After more than 24 hours of gameplay I have to revert my first impression of this game. At first it looked relaxing and exciting to explore strange new worlds but after long hours grinding for upgrades you're thinking I'm doing the same stuff over and over again. After countless planets eventually you'll start to see a pattern and seeing the same points of interest over and over again.

If the grinding for upgrades made any sense (have an exciting experience at the center of the galaxy) than this game would be a bit better. But the only thing happening at the center is that you're getting molyneuxed and have to start a new game +.

Not to speak of the stuff that has been cut out of the game, false marketing (video on store page does not correspond with the actual gameplay by a long shot), and 'promises' told by the lead developer of this game which never made it into the actual game.

At the moment there is a deafening silence when questions from players are being asked about the above situation.

Not acceptable imo but I can understand they can't say too much because of the agreement with Sony.

Imo as a indie developer you should not sell your 'soul' for money.

Not worth the 60 euro's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An infinite, procedurally generated universe with almost nothing to do isn't a milestone achievement for game development. Spore did it, Starbound did it better. Being so disappointed in the game made me look back and wonder what it was that actually made me want the game in the first place and I honestly can't even remember. I've played the game for about six hours and have absolutely no desire to ever load it up again. I know I haven't seen everything because that's obviously impossible, but I feel like I've seen enough to where there is nothing left to see that could be important.

The interactions with alien "characters" are garbage. The fauna on the planets have little to no AI. Combat is a joke. I don't even know why your starship has weapons because I have yet to see an enemy ship.

Too bad it's too late to get a refund. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could have been a nice little 20 euros indie game. But it's an overrated 60 euros game, poorly optimized, boring and filled with its developpers' lies, as you can see in videos like this excellent one : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8P2CZg3sJQ

TLDR : don't buy. Mostly since it barely runs on any configuration. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So. I have to say. This was a big let down. I ignored the reviews, gave the game a few days, and did my best to not have the overall experience ruined by other people. This however, did not help. A short list of the biggest issues.

-To much promised, very little given. The creators promised so much and we get bits and pieces here and there. But overall they took a page from Peter Molyneux and gave us what can only be seen as a lite version of the original promised game.

-Repetitive is the name of the game. Everything about this game reeks of repetition. There is supposed to be literally billions upon billions of planets. Until you visit 20-30 of them. Then you see patterns emerge in how this spawn/are generated. On top of that, you do the same things over, and over, and over again. I'd honestly score the game higher if they officially changed the name to Repetition Sim 2016.

-Are we alone in the universe? The answer currently is yes. Because out of all of the broken promises this is the biggest. You cannot interact with people as they don't technically exist in your game. Even if they are on your planet, you can't see or find them essentially making this an offline experience.

-Multiverse theory. This is more of a pun and a poke. 10s of billions of planets and I have visited 34 as of this review. Despite my woes and over all meh feeling, once the patterns emerged, I tried my best to find a planet truly unique. And as far as I can tell. It doesn't exist. Technically, out of the amount of planets there has to be one or two of them. But after no lifing the game for days on end. Hell if I can find it.

Overall. The game isn't terrible it just doesn't feel like it's the game I paid for. Similarly to how people can exist on your planet but you can't do anything with them. This game exists and I can't do hardly anything that was promised to me over the last couple of years. It doesn't feel like it's actually finished. This feels like a mid way Alpha version. The basics exist and that's about it. On top of that, the creator decided to flipflop in a matter of a week from saying "No dlc, you paid for the game. The content should be free." to saying "Future content will probably cost something." If it were in my power, I'd get a refund and have zero regrets about it at this point. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No mans sky is a repetitive and boring game. The most disappointing game of the year, period. No multiplayer, no survival, no building, no quests. Just visiting PLANET AFTER PLANET to gather resources in order to VISIT other planets.... and you do this OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN..... it doesnt get more retarded than that. The developers of this **** aswell as the retards who defend this game, are whats wrong with gaming industry today. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lied to, lied to, lied to. There are literally hundreds of quotes from game devs and that smug lying swine who fed it to us. Do not grace this game with your patronage. Do not purchase it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It would have been a nice diversion if sold as such. Now it's a nice diversion that comes with profound disappointment, resentment, and bitterness. A game that makes the industry a worse place.

They lied through their teeth for years, collected a ton of cash, then basically skipped town. This is illegal. False advertising is illegal. But we keep forking over the cash and the bar gets set a little lower.

This is not only the last pre-order I'll ever buy, it's probably one of the last video games I'll buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Luego de que ayer el creador y estafador Sean Murray se contradijera en mil entrevista sobre el DLC del juego me di cuenta de lo tenaz que esta este juego en cuanto a lo lleno de mentiras que nos vendieron. Todo lo que dijo sobre el juego antes de que saliera ni la mitad de ese contenido esta. ¿dónde están los dinosaurios aliens gigantes?  ¿Dónde está que habían diferentes tipos de naves con propósitos diferentes? ¿Multiplayer? entre mil otras cosas. Y ahora llega y dice que cobrara por el dlc de todo el contenido que falto ¿luego de pagar 60 dólares  no da todo lo que promete y además cobra para obtener por dlc todo lo que prometió en un principio?. QUE ESTAFA. NO COMPREN ESTA MAQUINA DE HACER DINERO SIN CONTENIDO PROMETIDO. Antes estaba dispuesto a darle positivo porque sentía que el juego iría mejorando pero cobrar más dinero por ya un juego caro e incompleto es una ESTAFA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No Man's Sky is obviously an art student's final project gone horribly awry. This, this THING--this monstrosity, is a crime against humanity.

To briefly state the one positive, It is a nice looking game, even if it's so laggy that you can barely access the menu or orient your character at all. That's why it gets a 2 rather than a 1 or 0.

Firstly, there's the foolishness that's by design. You walk so slowly, and the sprint controls don't seem to work as far as I can tell. The loading screen forces you to sit through a 5ish minute starry background screensaver, as if it weren't even a game and is in fact a throwback to Windows 98, -each and every time- you start up the cursed thing, even when I already saved the game. Mining gets tedious and repetitive after about 2 minutes.

Secondly, there are plenty of issues that seem to be unintended consequences of the slipshod gaming engine design. The latest patch (as of GOG 2.3.0.5)  does little to address any of its performance issues. It drags so slowly through lag-ridden menus that you barely have the ability to figure out how to craft, much less make something of use in the barren sands of some unpronounceable planet that, to try and say, would sound like it was named by a deranged Swedish Mad Libber. I have a fairly capable desktop with i7 core, 8 GB of RAM, and no problem running most contemporary video games on high or medium graphics settings. This game would not respond when I turned everything to the -minimum- settings, and even after I did, there seemed to be very little of use to do besides.

Whoever is giving this travesty a positive or mixed score just simply isn't telling the truth. That anyone could think to charge someone $60 for this experiment is simply obscene. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game has an undeniable draw to it, I keep having the itch to go back to it, in the hope that there'll be something interesting to discover yet. Unfortunately, it is by now abundantly clear that this promise of getting to discover and explore a universe of planets will not be fulfilled. The algorithm that generates this universe simply failed at doing the one thing it was supposed to - a unimaginably large world was created, but one filled with nothing but complete boredom. Everything feels the same, and after having seen a lot of them I now feel confident in saying that no planet is worth exploring. Same animal- and plantlife, the same landscapes everywhere; the slight variations in color and form don't do anything to make a meaningful difference. If this core aspect would have delivered, that would have been enough for me, but alas, it did not.
Unfortunately, the core promise is not the only thing the game failed at delivering. Countless technical and design issues plague it at every corner, the movement is only bearable because of a bug, graphics are mostly ugly, the FoV is unplayably narrow unless you fix it outside of the game, gunplay is bad, spaceflight controls are *horrible*, inventory management is a hassle at best, crafting and gathering tedious.

So in the end what is one left with? Ambition, perhaps. But what does that actually count for when it never amounts to anything...? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointed. That single word sums up this gaming experience.

Anyone who was an early follower of this game will know how shallow this released game is compared to the game it was meant to be. The last title that did this so bad was X-Rebirth.

Lets look at what we were lead to believe the game would have:- Lies all of them.
No loading screens... warp scenes are very long loading times
Realistic physics... blow a hole in rock formation and its left hanging in the air isn't realistic physics
Multi-player... um... did I miss it somewhere?

What it looks like, is the dev team bit off more than they can chew. Seems they decided it would take too much to do this game as it was original portrayed, so they released a tech demo with a few bolted on game play elements.

Hell, this is so un-optimised it plays poorly on a 980Ti, and the longer you play, the worse the game FPS becomes. You have to restart every few hours else it becomes unplayable.

My advice is wait till its in a humble bundle or less than $10 on steam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't car about the PC launch issues since they can be fixed over time, but instated, I lost interested after four hours in. Realizing, you do the same thing over and over in boring cookie cutter planet creator/resource extractor. It was way over hyped,  Not worth $60 at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Glitchy bug ridden mess. It gets repetitive and old really fast, after you travelled through a few planets, everything starts to look exactly the same, creatures repeat, flora is similar and all you do is mine, mine and mine. It's absolutely ridiculous, there is nothing to this game.
No story, no endgame, nothing.

I'm glad i only borrowed this from a friend just to try it, i feel like i dodged a bullet by not pre-ordering this gigantic blunder of the year.
To anyone reading this, save your cash and spend it somewhere else.

Personally, i'll be keeping tabs in Star Citizen throughout its development, hopefully it'll turn much better than this. In fact, it already is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Игра пустышка.
По честному, это пре альфа демки процедурной генерации.
Ей еще лет 10 и может быть, она будет хоть немного похожа на игру. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun for the first 2-5 hours, then you realize that the game only has to offer an endless loop of collecting the same materials or going to the same buildings over and over again just to upgrade your inventory slots by 1 slot at a time.

Game had/has a lot of potential to be something amazing but it's just a skeleton worth $60 instead of $15. Seriously don't buy this game until they release updates, (and i doubt it will save this game) it is not worth it.

P.S. Game also runs awful on the majority of people pc's on launch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything in this game is of poor quality. Textures, models, animations, procedure generation, interface, notifications, exploration, ship controls, gun play, secret at the center of the universe and whatever else in the game i forgot to add. Except music maybe. Technically, yes, whatever developers promised with their vague statements — they delivered, but all of it is of incredibly poor quality. Definetly doesn't worth it's price. Definetly isn't a complete game, but tech demo at best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very shallow.  Infinite unique planets, but they all feel the same.  Fauna generation and AI are laughable.  Audio is jarring and repetitive.  Feels unfinished.  Interface needs a lot of work.  It isn't the game that was advertised before launch.  Plays like a $20 game early access game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unlike many people, the game actually runs decent enough on my PC and i didn't encounter any serious technological problems. Maybe i'm just lucky, since now i can review the game itself.

First, all the people who rave about the supposed amazing technological aspect of creating a huge universe filled with planets. 16 years ago, a single italian programmer released a game that did just that, a procedurally generated universe with billions of planets. Unlike this shallow garbage however, that game had a huge variety of planets, there were barren worlds, water worlds, gas giants, and so on. So to say that NMS did something that wasn't there before is simply not true.

At the end of the day, all NMS does is put together a planet from the same Seed over and over again and swap the colors. If you have been to one planet, you have seen them all. Same type of plants, little variety in alien life and a little different enviroments. It all feels the same. Also, since every single star system i went through has a space station in it and every single planet has those sentinel things on it, you never get that immersion of being an explorer because somebody (NPC-wise) has been there before.

I do understand that they had to add a number of game mechanics to go with the (failed and utterly shallow) exploration aspect but the resource gathering and crafting is just a huge grind. There is no fun in running around and trying to find that single resource you are missing or docking with a space station just to discover that they don't have that one thing you need.

The supposed story, if you even could call it that, is equally shallow, boring and doesnt make much sense. Space combat feels random and sluggish, the ship doesnt move nicely and you can tell after 10 seconds that its just a bad port from the PS4, with all the controls more or less geared towards as controller.

So, in conclusion, NMS fails in all aspects. Its technology is not that great and has been done before. Controls are bad, story nonexistent. And the exploration part is just too shallow to ever give you the urge to continue because there isn't anything new or wonderous to see. And all that for a whooping 59,99€? Save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a huge Ratchet And Clank fan, and for my opinion, this game is GARBAGE!!! it tries to be a stealth game, but failes at any level! the enemies AI is punishingly cruel, and almost impossible to sneak behind them, without getting spotted. the weapons doesn't even help you, and only makes the game harder. there's two other parts of the game where you play as Ratchet or Qwark, but they suck too.

DON'T BUT THIS GAME!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is very clunky, and feels very unpolished. It is really hard to get motivated to play this, and I would stay away unless you are really into this kinda game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This one was the thing I ever played in PS2 history. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Possibly one of the most boring games of 2013 this game becomes extremely repetitive and the way zombies re spawn is just one of the many many small things that make this a game to avoid.
With one of the most dullest storylines in recent memory clunky weapons, glitchy multiplayer annoying sound effects, almost no vehicles to drive my recommendation is to skip this one 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the first game .Played almost 500 hours. I love the game play and graphics, but this games crashes for no reason. If I am running to a location or driving fast it will crash. If I enter a room fast it will crash. Do not buy this game until they fix it. It is seriously broken. I have a good gaming computer. I am Playing Star Trek the game 2013 ,Bioshock Infinity and Borderlands 2 they run fine.

Generic story and short, copy of first game, pathetic animations, poor design, excessive price.

Maybe use it 30 min to kill some zombies, but that's all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the original DI. It was an innovative approach to the zombie genre which played a bit like Far Cry. This is not that. To start, Dead Island Riptide is full of bugs. Some are so bad they'll cause the game to crash. Another gripe is this entry plays more like a DLC than an actual sequel. As a fan of the original, I still say AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Insanity, buying the same game twice, and expecting a different result.

Still broken and buggy despite being a minor expansion pack to a 2 year old game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's nothing I hate more than a goddamn cash-grab, so I found myself disappointed I'd been lied to again by Deep Silver. To Deep Silver, changing a game is literally just re-hashing the already-fulfilled story, adding one character, adding a few more weapons, some drivable boats, and fixing NONE of the problems of the original. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is like the first one but I liked the first one this one doesn't work and its newer, me and my friend got this game for $70 to continue the story and we can't even join each others game I am disappointed with this company and don't think I will purchase another broken game from them again 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst superhero game this year next to Marvel Nemesis. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Each and every deadpool fan should demand their money back. This is Duke Nukem Forever of the Deadpool universe. It's rarely funny, looks God awful in every way, has some of the most boring levels and comabat I've ever seen, and is one of the most disgusting games ever. It's somehow even worse than Aliens Colonial Marines. Not even worth picking up from the $10 bin which it will most certainly be within this very year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While they fixed most of the issues with the old game, there is nothing creative about this chapter. I am still struggling with whoever came up with the idea that making stormtroopers act like ragdolls and thinking this makes for a fun game or does anything for the universe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This games predecessor was an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. Yes it was forced storyline that felt shoe-horned in to the Star Wars canon but the interesting characters and rock solid gameplay were enough for you accept the plot discrepancies. However this time around it just doesn't work.
If the story was far fetched before, now it's just downright ludicrous. At the end of the previous game the protagonist (Starkiller) is Vaders secret apprentice who turns against him and moral grounds. So Vader clones him with the same memories and moral fiber and he suprisingly turns on Vader again. Not a solid plan.
Oh and Starkiller himself is now void of ay personality. In the previous game he was caught in a moral dilemma between good and evil and we really got a sense that he was struggling with his internal conflict. Now he has one thing on his mind: finding Juno. You guys remember Juno right? The pilot from the first game that he had a collective 8 minutes of interaction with? Well she snogged him once and now he's stomach turningly love sick and as a result couldn't give a **** about anything else including the rebellion that he started.
Gameplay wise it's exactly the same as the first game. Yes he has two lightsabers now but this is a purely aesthetic difference that has no impact on how you control the character. There's also no where near as much variation in the enemies as there was last time. You keep running into the same enemies over and over just a different colour.
Also the ending makes **** all sense. Like, jack **** The worst part of that is that they leave it open for a sequel.
If you've played the first game then pretend this doesn't exist. If you haven't played the first game, play it and then pretend this doesn't exist. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was expecting so much more from this game. The story is weak, the gameplay seemed simplified for no reason and it was way too short for a £40 game. It felt more like an add on to a franchise that, I felt, could have built some real momentum but the chance was wasted. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Joyless and Boring. That about sums this game up. I really wanted to like it, as I am a Star Wars Fan and a fan of RPGs. But I can find little to like about this game.

There is no exploring or room for creativity. You just go from one forced scene to another; it plays like a cheap sidescroller from the 1990's. It is ridiculously difficult and tedious; I am a veteran XBOX 360 player and it has taken me a ridiculous number of tries to make significant progress on "normal" difficulty level. That could be okay, if the game actually challenged me to be creative or something. But no, it is just button mashing.

Skip this one, there is no reason to buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bon, donc c'est la suite... avec le même "héros" qui a le charisme d'une poignée de porte sauf qu'il est encore plus énervé qu'avant. Il balance des éclairs, des caisses à la tronche des gens et agite ses épées rouge pimpon ou bleu neuneu comme un parkinsonien en manque de je ne sais pas trop quoi : franchement il a pas l'air bien ce garçon.

Et donc... attention là je vous arrête ! c'est plus beau que le premier "Star Wars : Le Pouvoir de la Force" (ce titre à la con, il fallait l'inventer) si, si, je vous jure. Même les menus sont devenus potables, dingue ça. Je demande cependant un peu de compassion pour la manette 360 (une excellente manette, fidèle) qui n'a jamais mérité d'être agressée par un jeu pareil. Donnez la galette laser au chien pour qu'il se fasse les dents. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dislike this game. Very intresting idea, but really bad implementation. Boxy washed-out graphics, awkward controls (you have to press two buttons simultaneously to pick up an object, talk, open door, etc.), main characted can't step over 1-foot high barrier or drop from 2-foot platform except for specially indicated places, zombies respawn in empty room just behind his back, animation is clunky, battles are unrealistic and unfair, making you basically swim through a pool of zombies coming from nowhere until your health is depleted. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this game somehow managed to throw out the window everything that made the original good in the first place.
bad graphics, reused Resident Evil 4 mechanics, very clunky controls... don't buy this.
if you're gonna buy Dead Rising, make sure it's the Xbox360 version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

HUGE disappointment, I was a massive fan of the original games in  the 90's but this is terrible, no single player mode to speak of and runs at a pathetic 30 fps even on PS4 Pro, no excuse for this at all when games like Wipeout Omega and project Cars manages 60 fps. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where to even begin, Micro Machines World Series (MMWS) is so far removed from what made the franchise so great to begin with its an insult to even call it Micro Machines, I've seen a few people say its like Overwatch with miniature cars and I hate to say this but I have to agree with them.

If you are considering this game for a nostalgia hit I suggest just buy a Sega Megadrive on ebay or something, MMWS is barely anything more than an overpriced commercial for Nerf products.

The old original classic Micro Machines 2 (Turbo Tournament) is by far widely regarded as the best  Micro Machines game ever made and there are numerous reasons for that.

Weapons did not exist in the original games as far as I recall so they should not be in this game but they are and they CANNOT BE TURNED OFF, You no longer race against the same cars in different colours instead you get a meager selection of just 12 vehicles to choose from (Granted some of them look different but they are skins that you get from loot boxes (Something else the original games did not have)

I could go on and keep emphasizing just how far removed MMWS is from the core gameplay character of the classic games but I think I have laid out enough reasons to not buy this game already, If you need any more reasons I would suggest watching gameplay from older Micro Machines games and also gameplay of MMWS and see how much useless stuff they have added that rather than improving the formula actually ruins the franchise.

Final thoughts: Too Expensive, Extremely lacking in content, Overbearing product placement, Not a true Micro Machines game at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total crap! went to the tutorial, didnt learn a thing, figured out how to pass and pick up the ball in a ruck and havent lost a single game since. Unrealistic, crap jerky graphics, embarassing ball gravity. EA should pay us to play this game. Awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm really gutted. The gameplay is dreadful, the graphics rubbish and the AI is retarded. Menus, options and in games stats are good, which gets my 2 points. Stick with 2001 - this beats this sad affair hands down ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lazy coding and a poor effort all round by EA. I hope Codemasters or H.E.S (the new rugby league game) develop a rugby game in the future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rugby 2001 was 10 times better than this sh.t... can't believe that it's too slowly and has lot of bugs... continue waiting for next RWC game.. 2007...and pray for a realy cool game.. this new one is pathetic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a techdemo, nothing more. I won't touch history and credibility, this is a fantasy game, like the Gladiator movie, it has nothing to do with reality - and that would have been the slightest of errors.
It came out since a week ago and we have 2 updates for it, but it is still buggy a hell. Sometimes it just loses controll - Marius stands there, he can't figh/roll just go around and take blows... If it is a techdemo, buggy as it is, it's not a miracle that nobody buys the bl..dy engine and Crytek goes bankrupt.
Controls are non-existent: sometimes you have to hit the key 2-3 times, so mr. Marius moves/jumps/fights. Ridiculous. By the time he moves, he got hit 2 times from any boss. Did Crytek care about making this playable? We are in 2014.
BTW you can't skip movie sequences, you have to replay 5-10 mins from the last checkpoint, so you don't even want to discover or look around (what kind of techdemo is this?), because you might die. You just focus on going ahead.
Your "soldiers" just stand there watching, while you fight. They don't free the prisoners or help, just shout. Believable :)
Every boss can be killed in one way only and the game tells you how to do it. So you walk in a tube the whole game, then you kill even the boss with one trick (and these boss fights are damn boring, a chore - any of the devs played Arkham city? No? They should have...). So much about creativity. As I've told you: an empty tech demo.
No way you can take serious a "game" like this, so I gave it a 2, seriously... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not a real game; it’s just a movie with quick time events because the game does everything for you. There is no skill needed at all, just do the fighting with quick time event button presses and repeat this until boss fight starts with quick time events. Repeat the same thing for 6 or 7 hours and you are done. There is no great storytelling or anything, it seems like the graphics were the only thing developers were trying to get right and they did. Everything else is just a big fail.

For RPGers who enjoy adventuring (rather than puzzles and combat). Attractive scenery. The packaging's statement, "vast, open game world" is a marketing fantasy: the game is shortish and linear and has no replay value. It's the kind of game you resort to when Oblivion, Two Worlds, and The Witcher need a rest. The PC version is a poor console port, and bugs are of all flavors. Installation takes 15 minutes, and because it keeps seeing its own files as being "in use", you have to sit, repeatedly clicking the "Retry" in a pop-up error window. The controls need adjustment to make it playable. I often turned the sound off. Partly on account of the five second sound loops: the usual lame water crashing, wind blowing, mill grinding, etc. But it was especially on account of the lead's 20-something voice actor who was inconsistent and impatient when she wasn't so distant it seemed as if she was about to fall asleep with boredom. In some cut scenes, the sound completely vanishes, anyhow. Add to this .. the same usual lousy feeble trick of incompetent game designers: The fighting technique you've been using all along suddenly "doesn't work" for no reason. Worth playing? For adventure gamers who have played everything else, maybe. Maybe not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nice graphics but the game is not very fun at all. Who wants to get carpal tunnel trying to latch a silly scythe into a hanging fish hook to move to the next level? If I could return the game I would.

I had to create a profile so I could review this game amidst the obvious rating bombing this game is getting for positive reviews it doesnt deserve.

The game suffers from FAR too much micromangagement, bad user interface to make it happen, bad pacing, and the problem of attempting a realistic space sim but losing playability in the process.

I have played all the classics, I am the target audience, and I found this game terrible.  For reference I have completed games of Space empires, and that is about as hardcore as it gets for 4x games.  One of the biggest problems of this game is the scale, and the scroll speed, the fact you constantly have to bounce between system and 'galaxy' view but at a slow rate.  To explain, consider a game like master of orion, it took place in a galaxy view, you saw all your stars, and it was clear, you could click on a star and it went INSTANTLY to system view, you saw planets, and could click on it.  This game is nightmarish, it it almost a literal size ration of a system to a small section of a galaxy, meaning you have to zoom out...zoom out...oh theres one planet...zoom out...30 seconds later you FINALLY can see the stars.  It is literally this bad.

I understand the game was going for this cool thing where your ships are flying around the system from different sides, dropping in from warp...but it is just so hard to control meaningfully.  Systems are HUGE and ships are nearly life size...meaning invisible.  No big icons at all.  Multiple times I clicked on the ships icon and could not find my ship despite being in the middle of the screen.  The stars that are part of the background are not obviously different from system stars, so it was annoying trying to find actual systems.

So beyond the massive scaling problem (and terrible scroll speed) the pacing is bad.  It is real time, but basically the only way to really play is a 'turn based' style of pausing, issuing orders, playing at 4x speed until new orders...pause...repeat.  What I hate is how slow your ships move in a system, again it was as if he was going for a realistic sim, at the heavy cost of gameplay.

The user interface for ships and colonies is terrible.  You can have a list of colonies (good) but not actually click on them to go to them (very bad) I mean how obvious of a feature was this to include?  Every space game I've played from the 90s on let you click from a list to actually GO TO the planet.

Last...ship design.  It is not good.  You have a whole bunch of squares, and you throw stuff in it (imagine space empires if you played it) but the problem is you have a LOT of stuff to throw in, and very little difference.  You have a gun that does 15 damage and cost 500 or a gun that does 14 damage and cost 460 and does the exact same effect, woah such depth.  You have the annoyance of placing power plants and then connecting wiring to all your stuff.  If I wanted to be WIRING my ships I would have gone into engineering.  There is no auto complete, and whats worse is there are certain areas that you cant place stuff in.  Ship design in normally fun, or at least not a chore, it is very very annoying in this game.  There is not a good info screen or anything either to decide if your ship is even good or has good stats.

In closing there are some things that need improving like scroll speed, but that is a little thing that could get patched, but real things like the far too complex ship design, VERY bad pacing, very bad scaling of ships to systems to stars, and generally not fun because it isnt clear what is even happening makes this a game not recommendable, and this is from someone thats played a lot of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been playing this game since it was in beta and it is STILL in beta.  Some aspects are a lot of fun.  Designing your ship is cool and the combat can be interesting to watch.  Despite that, the game is absolutely not complete.  If you venture over to the forums you will see the devs asking people to review this game on Metacritic.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing in of itself, but there is a reason this has so many reviews and so many of them are positive.  There is an active and engaged community on the forums.

Seriously do not buy this game yet.  It has tons of potential, but right now it is an absolute waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really, I just couldn't stand the game.  It was almost an exact copy of Star Ruler, but it was worse.  The UI was a bit dull and boring, and at times caused me to accidently click or unclick things and have to redo stuff.  5 hours in a normal game and I still couldn't really do anything at all.  Meh, I just can't find a single good thing to say about the game, other than a slightly unique diplomacy system. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trite, shallow and derivative. On anything but the easiest settings the AI simply swarms you the moment you try to expand or colonize at all with massive rushes of ships boasting heavily researched weapons, while also managing lots of successful colonies. Any two of those may be somewhat possible, definitely not all three at once. I had expected quite a bit more  perhaps something other than mindless pop-rushing of batches of ships. A bit of strategy and management would be nice. As far as I can tell, it's a 1x strategy game, not a 4x, unless you manage to trick the computer into letting you survive until late game, when management becomes something of an issue. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game, with out question, is some of the most unmitigated garbage I have ever had the displeasure of purchasing. The game itself is brutally buggy, with above average BSOD rates, and numerous crashes. A considerable amount of players are simply unable to even start the game without confusing fixes, or mods. The game itself is flat and uninteresting, with little difference between the races, and NO difference between how they react to you. The AI itself can only be described as "Game Ruining." It is intensely brutal, and utterly unforgiving in the most unpleasant way. (It also doesn't have to use the game's horrific GUI and exceedingly tedious ship design mechanics).

The ONLY saving grace of this game is the modding community, and a plethora of rabid, active fans who are eager to apologize for their dev putting out trash, and selling it for 30$.

DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"this game has potential but..."
It's still in beta form, terrible user interface, very poor tutorial, micromanagment, no explanation of Hotkeys, etc.  I have no idea why so many give it such a high score.  Maybe it will be patched into a good game, but it still needs work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pros:
• Combat is good.
•	Designing a ship is fun initially.
•	AI uses your own designs against you.
•	Actively involved developer.
•	Lots of potential down the road.
•	Graphics and sound are good.
Cons:
•	Exploration is uninspired.
•	Buggy/late game frame rate issues.
•	Not polished.
•	Major notifications are lacking.  (ie: when planets are idle, ships reaching destination, etc)
•	No rally point for ship building.
•	Needs more research.
•	Ship design becomes tedious.
•	Low replayability.
Overall:
Rather bland 4X game but has lots of potential especially from modders.  Although the developer is active it’s still a small team.  There is some concern that significant needed improvements might take a while to be released.  Hold off for now but keep an eye on this one.  Time will tell. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After finding the amount of high ratings on this site I had to write a review on this game. Simply put, it could have been great. The developer promised so many great things for the game as an early access supporter. When the game launched, it was really just a flop. It was really just the beta but with a higher price tag, and the developer decided that he would use your wasted $30.00 to fund a sequel that had all of his features that he promised originally. Don't buy this game, don't support this developer, and go buy Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion. At least I can actually enjoy that game... One more note, I know that it was a single person developer, but that doesn't mean he can just stop supporting his games and make empty promises. Intrusion 2 was created by a single developer, and that game is extremely better than the mere 2 hours I put into the release of Stardrive. It took the single developer 3 years to create Intrusion 2. Why can't this developer have the same perseverance and drive that the Intrusion 2 developer has? Just because you don't like a product that you have created doesn't mean you have to abandon it and make a new game. Think about that the next time you want to disappoint people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good graphics, thats it. Buy it used. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This review by IGN is misleading. They didn't review how it works on-line, only on how it works on a LAN network. On a lan network, I'm sure it will work just fine, but on the internet, it is just simply horrible. And the bugs...don't let me get started on the bugs. The 1.04 patch fixes somes of them, but it still is a dissapointment. The only perk are the extra civs, units, music and scenarios. But even that doesn't warrant a price of $30 dollars. DON'T GET THIS EXPANSION IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO PLAY ONLINE!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to agree with the negative guys on this one. It gets 2 from me for being able to change Freestyle superstars on the fly and for the added depth in dynasty mode; but its hard to put up with Point guards scoring far too easily, characters not so much skidding but actually freezing on court, the constant rebounding problem which EA seem to refuse to fix and the now lessened camera angles to choose from.. Even with the patch the game doesn't feel great. I also give the opinion that this isnt worth the money this year and i will be taking my copy back for a refund. Its sad to see how lttile attention to detail that there is in this years version of the series. Poor form EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea is actually pretty fun, sadly it doesn't deliver. The big additions to the game are mega towers (their answer to not expanding the city size). Omega. An addictive substance that causes mass pollution and The Academy; a place for research.  Really, once you have tried those, there is not much else. Omega is especially one of those things you need to dedicate most of a city to. The footprints for the mega towers are so enourmous that they become hard to find spaces for. Especially in some of Sim City's already cramped maps. And there are the bugs. Bugs that have existed since release are still around. Despite it supposedly being patched, I still watch various trucks try to deliver to the same place. Mega towers seem to cause everything to wildly fluctuate in a way that doesn't make sense. Even if you have enough to support it.  Overall not enough was fixed or added for me to want to play with what the majority of this expansion adds on a regular basis. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This expansion is small DLC for full exp price, to already broken game. I think EA cannot be serious about this cash in released in beta state. Old Sim City was legendary game but this  is out of control. Stop Raping Sim City franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Logged 50+ hours into the game and can tell you it is an absolute bugfest even now by 2015. Yes, that's right, EA just ignored the bugs and have moved on to making a new version.

It is fun at first until you put in some time and get your city up and running then all the glitches, lack of good information(you get notices 'more workers needed!' but the indicators do not tell you which of the three types of workers is lacking). All in all, just skip this game or be an idiot like me and let EA once again steal from you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Parappa The Rapper might have been successful on the PSX, but this Remaster offers almost nothing new. Actually, this remaster makes the game even more frustrating than before.

At first glance, the game looks much more better than before, but for the PS4 standers, it's kind of lacking, but it still looks good, with the cool paper-like animations. Some designs are outdated, though.

The songs are still here, but the extras are just remixes (just like the PSP version).

Gameplay, oh god, how did they mess it up even more? At first, it looks simple, but it becomes a trainwreck due to the timing being completely unfair. I'm not saying it's not passable, but it's much more frustrating than before. You might think you hit the right button at the right time, just for it to punish you. This gets worse in later stages/songs.

The game is just as short as the original, so you can finish it in one sitting. For 15 dollars, it's not worth it. It's hard to recommend, as there's almost nothing nothing new here. I found Parappa The Rapper 2 more enjoyable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pros: It's beautiful. The Music is nice and soothing. Source Engine = Runs well
===========================================
Cons: I played it for 7 hours and I can honestly say that no more than maybe 5 minutes were actually some kind of fun.
The mission objectives send you from one remote corner of the map to the other, without making much sense but to draw you into some random gunfights.
The enemies may be miles away, but they hit you with absolute accuracy, sometimes before you see them, making you wonder what the heck hit you.
Problem here is that the gameplay is simply annoying not challenging as it should be.
The hacking minigame is confusing at first, I never really understood it, but I found out that the sequence SHIELD, OVERFLOW, ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK and so on produces the best results.
But the worst aspect of the game is the save point system. The save points are only at the end of a mission, and some missions are quite long!
Not being able to save for sometimes more than a hour is absolutely killing this game. You won't risk anything just in order to survive, spoiling all the fun that's still left.
Because of that, I set the game difficulty down to "Chicken" (which equals to Normal in any other game) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is extremely overrated.This is supposed to be a cyberpunk of sort, but the best strategy still is "shoot everything that moves". Sure, you may hack your way into the enemy's mind, too bad the hacking minigame is too slow for a game where every enemy keeps respawning around you. So, let's say you're hidden in a dark dark alley and start hacking. I don't know if all respawning enemies are already aware of your presence or they just have a jedi like intuition, point is unless you're using the cloak ability anything can see you, even when they're too far for you to see them yourself. So now you're under attack. What would you do? Of course, close the hacking window and shoot back! TOO BAD pressing "esc" brings you back to the pause menu. You have to click on the X button in the upper right to close the window. But that's not all for clunky controls: you have to manually reload most of your weapons by hitting "r", even when they're completely empty, which is exactly the kind of useless mechanic that adds nothing to the gameplay and only makes it more frustrating. Some psy powers look a bit clunky as well, but at least they work. Speaking of clunky: this game could have used a basic tutorial corridor. You will of course see a few messages on screen, and these messages will point you to watch the video tutorials.It's also supposed to be an rpg. Enjoy your lack of any kind of map then! Oh, and did I mention that your "base" is a ridiculously huge, scarcely lit area? You will need 2 to 4 minutes to reach a vendor. Graphics: here is another flaw. Having either almost monochome environments or huge, dimly lit areas mostly painted in shades of orange and  teal gets boring very soon, even sooner that being killed by instagib weapons every now and then. Beside, you can't actually hide in a dark corner unless you already are completely invisible, so there's no excuse for the chronic lack of actual light. Word of notice here: if you actually LIKE orange and teal rubbish, as some people actually do, consider this a 4/10.So here's the thing with this game: if this was an half life 2 mod, I'd rate it 6/10 which could easily become 8/10 if someone decided to improve this game and polish all those clunky mechanics. This however isn't a mod, I actually had to pay 20â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel that i pay an Alpha version, so many bugs keep me away from being able to play it in good condition. After hours of trying it, levelling my character, i had the worst bug ever  character level reset. Painful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

More than anything it's a missed opportunity. Everything about the same seems to weep "We couldn't finish this game, so we kicked it out the door as a value title." The textures and landscape of the world are threadbare and boring -- while many of the characters in contrast look tremendously polished. The tutorial is ineffectual and for a title with such a vast suite of features that's really a shame... If you're like me you'll fiddle with the parts you can understand then ultimately push it aside for something more rewarding, less frustrating, or even just for something that might seem like it has a unified art style. Skip this title -- it's not worth it even for $10. Could have been SOOOOO much more. A shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The force feedback on the PS4 for the T300RS is terrible. It's so bad that turning it off is really the only viable solution at present. It feels like they've just copied and pasted the algorithm from TDU1 (which also had dire FF implementation). They need to re-write this code from the bottom up. However, as they did nothing to improve this in the TDU series, I expect them to do absolutely nothing with this title also. How can they continue to think that their FF code is acceptabe? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Going into this game I was expecting a lot. The trailers and intros had me fooled into thinking I was buying a next gen game, I was not! In the open world I found myself scratching my eyeballs out, asking why? Why? did I pay $70 for this game, why? Why all the why's you may ask? Well the graphics in this game were s**t! Believe me when saying the graphics in Need for Speed Underground which I use to play on my PlayStaion 2 were better. I could only push myself to play 20 minutes of this game so cant say anymore than don't buy it.

Signed an honest gamer 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is that people continue buying Ubisoft games?. The Crew has a terrible story (not that you buy a racing game for its plot), outdated graphics (almost PS2 quality) and a plethora of glitches that will keep you raging for hours.

Please vote with your wallet and stop supporting Ubisoft. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another poor, unfinished, lifeless game created and released for profit by Ubisoft. The first problem I have with this game are the inclusion of micro-transactions. If I pay decent money for a game, the LAST thing I expect is micro-transactions, it's unacceptable.  I drive around in cars which don't feel good, the best racing games make the car feel alive, like you're actually driving in a Lamborghini or a Ferrari. On this, it feels like an empty box with two wheels. Not to mention you drive around a lifeless terrain, filled with nothingness. I just don't get it, such a poor game, could of been so much better. I'm not buying another Ubisoft game again after this and Watch dogs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoyed the first two like I did, skip this installment due to the following: Crashes to desktop, hangs infinitely loading maps, can't mute ANYone's mic (so you get to hear someone's broken mic going completely crazy the entire match), lobby "host" gets to kick you if you kill them too much, grappling hook randomly goes where it wants (fires when you press it only 90% of the time), LAG oh how horrible the lag is which gives crap connections an advantage (you can be melee-ing someone multiple times from behind when you suddenly die from the same person), character animations used to be really smooth now they're N64 style, graphics are seriously mid-tier for PC (you will get stuck in the environment and you will take damage for it as well), weapon selection is crap now there is seriously a HUGE step back in variety with this game, mech (mech not MECHS) are almost non-existent and good for a spam kill or two before blowing up...the list of how frustrating this game is can go on for about an hour.

HUGE step back in the franchise, avoid it, the campaign is typical attempt to appeal to us "westerners" with it's new (horribly boring) story. Another reviewer also said it, Lost Planet 3 is trying to be like Dead Space now with it's atmosphere (even the menu music sounds like Dead Space's!), and they fail miserably. Wait for this game to be $5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has amazing graphics and awesome gameplay/story. Seriously fantastic. I was going to leave a praising review until I got to the crab boss on Mission 4. So, there were other crab creatures like it that were killed without the rig and in the rig. But this fight is cheatingly special. You'll find the YouTube videos of other gamers highlighting the stupidity of the game creators but not like me. So, firstly, the morons who keep going into the "over the shoulder" view. Fine... Just dont be stupid like in this game. Be sure when adding this stupid view you can toggle it off because it causes problems when fleeing attacks. Such as, not being able to see where the heII you're going because the camera angle blinds you and although the crab is no where on the screen when fleeing to the left you somehow still get hit. Who knows why? So, you always MUST dodge to the right thanks to the over the shoulder stupid ass view. (retards). And although you may spend 45 minutes fighting this crab boss his shell will not bust off. No matter how many times you run out of heavy ammo and shoot it with the crap pistol. The crab actually glitches in place and you can shoot every part over and over again (the weak parts). and you guessed it!! Nothing happens.... The back of the crab doesnt shoot off and you basically have no choice but to stop playing. Its a great game up until that point and then its a total piece of SHlT... So, since I cant get my money back from the PS store I hope I can fix these dumb asses who keep going with the over the shoulder view. They are too damn stupid to understand the logistical concerns when cutting off 180 degrees of view from your in game player... idiots these days.. messin up our music and games.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Launch issues and bugs aside, this game is extremely boring. Most of your matches will be spent trying to find randomly spawned items only to end up dead. Because your team refuses to cooperate or you can't find what you need to escape. If that sounds fun to you, pay the $40 and enjoy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is okay, it does get boring though. I honestly regret buying the game, at least with the current state it's in becasue they have so many glitches and it ruins the gameplay. You run into a lot of people that don't have mics and at that point you may as well find another lobby because with no communication it makes winning harder than normal. I wouldn't pay anything over $9.99 for it and if I didn't have more than the time needed for a refund I would of gladly asked for my money back. If the developers will actually fix the glitches and bugs in the game then it has the potential to be a better game, but until then it's not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so horrible. The controls are so choppy that after 5 minutes of playing it you are ready to recycle it. I strongly suggest to pass on this game because it is a joke for a hockey game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's comical how the fanboys tell us to ignore the lacking career mode and the overall poor gameplay this title has to offer. You know what is really sad? EA Sports NASCAR games had better physics. Nuff said. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Needing a quick RPG fix, and finding this on Steam, I automatically assumed this game was a new addition to the TDE: Drakensang series and bought it without checking further. Very stupid move :(

Expecting something akin to Drakensang starting this game was like getting a punch in the face.

The UI is laughable compared to that of the Drakensang games. Whereas the game itself scales to any resolution, the UI is really low res. Gone are the nice, efficient inventory system of Drakensang, and instead we get the typical list inventory obligatory for any multi platform game (consoles, apparently, can not render grids). Being able to save manually is obviously not supported, as consoles don't support this either.

The RPG system has been dumbed down pretty much across the board, and you have less of everything in terms of skills, abilities, spells and item stats.
The combat and overall gameplay has been dumbed down as well, but to be honest I didn't play it very long so maybe it picks up after a while...

The graphics are on par with Drakensang at best, but since this was released 4 years later that is not very impressive.

To summarize, I don't know why they bothered with a PC version at all. They actually did include more than a dozen video options, but that seems to be the only change they made for the PC version aside from reassigning the keys. With all the brilliant RPG's available on PC I simply don't see why anyone would get this game, unless they sink to my level of incompetency and buy it without reading the reviews.

On a console this game might be a decent effort, and I am sure it compares more favorably to the games available there, but if you are a PC gamer I would much rather get the old Drakensang games, or one of the decent new RPG's like Witcher 2 or Skyrim. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted this game to be good.  I love top-down dungeon crawlers, action RPG's, and fantasy games in general and have been looking forward to this game almost since it's announcement.  That being said, I was really disappointed with this game.  Money is too hard to come by now to just throw it at any game that comes out and this game is not worth the money; if I had known just how bad it was I wouldn't have bought it at all.  Even if the price is substantially reduced I will not re-purchase it.  I got lucky and bought mine pre-owned, the first bad sign (I bought it pre-owned on the day of it's release!), so I was able to return the game for a full refund.  I brought my copy home eagerly threw it in my xbox and was immediately unimpressed.  The graphics at the menu were atrocious and that filled me with some worry.  Once the game started it was obvious that there is a serious lack of graphical prowess and for a game hyped that much it should have been at least a little nicer.  The introduction hastily introduced the main characters without really giving us any reason to care about them at all, the voice acting was horrible (even Lucy Lawless couldn't help this game out; her voice acting was just as bad as the main characters).  Once again I have to go back to the graphics.  What the hell were they thinking!?  My wife usually will sit with me when I get a new game to check it out to see if she wants to play it and she couldn't even stand watching it for more that 15 minutes!  This is supposed to be an action RPG but there is no inventory at all; all you can do is switch out your current weapon and only have one piece of armor at a time.  In a hack and slash you would also think that there would be some potion inventory to regain health or mana but you could only carry one of each at a time.  the combat was lackluster at best.  I never actually felt drawn into the game.  The archer shoots as if she is on speed or cocaine and the warrior can't take a hit to save his life.  Whats the point of designing the dynamic around tanking with the warrior while the archer picks them off from afar when he goes down like a sack of dirty laundry when ever a few enemies get too close.  I didn't try the co-op at all.  I couldn't force myself to play the game anymore; i have no idea if it is any good or if it is broken as some claim.  If the developer had spent just a little more time tweaking the graphics and the controls and added some sort of inventory system this could have been a playable game but as it stands right now I don't see much value in this game.  If I were thinking about buying this game I would wait if I were you.  This was completely disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Amazing. Simply amazing.I' m a french user and it's the first time the dubbing is really killing a game...... just awfull, pathetic..... i really lack words to describe the french version (most french version are bad, but here it's far worse than bad). And not just dubbing/actor plays, even the translation is catastrophic as much of speeches have no sense at all. Too bad 'cause the game have some things that are not so bad : the universe is nice, coherent (at least graphically, hard to say for the story....), coop play, dungon editor...... but also gameplay a little light (especially rpg part) and not well balanced at all. Overall an average game that is more than drag down here in france by it's pathetic adaptation. Please, next time just add subtitles like Rockstar studio. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here is the straight scoop on this one. Avoid at all cost. I put this game in and I swear to god I thought I was looking at a PS1 game. The graphics are that dated. The animation on the enemies awful, the story been there done that. Your character shouts out the same few lines over and over which gets old real quick. The level design uninspired, the loot hunting boring, even the text and UI looks like it was stripped out of a game made in the 90's pre-next gen. The co-op online is serviceable but how much longevity you can suck out of this will depend on weather are not the community buys the game and I do not see alot of support for this game in the coming months. Very, very disappointed. Wait a few days and save your sixty dollars for either Infamous 2 or Red Faction. Or better yet go back and play or pick-up the excellent L.A. Noire. "Pass" -Stu- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is boring as hell, please don't buy it! Even In co-op mode you find yourself always doing the same thing over and over again. Here's how it goes ; a door blow up and a wave of enemies comes at you( I think there's 4-5 different enemies in the entire game), walk a bit, defend a strategic point ( by killing waves ) and then start all over again. Can It be saved by the storyline? Not at all ; 2 miserable mercenaries killing monsters. Also It's one of this RPG with no loot and also no point of getting money whatsoever since there's no shop and no upgrades. I was able to do the entire game with the same sword that I had at the beginning, not because I wanted to but because there was nothing else! You get a small skill tree that is totally useless and that's all. It's not like the game was developed by an indie company, it was made by Bethesda softworks!!! This game is bad and it will hunt me for the rest of my life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has linear level designs and has a twitchy camera. The game is drab and boring. The worst part is the shortness of the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good game only for schoolboys and girls, boring and have some **** service from devs. Bought it from some bundle and devs refused to give keys to their customers, I had to buy it for a second time!

With a game so broken and pitifully unchallenging, I uninstalled it as fast as I installed it. By the way, this game only uses a single core (so your other one or three or nine hundred don't go to use, making the game lag severely and making alt+tabbing impossible without crashing) and has alot more technical problems than just that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Avoid this game, dont buy it. The entire game looks and works like that is not professional. Have a lot of bug and the producers do not give attention for you.

A priori, les qualités essentielles au genre sont là pour faire de Blood Bowl un jeu hautement tactique au tour par tour mais ça c'est a priori, c'est-à-dire vu de loin... Quand on commence à creuser le machin, on se rend compte qu'il recèle une quantité astronomique de défauts malgré son humour rigolard.

Ses graphismes sont très moyens pour ne pas dire vilains même si cela s'avère secondaire dans un tour par tour. Mais surtout, son interface est très perfectible : tout ce vert sur le terrain sur lequel les cases de lancers de dés se confondent démontre que le jeu a été conçu par des personnes qui ne maîtrisent pas leur sujet. L'ensemble est confus et l'ergonomie la plus élémentaire est aux abonnés absents, idem pour les menus tarabiscotés aux couleurs criardes.

Il faut s'y faire et on finit... par s'y faire au bout de quelques matchs. Le pire est à venir cependant comme les tours en temps limité et surtout la règle du "turn over" qui implique de passer son tour pour un oui ou pour un non et pour un pet de travers.

Cette règle stupide, hélas incontournable, se révèle des plus horripilantes et tue tout le système de jeu. Ainsi, un joueur se fait tacler : on passe son tour : un joueur se fait péter la gueule : on passe son tour ; un joueur a perdu la baballe (non récupérée par l'adversaire, cela va de soi !) : on passe son tour quand même...

Chaque action échouée implique de passer la main, ce qui produit un rythme hâché regrettable. Et peu importe s'il reste 10 joueurs de son équipe qui attendent les ordres : rien à foutre, passe ton tour... connard. Comme les statistiques sont très défavorables et ne sont pas affichées (!), du genre une chance sur quatre pour accomplir la moindre action, on ne se risque pas à faire grand'chose, à part se castagner quand on le peut.

C'est là sans doute, la règle du jeu de plateau, non transposable directement au jeu vidéo : il faut un effort d'adaptation raisonnée dont Cyanide Studios a été incapable. Les erreurs de conception et le manque de jugement conduisent à un échec total. Foutus amateurs.

First off, a buggy release with a developer team working very hard and professionally to fix things.  Second, do not expect a great game experience, here is why:

You will get a limited character skill set, a limited story line that is completely linear (and woe to you if one proves impossible to complete, because you are done), and a world experience that consists of five or six vendors and four quest givers.

The online feature allows you to group but since it is unlikely your group members will be able to stay logged on that long, it is more a frustration than a useful feature.

The entire game reminds one of a noob area rather than a finished game.  You get near the end (unless you have one of two builds you will not complete the series) and you think - this is it, I can now explore the world.  Only there is no rest of the world.  The one thing that keeps you away from this is that the final adventure is impossible - again unless you have one of two builds.

Crashed mid game make you start to have many scenarios.

The universe wants a Shadowrun MMO, but this is not it.  It is a turn based replay of the old Microsoft Shadowrun team shooter.

Ignore the comments by others about lag and unreliability, except for crashes that knock your modem off line and take an hour to recover from, you won;t have lag and the game started reliable, and will be again.  The issue is the developers did not have the resources to make a compelling story or an interactive world.  In an age of sandboxes, handing someone two grains of sand for the price of Ipanema beach and then declaring that is the nature of beta is a poor market strategy.

Imagine if someone made a new Patrician game. You've got a "base" screen where you can buy various ships, equip them with armaments, buy cargo - and then click on a "Start" button, which gets you into the battle with some pirates, and depending on how many of your ships and how much cargo survives that battle, you'll have more money to buy some new ships and get better equipment and cargo for them.

Sure, it could be a fun little tactical game, but what would it actually have to do with the Patrician series? Where would the setting up of trade routes be, the politics, the complex economy - the actual depth of the game that people have come to expect?
It's the same with SR Chronicles. This game format is okay - not good, but okay - for Jagged Alliance, but it's deeply disappointing for Shadowrun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are okay, but the story is bad and the game contains a lot of bugs. With 2players coop you can play with your friend, and this is the only one good thing in this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know what the devs were thinking. This title is utter trash. Bethesda should know better. It's shallow, poorly implemented with extremely dated visuals, repetitive and boring. Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is absolutely miserable. and im not just talking about the HORRENDOUS voice acting and dialogue, and mediocre story. no, its extremely repetitive, and gets boring after the first half hour. it took everything dynasty warriors had, and made it all go wrong. if you can get past some of the most stressful game playing ive ever gone through, maybe youll find a good game. but i didnt. i just found more of the same thing to kill. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is fun and all. Of course, I have 2 major complaints. 1 is well, how random it is. but 2 is when I get really mad. I'm really mad that when I unlock a class, once I beat the game, I can't pick it as a starting class, making me do all the stuff to unlock that class ALL OVER AGAIN. It's extremely annoying for me to enjoy a class when I can only do it by going through like, about 20 weeks just to get the class I wanted to play again. I feel like they should of made it that if you unlock a class, you can then pick it as your starting class. But once I found out that you have to unlock the class ALL OVER AGAIN once you start a new game, I pretty much just stopped liking the game.

Alive has taken stepS back from reflex. on reflex the rider was much better and had better control of the bike. he didnt look like a goon out there and a gorrilla riding the bike, it was to scale way better. and when you jump on this game it looks like you are going to go far then it slows you down in the air and makes you case jumps. the power of the bikes suck and the graphics are not as good either. and also sometimes when you jump the screen and everything moves and puts the bike back straight UNREAL, and scrubbing and whipping are not as good on reflex I know on reflex there is some out of control scrubs and whips but thats more real than the bike just moving sideways at least it looked more real. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't help playing this game and thinking "What it could have been" because the overall controls and mechanics are much improved and work really well BUT THQ decided that it would be a good idea to take out all the content from reflex. Now there's basically no game modes, vehicle types, or anything else for that matter. This game is basically a demo of Reflex. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are good, and so is the music, but even a beginner can say this is far too easy, and boring its the same thing each time and it gets real old real fast! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garbage. I'm trying out all the major baseball games, this being the second, and it's awful compared to the first game I tried, High Heat, a far more intuitive game. As for this one, the game play is just too exasperating, with ho-hum graphics. The Game Revolution review nails it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not worth getting. Its a Counter Strike wanna-be. The movement and gameplay is crap, in my opinion.If only i could have played a demo before i bought the game, i wouldn't have bought it.Oh well. I learnt my lesson. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not a whole game. This is an insult.
These are the things I thought of while playing this game:
1. NO ONE involved in this game played the previous EA PGA games.
2. The physics are great.
3. This is NOT the scale a next-gen game (commentary is repetitive, few courses, a laughable character creator.)
4. NO ONE beta tested this game and gave feedback...
5. This feels like a demo.
6. EA, you had 2 YEARS to make this game... You're a billion dollar company.. "EA sports. It's in the game.." .... no, it's up your nose.
7. Rory, I don't know who you are, (I don't follow professional golf) but you will now always be "that guy that put his name on a terrible demo".
8. Night golf is an iPhone game.
9. I'm dusting off my XBOX360 to play Tiger '13: Masters Edition.
10. I'M DUSTING OFF MY XBOX360 to play TIGER WOODS 2013: Masters Edition...... (maybe I'll buy a PS2 to play Tiger 2010.....) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When will people learn that we have to start the boycott of EA sports.  They have had a monopoly on sports gaming for too long and continue to pump out crap to the masses.  People continue to buy and EA continues to make money.  As long as the money continues to spill in we can never expect EA to make a half decent game again...why would they if they can half ass it and still make millions.  We need 2K or another challenger to step in and give people a choice....then watch the EA empire crumble or actual make a good game for a change. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fundamentally disappointing effort - especially for anyone who buys this for the single-player career mode.  God only knows why, but EA decided to strip out a ton of features (most of which seem pretty basic) in this mode while also cutting way back on the number of courses and actual PGA Tour Pros.  Not sure how they spent the two years this was supposedly in development, but I can't imagine this game was given much time or attention by the team there.  In addition to the crappy career mode, the overall gameplay production is also pretty terrible.  The post-shot player animations are extremely dated, the crowd animations appear to be from circa 2002, and the play-by-play commentary is awful (I know there will be some repeats, but little to no effort was put into this aspect).  The one good thing to come out of this is that I've learned my lesson about pre-ordering anything from EA Sports.  It's a $60 lesson, but hopefully it will keep me from making bad investments like this in the future.  If you haven't bought it yet, wait a while till the price drops - no sane person could possibly justify spending $60 on this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utterly disappointing single player career mode.

Too few courses!

Too few golfers!

EA: Please, PLEASE update this game ASAP with the old style of Career Mode. Bring back the game face feature so I can customize my player to my specs.

The gameplay itself is different, but that's to be expected with everything considered. Solid enough IMO.

Please learn from what made this game GREAT in the past. It suited those seeking both single player career mode and multiplayer.

If this version had 75% of the career mode that pga 14 had... This review would be an 8 EASY with room for improvement 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll start off with the positives.  I really like the actual game and the gameplay.  It's actually a pretty fun game and reminds me of Tiger Woods 09, a game I played tons.  Graphics aren't amazing but it's a golf game so that doesn't really bother me personally.

I gave this game a 2 because all the potential it has, has gone to waste.  I'm sick of paying for games that are half assed done.  As other people have said, there are a lack of characters and courses.  Really that's not even a big deal because for the most part I like career mode.  Problem is, career mode sucks because  all the things that made this game so amazing in the past are gone.  You go to create a character and you have around 15 generic faces to choose from.  You have your 3 body type settings.  Your hair styles are generic, can't even choose eye or face shape, and that's it.  Clothing is your typical golf shirts that leave no room for making your character unique.

It's basically what you'd expect from a golf game you got off of ps plus for $19.  Again the actual golfing is fun, but don't expect anything more than that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In their rush to say "look, we're next-gen now!" the developers seem to have forgotten to include the game along with the graphics. Like in the 360 and PS3 versions, the creation suite has been destroyed, with most of the custom animations gone along with custom stories, finishers, and even music. Somehow the current gen version has managed to go one step forward and not only remove that but also custom arenas, belts, and female CAWs. But at least the last-gen versions have matches in them. There are over forty match types that were present in 2K14 but are missing in 2K15. There have been more match types REMOVED than actually exist in the game. There's a reason this game was review embargoed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Coming from someone who tries their best to really enjoy every game I buy at full price, I just can't get behind this one. WWE's debut on next-gen just feels empty, lacking that feeling of control that made the past two entries worth picking up. The very first thing you'll notice is the music; instead of being greeted by John Cena's theme on startup, you get a playlist of "current" songs from the most random genre pools that never seems different.. You'll consistently hear "Ready" by B.o.B followed by "Workin'" by Big Smo every other cycle. While I will admit to liking most of the songs, none of them (even the so called WWE Version of "Wild Ones" doesn't exactly scream wrestling) feel at home in a WWE game. Beyond the weird mix of rap, rock, country, and dubstep, the main problem with the soundtrack is the absolute lack of variety. No longer do you have over twenty themes to pick from as in 2k14, but a grand total of twelve. You'll hear these songs a lot, because the creation suite takes a godawfully long time to do just about anything. When you're just trying to find a good pair of pants within the small selection you're given, listening to Flo Rida for the fifth time gets aggravating quickly. Speaking of the character creation suite, gone is most of what made it fun. I never used any of the crazier options present in WWE 13 or 2k14, but the variety was nice. Here, every CAW will look the same regardless of tweaking. You can no longer pad out the small Divas roster with created divas, either. This presents a huge problem given the love the community has for content creation. At the very least, you can finally edit Superstar outfits to create, for example, the current look of Dean Ambrose without sacrificing authenticity. Clothing options are just poorly thought out. In addition to the lackluster CAW suite, the MyCAREER mode is nothing special. Sure, you can now start from the bottom and work your way up, unlike putting a created Superstar into Universe, but playing through the first four tutorial matches with Bill DeMott yelling at you is truly an experience. They get points for realism, but you'll hear the same couple lines every time he feels your performance is lacking. In the tutorial match where you essentially have to let your opponent beat the Christ out of you in order to kick out of a pin, you'll hear him telling you how terrible you're doing at least every minute. After that, it's much of the same. The graphics actually are pretty good, if you really need a positive thing to say about this game. Well, that's going a bit far. They're good to a degree. Some wrestlers really do look like they should. Cody Rhodes, Chris Jericho, and Randy Orton are shining examples. Meanwhile, John Cena, Dean Ambrose, and Dolph Ziggler just look off. John Cena and Dean Ambrose are particularly bad, due in part to the popularity they had while the game was in development. John Cena looks like a caveman with his gigantic forehead and cartoon-like facial animations. Dean Ambrose, meanwhile, just looks washed out like he's got a terrible filter over his model. What really matters, though, is the modes. What you really play. How are those? Well, the 29 you're presented with aren't too bad. It sounds like a huge number, doesn't it? It's really not. Everything in One on One is the same as in 6-man aside from the total number of Superstars currently active, so there's really only eleven match types. Not bad, but not the total representation that could have been. You can no longer tweak the matches beyond who participates, what the arena is, and if there's a manager in the match. This makes for some exceptionally boring singles matches, and the total lack of variety really shows. Pacing during a match has been severely hampered by the addition of Chain Wrestling, a series of rock-paper-scissors and quick-time events the AI unfairly cheats at, which combined with the spotty counters and inhuman timing required to pull them off results in odd matches and ridiculous comeback victories. All in all, the game falls far short of the expectations set by 2k14. While the past few entries have been flawed, they succeeded in being fun if nothing else. The most fun I had with 2k15 was actually playing random singles matches to provide material for this review, so if you're creative enough to come up with your own stories and matches, you'll probably have fun for a little while. Universe is still the way to go for that instant WWE fix, but with a roster that's already outdated and almost no way to fix it yourself using CAW to tweak current Superstar looks or new additions to the rosters, it's going to eventually become just as mundane as the rest of the game. To be clear, the game succeeds where it counts for wrestling fans: It's a decent game for those hardcore fans. For the average wrestling fan that prefers the feel of 2k14, it's an offering best skipped. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me start with this. The graphic and gameplay are infinitely better than they have been. If that was the only change this game would have been a solid 9. Unfortunately it isn't. It starts with the removal of female caws (cause girls don't play games right?) and then continues to gut the entire creation sweet to near uselessness. There's about half the roster size and a third the match types of it last iteration. And the famed career mode is more akin to something you'd see in a madden game than a wrestling game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is this the best you can do 2K, seriously? The amount of problems this game has are too numerous to count, so I'll just highlight a few problems.

Firstly, why do ALL the women in this game look utterly stupid? What's going on with the hair? Why does Summer Rae look like a deformed mannequin, for instance? Not only that, why do half the wrestlers look absolutely nothing like they are supposed to - CM Punk looks like some random Italian guy, for example? This is next gen? Really?

Secondly, career mode. How quick did it take you to shat out that garbage 2K? It makes zero sense. You can have a four and a half star match, lose narrowly, then have Vickie Guerrero say that that match was dreadful. That's just one contradiction - the whole thing is full of them. Do it bloody properly or don't do it at all.

Third - it's now 2015, and we have to manually change title holders, as far as I can tell? WHY?! Why on earth isn't an option to regularly patch the game up to the current roster, heel/face changes, title holders, theme musics and more? In fact, this is such a glaring omission I'm not sure if I'm just outright missing where it is?

Fourth, why is this game an utterly stripped down version of 2k13 and 2k14? Why have you taken multiple steps backwards in presentation, gameplay and options? Why am I stuck with crap generic pop songs as the background music instead of the theme songs? Why do rope breaks happen at random? Why is the tag team mode utterly broken if you play single player, to the point where the AI will NEVER tag you in? Finally, WHY ARE YOU CHARGING MONEY FOR THIS GAME!

FFS 2k, get a damn grip of yourselves. This is a joke of a title, and it disrespects wrestling fans at every turn by treating them like absolute idiots. Give up the licence you clowns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pros: In Ring Game Play; Graphics; Custom Logos; Ability To Edit Current Wrestlers To A Degree; 2k Showcase Is Good

Cons: No Create A Diva, Title, Arena, Story Designer, or Create A Finisher; No Custom MP3 Music & Entrance Motions VERY Limited; Limited Match Selection; Stale MyCareer Mode; Paying for Modes That Should Already Be In The Game; Terrible Commentary

This game definitely shows promise in terms of in ring ability. I wrote an article/wishlist of improvements and features I would love to see in the game. The puzzling part about WWE games is similar to Madden they continue to omit incredible features and add unimpressive ones rather than build on their product.  This is the definitely of a bare bone game. WWE 2k15 strips out all the fun and is a reflection of the product we get on Smackdown on Thursday nights. They could've literally skipped this title, however; like I said before this series has incredible potential. This game could be the NXT of the WWE rather than the Smackdown/Raw. If they build on this game and re-implement the best features from previous installments 2K has the potential of creating a firewall 10 "Game of the Year" game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Borderline shovelware tripe with simplistic, uninspired gameplay, ugly visuals and repetitive levels. The game's much-touted humor is very rarely witty, mostly falling flat on its face. Oddly, Deadpool's 4th-wall breaking antics more than once make fun of the game's paltry budget and tiresome clichés, a fact which helps precious little in making the whole ordeal any more bearable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing game. I really don't have issue with anything other than the gameplay. Wildly incompetent release. Attack animations for enemies are immune to damage, while your attack animations are not. Many times you will die mid Overdrive, while your enemies will be kept from dying by performing their attack subroutine. Especially Mr. Sinister. I knew the game had problems when they went out of the way to tell you that you can be hurt while jumping, which is this gamer's first instinct. The endgame really displays the cheapness and amateurish execution of the enemies. They actually recycle enemies you have already beaten just to pad the game out. Then they pile on wave after wave of Sinisters, again showing their complete lack of care as to how the game plays itself out. Shockingly bad game. I wonder if the Activision team knew they were going to get laid off, and basically just tried to sabotage the game. I will take a long, hard look at High Moon Studios before I EVER buy anything else they are concerned with. Anyone who gives this P.O.S. over a 5 is either a plant, a hopeless fanboy, or they didn't bother to play the game all the way through. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

deadpool,is a funny game but the humor masks a flawed gaming experience the enemy types are the same the gunfire is flawed the combat feels unfinished and the upgrade system is odd you have to upgrade the weapons before the character upgrade and the game is too short. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible.

I took a chance and bought this game because a number of people claim that if you enjoyed Persona 4 that you will enjoy this. They cannot be more wrong.

The relationships developed between characters in this game are so shallow as to be little more that tropes. The sexual euphemisms and imagery are as subtle as penis jokes when eating a hot dog.

The combat is the only thing even slightly interesting and was quite fun, but the intermissions between dungeon crawls made me wretch to badly that my stomach is now located somewhere in the region of my adams apple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was quite enjoying the game for the first 30 minutes until I shifted somewhere I apparently wasn't supposed to and got stuck literally in the middle of a wall. After recovering from save the game forgot to give me back the "luminaries" I collected to the point making progress impossible.
What is it with game companies lately? I understand its a small independent developer and cannot afford a proper QA department but just get one of your children to play through and get rid of at least the obvious critical bugs before releasing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is infuriating and sub-standard for so many reasons. It's riddled with bugs and seemingly inexplicable phenomena. To name but a few: I've had mercs spotted through walls, enemies alerted to a mercs presence for no apparent reason (yes I understand the stealth mechanics), enemy AI is appalling (you can eliminate a building full of enemies but just running a merc around the perimeter of the building, thus alerting the enemies, and then shooting them all as they come out of the door), the game is riddled with typos (e.g. some of the mercs have a trait called 'though', which is obviously meant to be 'tough'), the voices acting is poor and annoying (who honestly wants to have their merc scream the same phrase over and over again every time you select them?), the towns are lifeless and dull (filled with aimlessly wandering NPCs who interact with nothing, they remind me of playing Ultima). There's also myriad other infuriating gameplay problems, such as when you stealth melee someone in crouch mode, you inexplicably change to run mode after the kill, which means if you move, you automatically alert everyone in the area to your presence), NPCs also have a tendency to block you into confined spaces (I've had a merc stuck in a garage for an entire mission because a child decided to sit on the floor in the only exit and refused to move). Dialogue is appalling and the sub-quests uninteresting. Combat is unfulfilling and tedious (the rag-doll bodies are about the most satisfying part) and generally consists of endlessly having to reload whilst you try and make-up for the non-sensical mechanics (e.g. tell a merc to shoot an enemy that is running towards them, and if the enemy passes out of sight for a second (e.g. to run around a tree) the order is cancelled and your merc generally ends up dying unless you continually re-tell him to shoot the target. Other problems elevate the game to the height of tedium (why, for example, when buying and selling items can you not just cycle through the various mercs, rather than having to individually move each merc to the vendor?). The game feels like an unfinished b-movie. You might overlook these things if it were Â£10 (but even then it'd annoy the hell out of you) but for Â£30 you expect a game to have proper A.I., a user-friendly interface and acceptable game mechanics. Back in Action has none of these. It is a franchise that has clearly not moved on since the last decade, which is a shame, because I really wanted to enjoy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How someone can screw up a remake of such a great game is beyond me. They had everything. The story, the maps, the weapons etc. They could have just COPIED everything with better graphics, and most fans would have bought this game outright.The AI is very erratic. Most of the times it just seems stuck. It ignores weapon ranges and tries to hit you with a shotgun, 120 yards away. Other times it moves in loops without actually doing something useful.There is no fog of war. You enter a map, and you can see where everyone is. No surprises, no suspense. The plan&Go is an ok mechanic but in no way as good as the round based system in the original.The management aspect has been botched extremely. You don't have to pay your soldiers regularly, you just "buy" them. An illogical and unnecessary streamlining.  On the other hand you have to arm militia by hand like in XCOM. But the militia can be so numerous, that you have to arm 30 people by hand. Why?Even the story presentation is bad. How can someone make cutscenes which look WORSE and more ugly than in the 13 year old original, with its minimalistic graphics?Sorry, how someone can fail so badly in doing a remake with had nearly perfect mechanics is beyond me. Please don't buy this game, or we have to endure comparable **** games in the future! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you liked jagged alliance, chances are you won't like this game. Whilst the developers have supposedly innovated with a plan and go system, they have clearly cut corners everywhere else and also while they are at it, robbed your grandma. The game feels like jagged alliance interpreted through creative ballet. Without fog of war the game is severely broken. It was in the early dev version supposedly but became "too hard" to play. A sheer remake on a new graphical platform and fixing and improving would have been awesome. I get the distinct feeling the developers drank all day instead of coding, scratched this together in a week and are laughing all the way to the bank knowing the nostalgic steam users will grab it and give it a run, without trusting the overwhelmingly negative reviews. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

JA: Back in Action is an unfinished mess, with loads of bugs, such as sometimes not being able to target prone enemies, some pieces of terrain not blocking line of sight for the enemy soldiers and so on. It also contains questionable game-play decisions, such as no FOW, no tactical overlays, no difficulty setting (the game is way to easy), no way to change squad formation. If compared to the old Jagged Alliance 2, the game is also lacking in content and strategic gameplay.  Gone is the need to train militia, now the militia pop up when you capture a place, unarmed though so you need to collect weapons and run around handing them to every single militia soldier in the area, and if you want to upgrade their weapons you have to do the whole thing again. This is dreadfully boring and time consuming. Gone is also the doctor/patient healing system in which you only could bandage your soldiers in tactical view, and then had to use a doctor to heal them up in strategic view.  Instead you now fully heal your soldiers in 5 secs when using heal kits in tactical view, without any kind of debuff. And as your characters donÂ´t die instantly when getting to 0 hp (the fall down, and you have a good amount of time to heal them before the die)  you can often just run straight at the enemy using no tactics whatsoever. This takes away all the realism that helped make Jagged Alliance 2 so good, and makes for a really boring game.If you want to play a tactical squad based game, go play Jagged Alliance 2 or good old X-com (or wait for the remake from Fireaxis). Or if you do not like turn-based games, go play Fallout Tactics, which lets you chose if you want to play real time or turn-based. Do not buy Jagged Alliance: Back in Action, you will be disappointed! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

a shadow of its former self .The game lacks alot of things 1)F.O.W 2)stealth (when you are outside a building the enemies always looking at your position) 3)ambidexterity (no merc can use 2 pistols at once or 2 knives 4)no action button (open,close door etc)4)items cannot be seing (you must be very carefully where the items drop) 5)cabinets and such are only fixed (you cant use any drawer or any cabinet) 6)weapon attachments are out of reality (i managed to attach a 10x telescope to a machinegun !!!!!? + tha only 1 attachment can be attach) 7)only the medics can heal you cant even try to do it 8)the positions of your mercs are fixed and many many moreresult = Its a good try BUT there is no connection to the REAL jagged alliance 2 ...too bad i had many hopes !!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't really give this above a 5 right now.  The User Interface is awkward and counter-intuitive.  Moving the camera around involves holding down the alt-key. Cameras are a semi-standardized part of gaming- I'm not sure why they chose to go with something that didn't work over something established that does work.  I haven't seen a way to click on an enemy and have my character move towards it and fire.  It seems like you have to first move your character into range, and when it's just right, they'll start firing.  There may be a way to do this, but even if there is, it isn't adequately explained.  There are also a number of bugs and little annoyances.  Like when you recruit people, you have to wait for this sequence of a sound of a modem connecting to finish before actually recruiting someone. Even when you first start the game there are a ton of logos you have to click escape from, etc.  I bought this game because I like the concept, and some people gave it positive reviews- so I had hoped the main version would be better than the demo.  I knowingly took a risk, and, so far anyway, it wasn't worth taking.  In fact, if I can return this game (bought it less than 24 hours ago), then I intend to.  Somebody said this was a rough diamond, and I agree, but I would emphasize the word rough.  Until there is a patch out to *really* fix all the bugs and annoyances, my rating will be at a 2, because for $40.00 I expect a hell of a lot better than what I got.

Reading the reviews further helps lock in that they spent more on advertising than they did on the actual game.AI is atrocious. Often times you will give orders and sit and curse while your soldiers decide not to shoot. They badly needed testers to play through the game a few times before publishing. You can immediately see all enemy soldiers every mission. This makes stealth completely ridiculous as you can simply wait for the enemy soldier to randomly look the other way before having your character round the corner and knife them in the back. This game rips off Jagged Alliance 2, but strips down all the flavor that makes the game fun. Lets hope fans can try to crack the game and mod it to make it playable.If this game weren't in any way related to the Jagged Alliance franchise I think I would not have the issues I have. The graphical engine isn't terrible and I think that with a another year and some passion about the original game they could have made this into something fun. I also question the amount of money that went into advertising this release and into the good reviews I've been reading that appear to be out of touch with the individuals who actually played the game.Before buying this game, go buy Silent Storm. It's graphics are still superior and they actually took the time to flesh the game out. Oh it's also 8 years old.

Pas de tour par tour pour ce nouveau Jagged Alliance mais un temps réel avec pause... qui n'est pas au point. Pourtant ça devrait fonctionner vu qu'on peut même enchaîner les actions dans une file d'attente comme bien des jeux de rôle utilisant ce système de combat. Durant la pause, on peut voir également les cônes de vision des ennemis comme dans un vieux Metal Gear sauf qu'ici les cônes sont à 180° dans un souci de réalisme (on suppose).

Réalisme... Fallout Tactics en avait aussi mais il proposait une interface proche de la perfection. Or, c'est loin d'être le cas ici. L'inventaire est spécifique à chaque personnage et devient rapidement un beau merdier avec ses petites cases à la mords-moi-le-noeud. Et pas moyen de changer les raccourcis des contrôles, on ne peut rien configurer. Mais le gros problème c'est le niveau très élevé des ennemis dès le début du jeu qui met un peu plus en exergue la nullité de ses mercenaires à soi (3 au maximum avec l'argent qu'on a), lents, idiots, avec des gilets pare-balles en papier et qui ne savent pas viser.

Avec des ennemis nombreux qui patrouillent et qui ont un champ de vision de 180° et qui parfois vous détectent au delà (!), l'infiltration est quasi impossible et dès qu'on affronte plus d'un ennemi, on se fait laminer en 2 balles et 3 mouvements. Pas de système de couverture, environnements très ouverts, nulle part où se cacher. Le jeu est très agréable graphiquement certes, mais au bout de quelques heures à neutraliser un par un les vilains sans se faire répérer à 400 m, on commence à se faire chier avec ces tanches de mercenaires dont l'expérience évolue très (trop) lentement.

A ce rythme, on mettra 200h à reconquérir l'île : non, la vie est trop courte pour se faire chier avec un jeu de merde. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main problem is how buggy and clunky this game is. The multiplayer doesn't seem to work at all, whether private or public, and the developers don't seem to care. On the forums they give helpful advice such as "it worked when *we* tested it". I understand from the simulations what's trying to be accomplished here, but this sort of game is entirely about the experience, and there's simply nothing to do. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst Larry game ever made. If you have enjoyed a Larry game in the past, do NOT get this game. It is not an adventure game, it is just full of annoying mini-games, that require little skill. This game gets a 2 from me, 1 for each big breast of the girls in the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is at best an indie game, the release does not warrant a full game or the hefty price. Some might call it a Mario kart clone but it is void of the charm and character you get in a Nintendo game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Two because I can't play the game. It's awfully optimized. I'm getting 10 FPS at low settings and reduced resolution, when I can play BF3 at medium and full resolution. Absolutely unacceptable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My short summary: Fun for about an hour, and then its all the same, over and over just in different buildings. No idea how people can give this 8-10/10. Unbelievable how low standards people have today. I guess they either vote after they played for 5 minutes and think the game is going to be that fun for many hours (wrong), or they vote on graphics alone. Sad, very sad. 2/10 for a fun start, but it needs to be fun for a long time to be a game of caliber. I have games that are fun for years for cryin out loud.

Developers today have gone bonkers. Make good graphics, show it off in a cool trailer, take as much pre-order money as possible and finally disapoint the gamers. Sure, the headshots were fun for a little while at least... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This "Game" is generic as all hell. There is nothing special about it what so ever, and it brings nothing new to the table. If any of you remember on the original Xbox, there was this disappointing game by the name of Brute Force. Fuse is basically a next gen rehash of that game. The characters even match up, with one girl Izzy (Flint) being good with snipers, the other girl Naya (Hawk)having the cloak ability, and The generic gun slinging muscle head.Not only did this game borrow a formula from a game that failed, it also looks like something that should have been made in 2006 as an Xbox 360 launch title, and that's being generous.The graphics are so bland and outdated that it's not even worth mentioning to be honest, and each level is EXACTLY the same, with minor variations.You scale a cliff, You touch down and stealthy kill a few guards until you are spotted, you open a door or gate that requires two people, you fight a tediously long Robot boss battle, and flee the scene. The characters are forgettable and uninteresting, and the story is very boring and tiresome. The only good thing about this game is the split screen co-op  but that's pretty much it, if you play alone, the team A.I is as dumb as a box rocks, and you constantly have to baby sit them. Give it 2-3 weeks and the price will surely drop down, or rent it and play with some friends, or just don't waste your time at all. Generic to the T is what this game strives to be 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In no way innovating whatsoever. If you want to play a game that was over hyped and had a better alpha known as "Overstrike" then this is your game. If you hate games with idiotic artificial intelligence and generic gameplay with no difference from anything you've played in the past ten years then by all means avoid at any costs.

2 out of 10

This game is great in concept, and poor in implementation. I have played 3 games now, trying to work out various strategies and can say this:
1)	This appears to be based on some designers idea of how politics work. Choices you make may or may not do what you think they do, and there is no information denoting what the overall effect might be. I don’t need the game to let me min/max, but I would like to at least understand who supports various initiatives, and what they are likely to vote for. It feels like there is some formula, but it is very unclear what that is. This makes every decision very frustrating.
2)	When information is presented, it is done in an awkward and confusing manner. For example there are lots of stats about each district available, but none of them cover “what does this district need?” or “How do I address problem X?” So even when there is info available, it is still frustrating just trying to make sense of it.
3)	The engine designer must have done the UI also because the way things like bonuses are presented is horrible. “Sales Bonus! Demand -10%!”. Even if the engine calculated a bonus as -10% for something, why in the world would you present it like that. Its just backwards.
4)	Citizen desires, which they call The Wheel of Life are presented as offsets to the current era target. So you have a hard time understanding how much better you need to make things. They should just show it as “11/15” instead of “-4”. Even then, once you learn to understand what it means, how to solve that issue is unclear.
As I said, this game could be really good and after playing it a few times I can see where they were going with it. But the developer just did a very bad job of putting it into action in a way that makes sense to most people. Sure you can learn how to read their numbers, but I should have to work at learning the strategy, NOT at figuring out how to read their statistics.
This is a $10 game with more polish than you would expect from that price range and a big publisher. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While the premise is fun for kids, the controls are not. I bought this for my 5 year old, who is new to gaming, upon the reccommendation of a game store employee. He loves cooking on Webkinz World so I thought he'd enjoy it. I played it first to show him how it's done and I knew right away there would be problems. The controls are not intuitive as one would imagine. The timer for each "event" is way too short to allow for a chance to get used to the controls. After scoring a 0 on his first recipe my son never wants to play again. Even the mini-games, which I thought he'd enjoy, are too difficult for a young child. I should have stuck with Wii Sports! Finally, Mama's austrian/asian accented voice and the flames that come from her eyes when you do poorly (even though she says "it's okay, Mama will help") are waaaaaay too creepy. This game is too hard for young players and too boring for anyone old enough to play it properly. I'm sure there's a niche market of cooking interested 8 year olds who enjoy it greatly, but for everyone else it's a huge waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh, where to begin. If you are considering buying this game for more than two bucks at a garage sale or bargain bin, put it back and step away. The cheesy Asian engrish voice-overs (and this one will reinforce every lame stereotype out there) are worth the laugh, but the game gets frustrating fast. Controls are totally anti-intuitive and frustrating, instructions (written and on-screen) can charitably be described as "poor", and the complete-epic-fail-ishness of it stops being amusing pretty quickly. Too bad - could have been an pretty entertaining family game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible. I give it a 2 instead of 0 because it is a complete game without any bugs and it has a professional apperance. Everything else about this game is boring as hell: the shooting, the enemies, the rooms, the objectives. I have played at least 10 indie games on steam, this one was pretty terrible considering the cost. If you have any reservations about buy this game just pass on it cuz the odds are pretty high that you will be let down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I saw this on a Steam sale, and it was really cheap. So, I didn't do what I normally do, which is check the metacritic. Big Mistake. Turns out this is little more than a UI for paying money. I had thought the idea cool, and was enjoying it -- until I saw "buy more gold". I had a sinking feeling in my gut. I clicked on it and.. yes, there it is. $10 to buy gold.

So, I recommend buying this game if you want to have a pixelleted away of spending money for no good reason. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The problem with Knights of Pen & Paper +1 edition isn't microtransactions, as mentioned by reviewer Type4101, since the implementation of being able to buy extra stuff in-game is purely, purely optional, and in no way does the game ever force you or make you feel you need to part with your cash to progress within the game.

However, the inclusion of a store is puzzling considering how little affect it has. God forbid the type of player that would buy stuff in-game, I can't begin to imagine the sort that would. Regardless, the developers must have been a tad bit overzealous to include such a thing knowing that they would receive little to none income from it. This was a mistake on their part; from a marketing and design viewpoint.

But enough of that, as I said already, the microtransactions within the game are pointless. As I said earlier; the problem isn't this. The real problem is the game not taking itself serious for a PC platform.

This game was originally designed as a mobile app/tablet game. It suits that environment very well as a quickplay sort of game.. However, marketing for the PC is a different ballgame altogether and the dev's have utterly failed in their quest to win the hearts of PC gamers, as evident by majority of reviews.

The 1+ edition has alwasy been marketed as a pen & paper rpg for pen & paper fans; and here lies the problem. Despite all the hype, the 1+ edition is little more than a few bells and whistles attatched onto the original game and brings no real changes to the PC nor does it in anyway entice P&P players (like myself) to buy this game (reviewing this game based on a copy I played on a friends PC, and no I didn't pirate it!).

The game features crammy hammy dialogue that for one, isn't remotely funny, nor is it common enough to even earn the hype that this game has been given for the suppose banter that takes place. Hardly any banter takes place between your fellow NPC players, and when it does take place its over in a second and you could hardly call it banter. This would be my main complaint about the game, the lack of any real comedy value (and not the *overly slapstick can't take myself seriously enough comedy*) or banter between any of the npcs or any meaningful quests creates an incredibly repetitive dull experience that only the most blinded faithful consumers could love.

The only positive thing I can say about this game, which isn't much, is the pixel art and backgrounds. They are a joy to behold, but sadly a game doesn't win on just art alone. The game is surely lacking in a lot of area's including customisation in which there hardly is any. Want to name a NPC at your table? Well, you can't! Want to create your own? Well, you can't!

Enough. If you want a dull repetitive experience; buy the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst game on PS2 I've ever played and the worst wave/ski game ever. The graphics, sound, and presentation are good, but the controls are awful and the physics don't make sense. Both in freestyle and racing, this game is almost unplayable. I couldn't seem to do a trick. Even though its sort of arcade style, you won't have fun with this. I think Kawasaki and Eidos wish they had never made this. Get Rides Gone Wild or WaveRace 64 instead. I can't believe how disappointing Wave Rally is. If they had made this on PS1 or N64 I'd still give it 2 stars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holy crap did I accidentally fire up my playstation? Is this game really on my 360? Some of the worst graphics I've seen on the 360 in a long time....what a peice of crap, glad I only rented this heap. Even at that it was a waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very poor game play and handling, very buggy, crashed several times. Worst game I have played in a long time, a very long time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, I was in the market for a good Dragon game. That is, a game where you play as a dragon. Anyway, I had heard of this game via internet and I got it for Christmas. I was so exited when I booted it into my xbox! How disappointed was I when I saw how the graphics were nothing but grainy textures. There were no tutorials for much of anything, as I quickly found I could not find out how to map anything to anything. And the difficulty, oooh the difficulty. This game is best played by those who enjoy endless grinding. Even on easy mode, I found it hard to keep up with even the most basic mobs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To be completely honest, this game shouldnt really go under the banner of a RPG, unless you class picking up rings and equipping them as an "action" rpg.

Before you commence be ready for plenty of dying for the dumbest of reasons (falling from a small ledge, walking into water etc), and having to start from the beginning over and over, a dire combat system, awkward controls, average music. If you can see past these points and want to finish the game, it takes about 7-8 hours to complete.

I actually purchased this game within 6 months of it's release, I played it non-stop for a few days until it was completed, and it has been gathering dust ever since, so no replay value for me. Even in 2002 the graphics could only be described as blocky, so imagine how they compare with current standards.

Definitely one to avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am writing this review as a warning to others in my situation. I bought the retail version of this game for my kids and I to enjoy splitscreen.  The only person who can use all the characters is the one using my profile, the rest can only use half the characters, and in my mind, half the game.  The licensed characters can only be used by one person at a time.  We have enjoyed the game and find it a family friendly bit of third person shooter and light strategy.   I enjoy games with my family members, in the same room, and will do so until gaming becomes a strictly online affair.  I went to Ubisoft's website and read that the last four armies on the disk are tied to one profile and cannot be shared.  WHO DO THEY THINK THE TARGET AUDIENCE IS FOR THIS?  So if you are purchasing for the same purpose as I was, be warned hat neither sub accounts, or logging in as guest will make the characters playable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very excited with this one. Wow, a life manager with a science fiction theme? A social network in a space station?  Great idea!

But Very Disappointing. A good looking game that  results in a poor game play experience. Lots of things on the screen that makes you think "wow, this will be amazing, micromanagement and that kind of cool stuff". But no. All those buttons and panels you can see in the screen shots are not really for play, just to look better. There are a very little few to do while "playing". Is the game itself who plays, not you. It  shows a lot of info, menus and "star trek computer looking" window screens  but  you really don't have any option. Just keep pushing the "next" button.

Money wasted. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is terrible.  Please ignore the majority of these positive reviews, most are written by people who created an account, reviewed this game immediately and  then never did anything else. Sketchy  A perfect ten with a review that is basically a commercial listing features  Yeah ok nice try.

Anyway, I really wanted to like this game but other than the graphics theres nothing original or even worth mentioning. The combat is a step below flash games, the sound is nothing  write home about and its just SO incredibly tedious and boring.  Honestly the critics were gentle with this game.  Avoid at all cost. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It looks right. But with just ONE control, how can you screw that up? The arcade game was not sluggish like this. It looks accurate, and if you were able to play more easily, it would play accurately. But again, how do you not get the controller right? There aren't even buttons on this game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Possibly the worst MMO I ever played. Absolutely beautiful graphics I'll give you that, but everything else was terrible. Especially the community, and the community is what makes an MMO. All the cool "espoinage and pvp politics" that people keep talking about don't really amount to much if you haven't been playing for 2+ years. There is a serious gap between the "upper class" and the "noobies". Also the economy in the game is possibly the imbalanced of any MMO on the market. I love the idea of being able to create clans and alliances that reshape the land and effect the economy in an almost entirely player driven world, but in order for that to be successful the players must be outgoing and inviting. Instead you have maybe 200 people on every server that basically control everything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The thing that made me not give it a 1 was its Career mode. Besides that it sucked especially the graphics. I thought I was playing a Playstation 1 game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This one hasn't aged well. An interesting choice for an HD remake. Creaking under clunky animation is a bland, uninspiring reminder of how far along games have come.

As far as 3D platformers go, you can do alot better than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is TERRIBLE! I am a huge fan of the show, and aside from the cut scenes' good presentation, this is a joke. The mini games are laughable, and the choppy framerate and poor controls aren't even good enough to be a beta, let alone a final release. The story is also really shallow, almost as if someone said "Here is an outline of our story" and they just used that as the main plot. [***SPOILERS***] This game does such a terrible job of bridging seasons 2 and 3 together as well. You'd think they would mention a bunch of terrorists invading ctu and michelle wasting all of them in season 3. Or, if Jack got Kim the job at CTU because he wanted her safe, I don't think she'd still be working there after she gets kidnapped on her first day. Also, there's a bug on mission 11 where if you fail (the part right after the sniping part), it restarts you with only 1 enemy to fight and the rest never show up. So you can't advance in the game. Since it auto saves, you're stuck here forever and have to go back and play the whole game over again. The only reason this gets a 2 is because of the unintentional humor of running around yelling "CTU!" "Federal Agent!" while handcuffing all of your co workers, civilians, enemies and swat team members, then punching them in the face with no reprocussions. Also, it is really funny when you get hit by a car. It's like the physics get turned off and you go flying into the air doing a series of backflips and twists that only a dead person with no skeleton could emulate. Only rent for the above mentioned unintentional humor, and nothing else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most definite example of the downfall of crowd-funding.    It is full of great ideas but executed -very- poorly.    It lags like hell and crashes to the desktop like every minute. It has serious connection problems but has no off-line mode. And that without save functionality.

Gamewise, strategic depth is too shallow. The variety of fations or units are extremely limited. AI is stupid. Pathfinding is way too primitive.

All in all. It is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too far from finished.

And they are already preparing another game on the kickstarter. What?
It is quite unethical of them.
Don't buy this s*t. It's not worth your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a steaming pos. First, they sell it at a ludicrous price screwing over their fans withotut very deep wallet. Second they promise tons of features, but they do not complete most of them leaving their game very shallow. Now they claimed they have finished it and moved on to another game, ignoring what they have promised. Third, their game still has massive technicual issues and poor performance. Fourth, gameplay itself is shallow and the only innovation is the idea of battles being held in a few planets at once. This sounds interesting but is executed very badly, there is no difference between planets so each one is the same flat, boring arena for the spam fest that PA is. It was certainly a promising title that seemingly was too much for the devs to handle.
With the devs being that greedy and incompotent I have to give it a 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Uber has advertised us with soo many features, the game is full of bugs, game balance is awfull, many units useless.... the earth of the game is not good. Total Annihilation although being old is a better game. Supreme commander is also a far better pick. This game is dead and will never reach the promised goal. Uber is placing a new funding ... for a new game .. lol.. are you kidding ? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pure disappointment, wasted potential, and another massive knock against crowd funding. I can only recommend that any truly interested watch many, many ,many hours of CURRENT gameplay video. Then beat there smurfin faces with there keyboard to knock some good god damn sense back into themselves before taking a bite out of this big, steaming, **** sammich. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Did you grow up playing Total Annihilation?  Did you rekindle this love with Supreme Commander and its excellent expansion Forged Alliance?  Only to be sorely disappointed by the lackluster Supreme Commander 2?

Did you follow the Uber kickstarter?  Did you watch the cool trailer and have those warm fuzzing TA/SC feelings all over again?

Then you can experience the same heartbreak I did with this terrible game!  I bought it for $80 and for my money it's not worth the $6 it's on sale for now.  Lack of unit diversity, tech, boring terrain, the list goes on...   something is wrong over at Uber, this thing was mismanaged into the ground after being funded EXTREMELY well on Kickstarter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is bad, real bad.

The good:
Massive scale
fast paced rts
simple to play

the bad:
Super imbalanced, It's like the devs spent exactly 0 seconds balancing this game...
More than half of the units are useless
Titans and god weapons are so absurd OP
AI is awful
pathing is worse than most games made 20 years ago

I don't know... it's just a bad game.  I'm happy that they delivered on creating something and I would recommend this for LAN games against HUMANS only.  I would also set some verbal rules like (don't create any titans, don't create second level artillery) because all of this is SOOOOO game breaking imbalanced.

Seriously don't buy this game unless you're playing at LAN party :). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst DRM since SimCity (always online to play single player vs AI), game ending lag within that online experience, constant crashing,inability to field large armies (lag again), failure to meet kickstarte promises (missing units, DRM) and absolutely no dev communication on why the game was released in such a poor state, or when it will be fixed?

This is simply a failed game at the moment, not worth buying, it's full of bugs and doesn't work. There is a rabid core of fanboys on Uber's forums bigging it up and claiming all this stuff is coming, but as an average consumer, this was a big mistake. Do yourself a favour and avoid, at least until there have been a number of patches and things are fixed (not sure this will ever happen). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game promised much, but the end result is far from the promises. It is far from the quality levels of Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander series. This game lacks manual, has no tutorial, no ability to save games, very limited in many aspects of gameplay, and in others points is unfriendly, several flaws in the AI, naval units are useless, the whole control system the planet is chaotic, the transport system between planets is very bad, the two factions in the game are the same (structures and units are the same). PA is not a good strategy game, or even add something really new to the world of gaming, as something similar, but without planets, it did years ago a game called Metal Fatigue. In PA, the planets are just maps, and very small, it is an arcade game, compared to the Supreme Commander is an insult to the strategy, and the game of Chris Taylor. All this, without going into depth on how bad it is optimized and tested with crashes or errors of any kind, especially for a game in 2014.
Today, it is impossible to recommend to anyone to buy this game. Let no one be fooled, because they say that the game follows the steps of Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander, because that is a lie by 90%. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The presentation simply did not meet the expectation nor the goal set out by the developer in Kickstarter.

Game content:
Single player is non-existent, without storyline, PA only has the galactic conquer mode is just skirmish games with minimal alterations(with certain units/buildings locked until you equip it in the meta-game map.)
Units and technology is very basic. I've counted more units in the old classic , Total Annihilation, which is a 1997 game for god's sake.
The space part of the game is also underwhelming, with only 3 buildings, and 7 units. (These are, builder, scout, adv scout, fighter, transport,bomber, turrets, 2 types of resource generators, and finally the factory)
It's basically a water-down version of a new dimension like air, or naval, with less units!
Ground based orbital defenses , unit-firing cannon (showcased in the pledge of Kickstarter), or more orbital combat units than 2 of the fighter/bomber is nowhere to be found.

Stability:
Game crashes.
Server crashes.
Other player crashes.

Combine all three of the above, with the fact that the game has to log-in to play, you'll get a very frustrating experience where you can't play single players when the server is down, and when you want to play multi-player (and the server is actually up and running!) chances are someone will crash mid-game.

Other thoughts:
I understand this is a small-production studio trying to re-create a classic RTS game with new ideas, but overall even when that is taken into consideration it's still disappointing.
The fact that the game was unstable, and simply has not met the goals set out by kickstarter when they officially released it a month ago was disappointing(not to mention how they rip people for $100 with the even more unstable version during Alpha)
But today when I received an email from the developer about their new kickstarter project it's simply heartbreaking - It meant they'll be shifting their focus onto the new project. Updates to PA will be limited to say the least. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some things that make this game completely uninteresting to me:

- I don't like playing on a sphere.  They should have axed that idea at the beginning.  TA and SC have "flat" maps and it works well!!  Tried too hard to be different.
- Units are too cartoonish.  Seems more like a tablet game with respect to unit graphics detail.
- Unit tiers are bare bones.
- Bugs and overall lack of a finished game feel.
- DRM.

With the all-star team, I expected a much better game.  I would have been thrilled with just an update to Total Annihilation, with new units, maps, and use of modern graphics card features.  Anyway, I don't see myself ever playing this game.  At least I have a cool t-shirt coming this "winter" for my $120!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games ive ever seen in my life. graphics are horrible and the so called violence is blurred out. the blood looks fake and the story sucks. I wouldn't pay for it. in fact, i would pay to not play it! it is a dissapointment to the wii. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The animation and interaction are astounding at first, you feel like the badass that you are, for about an hour. Eventually it gets to the point, ok shoot shoot shoot, he ducks, curve bullet, dead. Rinse and repeat. I dont mean shoot shoot get hit and hide then do it, no, u can literally stand there and just shoot the whole game with minimal cover. The exceptions are the sniper missions, which are marginally more interesting. I ended up just trying to get the gamerscore long before I finished the story mode. Definitely a decent rent if you are the kind of person that likes to play a game for an hour then not play for the rest of the day. This game is like going for a run, you think awesome, Im really doing it at first while you flip around n shoot stuff, but after a while your like why the **** am I doing this? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Inferior to Shattered Dimensions in every way. GRAPHICS: noticeably worse than Shattered Dimensions, but still good for a Wii game 6/10. ADVENTURE: The story is good comic book fare. Unfortunately combat feels like grinding (how many times do I have to knock you down?!), the health bar is completely unbalanced lasting forever in some areas then disappearing in 3 hits in the next (no natural regen like SD either), many of the achievements require you knowing what to do before hand (instead of skill), and several opponents are cheeeeeeeaaap (seconds of invincible frames, master marksmen, you name it) 2/10. MECHANICS: Again, a huge step backwards from SD. Wall crawling controls seem random at best, the 2099 falling scenes went from awesome to awful, auto targeting wants you to die, collecting the energy balls is Lame, motion controls vary from hyper sensitive to non-responsive, quick time events also vary from all day to you lose before the motion is even on the screen 1/10. EXTRAS: Did I mention that collecting energy balls is stupid? How about the stripped down upgrades system being weak? The part where you have to know exactly what to do to finish some of the timed sections without retrying again? How about how this game is terrible compared to the last one? That the bosses are few and far between and seem to favor dumb luck over skill or strategies? 1/10! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Look, when a game idea goes just as badly wrong as it just did, it makes me wonder what theese people are thinking other than "Money." Take a look at shattered demensions if you must, but no one will ever , say 'praise' this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of Recetear, but this is just awful. The dialog is great, but the controls are horrendous and you can't modify them. The gameplay itself is pretty dull. It's a simple hack-and-slash but you don't really get a whole lot for killing things. It might be a decent game if the controls weren't so bad.... basically, don't waste your time if you don't have a gamepad handy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really did want to like this game, I bought it off of Gamersgate (one of three indie RPG purchases) and I was sorely dissapointed. The camera was atrocious at times, and while I can enjoy difficulty spikes in RPGs, I expect them to be balanced out and done in a way that seems natural to the game's storyline. This game, unfortunately, does not do this. Instead, you get a game that would all but frustrate the most hardcore RPG gamer out there with its difficulty curve, and the amount of polish that went into this game is laughable. There are some really excellent indie RPGs out there, but sadly, this is not one of them. Not recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Apart from a few minigames, this game is so incredibly boring! And it is also so damn slow, just 1 turn takes several times longer than it should because of all the unnecessary in-game tips you get from the retarded host, who has to explain every minigame in detail over and over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never liked any Mario Party game, and I've played most of 'em. It's got stupid board-game mechanics that make no sense, too-long default game time, and mini-games that are mediocre at best. Played it with 3 friends -- this game's best-case scenario -- and still didn't really have any fun. I honestly can't see how anyone sober and over the age of 6 can enjoy this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game is horrible. I loved it on the gamecube but on the wii its compleate crap. Some of the minigames are fun but the actual boardgame part of it has taken a huge step backwords to the point that its almost not a functioning game. Stick with the gamecube version, the only good games on the wii right now are minigame games, but this isn't one of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is garbage. I know that this is a game for little kids but I played the all the Mario party games and this is one of the worst games out of the series! I remember the good days were the point was to get all the stars you can in twenty turns or twenty-five if you felt ballsy and hope that you are the player that killed Bowser. The game was really  it is just unplayable. I hate this game it deserves nothing less than what I gave it. The music is horrible, the idea for the game taking place at a carnival is just dumb, and the graphics look like garbage. This is horrible and i regret playing this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is so slow. I'm only interested in playing party style games with friends and you have to unlock most of the games by playing single player game first. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A ridiculously horrible game. It is really quite hard to comprehend where nintendo was going with this one. I played this with groups of 3-8 people.........sometimes even using it as a drinking game; the "party" aspect does not redeem the utter lack of strategy. Everything about this game is random. A game based purely on luck gets real old, real fast. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most boring mario game i have ever come accross. I can barely stay awake. I had to double check the box incase it was for under 3 year olds only. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh no, it's ANOTHER Mario Party game. I'd bet $1000 that Nintendo finds a way to stretch this series to Mario Party 15. The mini games would probably include sawing logs and opening cans. Oh wait, they've already done that! I enjoyed the first few Mario Party games, but this is just ridiculous. The fact is, the whole game is based on luck. You could win every stupid mini game and still come in last. If you already have any of the Mario Party games, there is absolutely NO reason to buy this game. Unfortunately, there will always be people willing to buy these games, and will in fact buy Mario Party 9, and Mario Party 10, and Mario Party 11, and Mario Party 12, and Mario Party 13, and Mario Party 14, and finally Mario Party 15, which Nintendo will give some unimaginative new name to, like Mario's Big Bash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's one thing you need to know about Mario Party 8 before you buy it  be prepared to do a lot of reading during the game! The game has an incredibly irritating interface whereby it bombards you with constant information throughout the game which can only be cleared by pressing the A key. Consequently, you spend most of the time repeatedly pressing the A key to get rid of the constant barrage of messages. In fact before the game even starts you are forced to read through an endless parade of information boxes that end up making things more confusing and leaving you wondering when on earth this game is going to start. For a game aimed at kids as well as adults I fail to see how any child would have the patience to read through so much claptrap before the game begins, it really is that tedious.

After reading what seems like a small book worth of instructions, the game finally starts. This is where the next level of frustration begins, as Mario Party 8 is based around you playing a boardgame that is little more than glorified snakes and ladders and has zero skill. Playing a game of luck against a human opponent has some element of short-term fun, but against the computer, forget it. As a single-player game, Mario Party 8 is a non-starter and will bore you witless very, very quickly.

Against a human opponent the boardgames are entertaining for a while and give some genuine laughs but the lack of skill needed soon gets annoying and you find yourself yearning for the mini-games to break up the monotony. But playing a mini-game, like everything else, relies on luck, you have to just hope that a roll of the dice lands you on a square which puts you into a mini-game. When the mini-game starts, your relief from the tedium is often very short-lived as many of the mini-games are over in less than a minute, then it's back to the wretched boardgame again. Another annoying touch to the game is that there are many pre-set animations that you are forced to watch without any option of skipping them, this just adds to the frustration of the game.

But what of the mini-games themselves? Well, many are actually very good, some are horrible, but generally they're good fun and well designed. Unfortunately some mini-games have to be unlocked which can only be achieved by success on the boardgames. So if you're willing to have your patience pushed to the limit it's possible to unlock them, but you'll probably end up deciding another session on the boardgames is too much to bear.

Mario Party 8 is a huge opportunity missed. The idea of loads of simple but fun party games is a good one, but the game design does everything it can to stifle this through the constant stream of pointless information that interrupts the game, and the woeful boardgames. It would have been better to either make the boardgames more skill-based, or just get rid of them completely, and let people just play the mini-games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably one of the worst games I have ever played, and thank god it is so mercifully short.  Twist_of_Cain87 said that he had fallen into comfort with 8-15 hour games...but this game is only 4 hours, and 5 hours long if you're lucky.  Thank god you can turn off the shaky cam, but the annoying effects are still there.  The game looks like a VHS tape that's been copied over too many times, and random grainy streaks of light will pop up all over the screen.  Things like head shots get blurred out with annoying pixelation.  They still have not refined the shooting or cover mechanics...you'll be blind firing most of the time against what seems like 100s of enemies in such cramped environments.  I enjoyed the first Kane and Lynch despite it's flaws...The great locals and situations such as a bank robbery, a prison rescue, and breaking into the side of a sky scarper dressed as a high-rise window cleaner was awesome.  Kane and Lynch 2, however, seems to ditch all of the great things that made Dead Men great.  Taking the awesome places you went to a cramp Shanghai, and the fact that they do not flesh out the characters at all in this game makes it very un-enjoyable.  The most annoying thing for me besides the camera was the down but not out feature. It wouldn't be so annoying if you're cover wasn't blown to smithereens every 2 seconds leaving you vulnerable, nor if you could peek you're head out from cover without being immediately downed.  If you like blind firing from cover and an eye-sore of a camera for an entire game, well I guess you'd enjoy it.  If not, don't even give this I rent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, I'm in beginning of the game. I'm chasing this guy. I'm running after him, he stops, I continue to run and have nowhere to go. He's staring at me. I try to shoot him. Nope. So, I go on. The game is glitched. We're in 2010. This isn't supposed to happen. Enough said. Also, the game is boring. Story-less. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

By all means skip this game rented it last week and was as disappointed as i was when i played the first one there's to many problems to list so i will just list my main one.  the Fing guns don't hit **** its like the guy you are controlling arm is made out of spaghetti.  I shot 90 bullets from an uzi from 10 feet at a guy to only land 3 bullets i mean come on whats the point just broken.  the game is crap so just skip it your not missing anything 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this is the kinda game that you wait a few months (hell even a year) for the price to come down, at least by that time the game will have patches and updates to fix all its down falls and actually be worth the 20$ you pay for it....maybe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is fun at start but is overwhelmingly difficult and even more frustrating to play. 50% of the time the voice commands aren't recognized and the pinball doesn't follow proper physics trajectories, I would know, I take high level physics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rushed and half Broken. Having played SilentHunter3 (a good but very mixed experience), I waited till 2013 to get SH5 for £4, hoping most of the flaws had been ironed out. No luck. I really wanted to like this game, but even with all patches and some mods, its still a mess. It takes forever to load, the interface is bad, the graphics are not as good as the trailers suggest, It is too arcade (no matter the difficulty setting), the music and voice acting is bad, and the Uplay DRM is still horrible (but it does have a half-baked offline mode). As of May 2013 there is still no decent fix-all super-mod out there. AVOID! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This really really sucks. this review makes me look like a negative nancy but im just seein alot of crappy games lately peace out. yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeahhhhhhhhhhhhh bros 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Someone please make a patch so SH3 can be played on the new Windows!  Or, better yet, plug in the SH5 Graphics into the SH3 engine!!!  Because SH5 is SOOOOooo boring.  Sooooooo system demanding...when it doesn't need to be (my system should hack it with no problem but this game is sticky).  and, finally the game is unfinished.  Not to mention the worst....you have to be online to play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish someone would create a game as good as Crimson Skies about WWI fighter pilots. Wings of War ain't it. The game is fun for about 5 minutes, then becomes drearily repetitive. It's graphically clumsy. The AI is rough. The music is flat. This game kept asking me to feed it quarters. I wish somebody would make a darker Crimson Skies about WW1 dogfighting with that game's same great graphics and addictive gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible animations, linear levels, bad physics engine, no enemy ai to speak of whatsoever...somewhat nice looking levels graphicswise ie, ruined streets, abandoned buildings, etc. Avoid - nothing worth spending time on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game isn't free. It's like free demo, you must play money for everything, i dont know gae that is F2P and u need to pay for levels, only WoW has something like NFS:World, in WoW u can play to 20 lvls for free, but WoW is still P2P. Graphics is ugly, and u must pay for everything... I don't recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I learned of this racing MMO game I was wondering how the resolved the latency problem - I mean, racing cars requires very quick and precise reaction. Well guess what - they didn't. The cars are jerky and the cars are jumping all around. Both the player's and the other player's. I selected manual transmission and got some retarded hybrid that shifts from the buttons but if I don't shift manually shifts automagically anyway.
And my internet connection isn't slow or laggy, I played many other mmos alright.

I played it for 5 min and it was just for a good laugh at what a dumb idea it was to make an MMO out of a racing game.

In all honesty, the graphics are kind of nice.

Oh and $150'000 for a Mitsubishi Eclipse? Really? ;-) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game appears to be fun at first, but after awhile you start to feel the problems with it. The net code for multi-player games is horrid, cars will zip all over the road often ramming you to bits. Sometimes they will disappear entirely only to reappear a few seconds later as they zip by you at a 1,000 miles an hour and give you a whack on there way back to where they should be if they hadn't disappeared.The customization is average at best, there are pretty basic performance parts for the cars you can buy, and you have a chance to win better ones from the card system at the end of races. Other than the parts you cant customize your cars performance really at all. Also the numbers that supposedly rate your cars stats (Acceleration, Top Speed, Handling) are utter bogus randomly useless numbers. They have no meaning when compared to any other car from what i was able to see.The graphics are pretty good, but not amazing. There is NO WAY to rebind keys, or setup game-pad/Driving Wheels to be used with the game aside from the ones that are listed on there website.The pursuit portion of the game is OK, its nothing new, and not any better than previous NFS games.They constantly push the "Speedboost" in-game currency you pay real money for to get an edge up. If you really enjoy the game it would be worth it for the Rep/Money multipliers, otherwise I cant justify giving away money for game in such a poor state.In closing it seems like its only about 1/3 of a game, like its a early beta test; sadly its been live for about 7 months. Still needs a lot of work, but all they are interested in doing is creating more things to spend the "Speedboost" currency's on. The best feature of Need for Speed World: it's technically free... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved Bomber man as a kid so I was excited to pick this up, despite the $40 price tag and against my better judgment I decided to get it. After about ten minutes I immediately regretted this purchase. Way overpriced, excruciating story, and an AI that plays flawlessly. Wish I could get my money back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Annoying voice acting, horrible boss design, bad controls, and dead multiplayer. Oh and it's 50$ avoid at all costs. Only reason I gave it a 2 is because it can be tolerable with friends. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Muito ruim 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Family Guy Back to the Multiverse
LEGO Marvel Superheroes
The Amazing Spider-Man 2
Take those 3 amazing games and take away their comedy, fun gameplay, and story, and you get s**t like this 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst game ever... The first developers went bankrupt, so the game has gone through many hands. the main reason this game sucks is..... WHERE IN THE HELL ARE THE HONDAS!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1. Why should you ruin and implement x-ray vision into a game like this?
2. With the whistle u can kill everyone piece by piece with nobody to notice
3. Playable and fun maybe between ages of 3-12
4. Everything is much to easy, all the tasks are similar.
5. I hate the help icons that appear all around the game, i hate the AI( he is so stupid), i hate x-ray, i hate this game and i am sorry that i bought it.

Graphics not bad, but i cant play a game just because it looks good
Cheers! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am writing this review based on what little time I have played the game (on what little time the game has allowed me to play since it came out).

I will start with the Cons:
1. No mouse or keyboard proper rebinding. You CAN rebind to any key you want, but the keys may not work at all, especially if you rebind using the right side keyboard and mouse buttons, actions will NOT work anymore, and you will be forced to use the wasd scheme. Not good for Disabled gamers. or gamers used to playing on the right side of keyboard, or using different mouse keys.
2. Extra mouse buttons are not seen, nor are they mappable.
3. There are 4 different FOV's in this game, and they are all different, and they change about every minute to 2 minutes. Fine if you are 15 feet from a tv, not good when you are a foot from a Monitor.
4. The game is worse than Max Payne 3 or the worst Tomb Raider at taking control away from the player.
5. On monster rigs, even with their so called fps patch, the game is still limited to 62 fps, on 144hz monitors.
6. NO FOV slider, ini, cfg, anything to change the fov. Get ready for headaches and migraines.
7. Graphics are as dated as 2003-2004. Only the cut scenes look good. But, even the cut scenes have doubling in them, like the AA is off, or maybe its the blur they put in.
8. Shooting has no weight, or feel to it. It feels like an old arcade shooter from the 80's.
9. Driving feels like they took it from the game Driver: San Francisco. Feels more like drift car than even most drift car games.
10.
11. Shadows from clouds. They follow you indoors, as well as ABRUPTLY cutting off one inch one way or the other.
12. Shadows. You are either in pitch black, or you are in hallogen lighting. The in-game lighting cannot be adjusted correctly, its either one or the other.

Pro's:
1. The muscle car you drive looks nice.
2. The narrator is excellently voiced.
3. I will have to get back to you anything else good, as so far there isnt anything else I think is good.

TL:DR
Do NOT buy this game, as it is incomplete at this time. Even console players are complaining about serious bugs in the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My older rig (PhenomII x6 1090T + 16GB DDR3 + GTX 960) couldn't run this game as it needs SSE4.x Instruction set for some reason which my Processor Lacks . So I had to play this on a Friends PC.

1. Graphics : Terrible Terrible graphics - All I see is low res textures with washed out colors and a horrible yellow filter .

FC2 had this color filter too - but at least it didn't look like a blurry mess like this one . This game has 10 GBs of movies and ~6 GBs of audio + 15 Gb laguage packs. . Everything else goes to models, animation and textures. So one can guess, why the game is so blurry and why it can’t be fixed by any patch. They simply made it with year 2000 textures. Most of them do not exceed 512×512 pixels in resolution. Meh.

2. AI - Non Existent .
3. Repetitive ? - yes , but i didn't mind it.
4. Combat - Satisfying , not challenging at all - but GOOD.
5.  Story - Good .
6. Vehicle control - easy , mafia 2 had harder controls .
7. Optimization : Really really poor - A game that looks this bad with such a terrible AI should not demand this kinda resource.

Question to the Devs - why do you need SSE4.x instruction set for this dogs**t?

Current state of game : unfinished .

AAA games these days ......;..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a complete desaster in everything.

- Overall graphic even in highest settings still looks blurred.
- Game physics feels like first console games out of the nineties.
- Nobody can identify with such dumb looking character.
- A bad and poor imitation of the Assassins Creed series

My final quote:

2 Points for this Game.

1 for the music and 1 point for the deinstallation routine.

Both worked perfect for me.

Thanks to the devs and publishers for being completely foolish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poorly optimized even on strong PC's. outdated graphics engine.Relatively interesting story...for the first hour then its the same repetitive. go kill this guy. go kill that guy. No original ideas and i was bored after about 3 hours. Very poor game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This does not feel like a Mafia game at all, its far from it. I stopped playing the game after I got bored of it, also got tired of some of the bugs in the game and the extremely bad AI.

Mafia 3 reminds me of other bad or mediocre games. For some reason they have put alot of time into graphics (which sucks by the way) and not to much into game-play. You're doing much of the same over and over and over again. All the missions are the same, or follows the same pattern.

Also, I don't understand how the system requirement can be so high, when graphics in other games looks better or similar and require much less HW.

I liked the cut scenes and some of the story, therefore I gave it a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mafia III is not only UGLY (especially on PC, since the differences between the low and high settings are barely visible) it's also quite boring and repetitive. There's absolutely nothing new about this gameplay, you played it a million times before.

The missions structure reminds me a lot of Assassin's Creed Syndicate: do a couple missions in this assigned area, unlock the area's boss, kill the boss, conquer the area. Rinse and repeat. FOREVER!!!
Mafia III plays exactly the same. It's not new, it's not fresh and it's not fun.

And don't get me started on bugs and gameplay issues. This game is definitely not on release state.

The developers do try something different and new with the narrative: the documentary style to tell the story is quite new and enjoyable to watch, but the game has so many flaws, is so god-awfuly repetitive and feels so old that I just can care enough about the story.

Save your money, Mafia III is not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To say Mafia III is a disappointment is an understatement. It has all of the surface components to form a great game: the writing and acting are superb, its direction and style are great, but its mechanical underpinnings are archaic and desperately unimaginative. It’s ironic that Mafia III’s predecessor had a similarly stylish open world, but wasted it by giving players nothing to do besides its main story missions. Mafia III has the opposite problem – tons that you have to do, you just don’t want to do any of it.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TLDR : Bugs , Crashes,  Glitches , Terrible low res textures , Bad yellowish color filter , Too demanding for what it delivers, Non existent optimization . - that's Mafia III  for you . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Plus:
Stunning soundtrack
Excellent physics behavior of vehicles

Minus:
Everything else is a complete failure

I just hate those publishers who repeatedly release an unfinished product 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Моё самое большое разочарование за последние года 3.
Начну с хорошего. В игре нормальный сюжет, прекрасный саундтрек и красивые катсцены. Хах, недолго хорошее длилось. Те самые отлично срежисированные катсцены так хороши, потому что их кот наплакал. Большинство диалогов проходят как в ГТА между тобой и продавцом хот-догов: подошел, нажал Е, смотришь как герои тупо стоят перед друг-другом и разговаривают, изредка двигая руками.
Весь сюжет и атмосфера рушатся бесхитростностью геймплея. Захват района занимает часа полтора и это вам придется провернуть раз 15. Причем затравка всегда одна и та же: ну этот парень рулит районом, но он прячется, пойди вымани его и убей(завербуй). Хоть бы раз я появился на районе и местный босс вылетел бы на меня, как говорится, guns blazing, и мне не пришлось бы снова проворачивать всю эту мутотень. Но нет. Езди по району, ставь прослушку, вали тупых болванчиков пачками, а потом тебя вознаградят 15 минутами более-менее адекватного геймплея и 2-минутной кат-сценой. Повторяйте пока не стошнит.
О, а теперь давайте подробней пройдемся по самому процессу нанесению ущерба мафии. Каждый раз вы будете зачищать одну и ту же локацию минимум два раза. Один раз вы придете туда и кого-нибудь допросите/что-то взорвете/украдете/кого-то убьете, а второй раз вы вернетесь туда же убивать мини-босса. КАЖДЫЙ РАЗ. А иногда приходится и по 3 раза возвращаться, потому как ты не взорвал какой-то там ящик, а больше вариантов нанести ущерб не осталось. Зачищаешь локацию еще разок и бегаешь ищешь, что же ты пропустил.
О, а вам понравились внезапные дополнительные миссии в ГТА, вроде съемки кинозвезд, спонтанных пробежек, спасения схваченной бандюгами девушки? - Забудьте. Вот там стоит грузовик, угоните и перегоните его через всю карту. Повторить еще 15 раз.
Это я молчу про Титановые кусты, которые, черт возьми, тот же грузовик останавливают на полной скорости. Я молчу про волшебные заборы, которые ГГ не может перелезть просто потому что(ГГ вообще много куда не может попасть просто потому что). Я молчу про баги и просто дебильный дизайн уровней из-за которых приходится перезагружать чекпоинты.
В сухом остатке, мы имеем хороших персонажей и неплохой сюжет, отличный саундтрек и на этом все. К сожалению, все это перечеркивается невероятным однообразием и цикличностью геймплея. И пусть Господь даст вам сил выдержать это занудство и скуку, чтоб в тех самых 2-минутных проблесках кат-сцен разглядеть вышеупомянутые плюсы.
НЕ БРАТЬ, ЭТА ИГРА ПОЗОРИЩЕ ЧЕРТОВО. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is locked to 30 fps. And 2k didn't say anything untill the game was released.

Luckily, we have a refund button on steam now. Go ahead and click it ladies and gentlemen 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Una total y absoluta decepción. Destroza el buen recuerdo de Mafia II. Lo único decente de todo el juego es la historia, interesante aunque nada novedosa. Todo lo demás, el juego en sí, sientes que lo has hecho en otros juegos ya sea Red Dead o GTA pero peor y una y otra y otra vez. Ese es su problema: malo y repetitivo hasta la náusea. Gráficamente no destaca, jugablemente no aporta nada, Hangar 13 ha destrozado para siempre una saga genial. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The release of the game and began to make mods for the game so how to play many nasty. 1. This is a graphics-mod as the real graphics are a sweaty mess and look disgusting. 2. To disable a mirror, instrument panel and mini-map on the screen. Players want a realistic look in the game, to make a beautiful video and photos. 3. No saving the car and my garage. No upgrades. car, and much more that was left in great indignation ... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's bad pretty much all across the board (other than the music). Hopefully though, other developers will play it and learn what NOT to do when developing their own games. There is a lot here to learn what not to do. Hangar13? Give it up. Developing games isn't for you. You all should go and find another career. You suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Graphic is not consistent Aaaghhhh **** game.The Gameplay is not good too. And God...... The Skybox Seriously.Even Indie Games have good skyboxes.The Missions are repetitive. The only good thing that i have experienced is driving its better than Mafia 2 which was a marvelous game.I played half way through Mafia 3 and have uninstalled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The user reviews are right, this game is still buggy, the missions are repetitive and poorly designed. Much of the user friendly feature from newer games are not here, there's no fast travel. Most missions do not have check poitns, so you spent 10 mins trying to steathly kill every cop and steal the car, but you get killed by the hit squad when driving the car back. Guess what? You'll get spawned at the quest giver's locaiton, all your work gone, but they somehow remember the ammo and items you use, so not only you wasted time, you also waste money/resource. This is just one of the example of how poorly designed this game is. I can see glimpse of fun here and there, but everytime I start to enjoy the game, something pull me right out. I have not finished the game, this is a review of about 8-10 hours of gameplay. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is truly awful stay away from this monstrosity,if you want to destroy something this game is the best choose,shame on those who created this monster!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

one of the best pixar films is now a nightmare with its horrifying appeal. the levels are much too difficult and the loading times are the worst i've seen in a game. while very few things were fun, everything else was crass concepts. some parts of the game required the collection of items where a level had 40-60 of them and you had to find them all. another horrifying moment was the puzzles in the fish tank requiring more than skill and strategy, but a LOT of free time you won't have. while i did not want to play this game after i beat it, i never went back to it again. it did not sell in my garage sale and i wanted to make at least $10 off of it. i got better deals selling my gba games. this is worth nothing, just total nothing, garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't let 'reissue' merchants bank on your lack of imagination. Buy something else. It's a mediocre all been done before bore feast. No I haven't bought the game but I've played it and struggled to stay awake. Anyone out there with an original idea for a game? I'm willing to try anything other than 'Whatever No. 2, 3 and 4'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What good is an expansion for an already broken game? Well, it can fix things. Or it can add more dumbness. "Broken World" does the latter. It changes nothing of the fundamental gameplay flaws of the main program, it adds only more stuff to NOT play with. I was so deeply disappointed with DS 2. No, i'm not talking of the graphics. They're ok. It's the gameplay, the balancing, the terrible, terrible savegame-system. Nothing feels right, the interface is cluttered with unreadable fonts, tons of nearly sensless gameplay features are making navigating through the interface and the actual combat often a very frustrating experience. And yes, i've mentioned it. The savegame system! My "favourite"! For God's Sake, dear Developers! Why do you insist on implementing a savegame system, fitting for online play on remote servers FOR A SINGLEPLAYER GAME??? When i am playing with myself ( ;) ) i want so restore the game right at the place and moment i saved it the last time. With DS 1, you got it right. DS 1 was nearly perfect. A little fun arcade hack'nslash game. DS2 and its expansion are complete failures. And no, complexiy does not stand for making everything complicated! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An extremely generic and lifeless shooter. For anything good i can say about it I can say at least 3 bad things. There are unique things at work here like the ability to help you and a teammate mantle a wall that's too high for you to climb, slide under objects instead of crawling, and change gun attachments on the fly like crysis. It shows the devs were putting in at least a little creative thought. Other than that its, basic gun play, with basic guns, with basic shooter mechanics, on boring an unbalanced maps. Sliding is abused to become more of a problem than anything else, which takes away any benefit it would normally give in game. The class system hardly ever comes into play and is more based of what gun you want than anything as you will hardly ever use a classes ability. You move like your walking though water and combat is sluggish and feels too slow. The cash shop is all rentals with no permanent purchases, and In game currency is earned at an insanely slow rate (you'll play maybe 20  30 games to get anything good for maybe a weeks time). I wont say this game is pay to win, its just pay to grind less. But the fact that you will play this game for 4-6 hours and unlock ONE item for a weeks time might as well make it pay to win. Also make wearable items give you perks and people who pay have an insane advantage. Its not as bad as Blacklight, but it is noticeable. Overall this game isn't terrible, but it isn't good either. For a FTP there are much better games out there, including Blacklight (but not by much. I gave it a 5). But i cant recommend this game to anyone. Skip it please. Say what you want about CoD, at least it has the formula down, and i have a lot of fun playing it. This is no CoD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just terrible anyone that says the graphics are good must be blind. It would have been good about 8 years ago(think rainbow six Vegas only with a lot less color). The whole interface is clunky as it chugs to get from one rent this gun page to the next. You like getting shot in the face with a shogun? Well this game is for you. You want that shotgun? Be ready to pay for it because that person that keeps clipping your entire team is paying and there for destroying you. I would much rather be kicked out of servers all day on battlefield or spammed to death on cod ( at least in cod I can obtain that useful weapon) than spend 10 min or any money on this game. Good luck to everyone that thinks its great lets feed that pay to win model! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Warface with its unbearable interface "gface" which constantly lags and does not support the game at all! Duration of loading even the lobby is a catastrophe.

Warface itself has neat graphics and good sounds BUT the gameplay lacks variety: Sure you can double-climb a wall with a partner aaaaaand... yes, that's it. You got your TDM, DM and S&D as standard gameplay mods and END!

The controls feel utterly weird: Your mouse won't move and it feels like pulling your boot through thick sludge, the character animation is stale and boring/generic, the sliding just pisses you off because there is no cooldown time and the aim is not affected by it (sometimes it feels that sliding ppl hit even better).

The last and major point: PAY TO WIN! I don't need to say anything in addition.

2/10 because
+ graphics
+ sounds 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Warface it is something. When it was a great game, when a long time ago ... Now, this is not a game, but something like cheaters contest, where wins the most inventive and brash. For example: one of the servers on which I played was "honest player" with a score of 152/137/35 (murder / headshot / death). In this, unfortunately, you can not play 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Это ужасная игра,если вы в это  о вы мазахист. Начнём с комьюнити, большинство комьюнити составляют школьники, есть и взрослые, только дело в том что школьники называют это игру божественной, а взрослые хоть и  но понимают что это то ещё говно... Ну и конечно же донат, зачем тренеровать скил, аим, брейн, когда ты просто можешь задонаадить 5000 рублей, и нагибать даже профи. Ужасная графика, конечно её как-то пытаются доработать на всё же, чё - то как то не выходит... Куча читаков, тем более разработчики даже не пытаються как то с ними бороться... Ужас... Единственное что в этой игре более менее нормально, так это только PVE (или как их там?) мисси, и до их портит все выше перечисленные пункты. Итог: как я уже сказал это игра для мазахистов, а так же для людей с ужасным вкусом... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pay to Win. Lots of Flaws. Dissapointed because despite being supported by a great Engine(CryEngine) it has so many flaws. These cinematic trailers try to fool you.
Great for uninstalling! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crap game of a once good game developer. This unfinished bug ridden alpha has nothing in common with its predecessors CMBO, CMBB and CMAK.

Nonexistant TacAI, pathfinding is a joke, abysmal gfx programming, many problems with ATI and NVIDIA cards, nonfunctional quick battles, nonimmersive campaign. 

Spare yourself the money to buy this unfinished piece of wanna be wargame. Life is too short to waste time on this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A huge let down from Combat Mission. This is, for all practical purposes, unplayable. Too buggy, terrible AI, confusing interfce and documantation. And especially sinfull in this day and age, terrible graphics. But that's secondary to the game play. Where Combat Mission, all three of them, had game play that totally grabbed you and wouldn't let go, this is just so weak (stand off, hammer the Syrians into dust, move up... if the pathing will let you that is), that it's boring.Too bad, Combat Mission are great games, and if that play had been brought up to date with wonderfull graphics this would have been a winner. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It could have been great, were it not for the omission of the WeGo game mode in multiplayer that made it unique, the horrendous amount of bugs, the annoyingly incompetent AI, the all too obvious use of abstracton grids, the untolerably bad performance on highend machines, the most unnerving and ugly interface since the turn of the century, and other missing but essential features for a game like this like the LOS tool for example. Battlefront seems to have lost their sanity somewhere along the way, and delivered something that only blind fanatics could enjoy without feeling a bit ripped off or betrayed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible dissappointment. Some things can be fixed (but won't be - like trenches turning into indistinct blobs from a few hundred yards out) and some can't (like no proper WEGO). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

By far the worst kart racer I have ever played. It's just such a blatant rush job that it's almost offensive the developers expect people to pay for it. Everything here is botched. The touch screen controls are unresponsive and the regular controls are just too touchy. There is noticeable slow down at times and the loading screens are unbearably long. The whole experience fall flat thanks to it's lack of online multiplayer. Sure you've got ad-hoc and can post your best times from the timed-trials mode, but for the most part your stuck with the crappy single-player modes.

The career mode here is a frustrating waste of time. It feels unbalanced thanks to how much slower your kart is compared to the karts of the AI. Later tours in the career have tracks filled with unfair drop-offs and obstacles that are there for the sole purpose of screwing you out of a victory. To make matters worse the weapons are entirely useless. All in all it's just unfair and no fun to play.

The customization options are all just cosmetic. You can change the way your racer and kart looks, but there's no way to make either go faster or handle better. Track customization barely works thank to the unresponsive touch-screen controls. It all just feels so worthless in the end.

This is one awful kart racer. It's clear the developers rushed it out hoping to get by on name alone. If you're looking for a good kart racer on the Vita I recommend the infinitely superior Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed. It not only includes online multiplayer, but it actually work and is fun to play unlike this travesty of a game. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Easily the worst game I've played. Even as a fan of sandbox-adventure-type games, I found this utterly pointless; it bored me to tears. Just playing it made me feel that I was wasting time in the worst way possible. Essentially, in this game you jump, roll, charge, and steal in a poorly-rendered block-size wasteland. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a 10-minute laugh, if that – the kind of thing that's here today, gone tomorrow, but for a brief moment in history is the talk of Shoreditch and Twitter. It's the gaming equivalent of a novelty single and even the developers, to give credit where it's due, recommend you don't buy it. Listen to them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was designed to give youtubers, like PewDiePie, another means of entertaining stupid tweens {or anyone else with a pedestrian sense of humor}. It's a novelty game, a joke, and it's whole marketing strategy is to reel kids into a self-propagating/forced meme. Not worth 10 dollars. Honestly, you'll have much more fun watching the aforementioned youtube videos than you will breaking the bank for 20 minutes of cheap laughter, if any. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only rated it a 2 because of it being an original style game. It is fun, don't get me wrong, but the game starts to get very boring after 10 minutes of having nothing to do at all except watch yourself get hit by cars and ram people over and over again. The map is very small, nothing to the game at all except basic psychics on a game engine. It's extremely buggy, falling through the map, glitching, etc. Can't expect too much from a small game company just messin around. But definitely not worth buying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game doesn't even last long. You have a little bit of fun with everything then suddenly  its just boring when you see that MICHAEL BAY text for like the third time. sure the game has mutators but that just  gets boring too. Maybe if the game had more Maps then it would be worth going back to see the new jokes the game has. but for now I cannot even laugh while playing this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Funny for 10 minutes, then the game becomes repetitive. And I mean VERY repetitive. Everything is coded to repeat over and over and over again. It's just not funny after everything supposedly "funny" has been done once. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I laughed a bit with the funky physics engine glitches, but in the end, it felt like one of those games where it is severely over-hyped by YT commentators.
Limited map, crap AI (if you could even call it AI, the NPCs don't even move half of the time), and an overall dull, monotonous, repetitive, unrelieved, unvaried, unimaginative, uneventful piece of crap.

Stay away from this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea is somehow nice, but the gameplay gets REALLY boring after some time.
It's one of those PewDiePie games that aren't really good for other uses.
It's absolutely worse than the other games made by the authors. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is no match for panzer dragon orta and forget it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Would you people please tell me what you're smoking, this is easily one of the most painfully crappy games I've ever played. The land-based missions are extremely dull and repetive in terms of both the layout and gameplay. The flying missions work alright control-wise, but are just as boring and trite. All I can say is, please for the love of God, BUT PANZER DRAGOON ORTA INSTEAD D : 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a Where's Waldo game for random objects.  Find all the light bulbs, find all the gears, etc.

The Tiny Bang Story has some nice art, but it is uninspired as a puzzle game, and it punishes the player before providing hints.  Buy this game for a dollar when it appears in the Steam discount bin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good Concept, but poorly executed - lacking the punchy consequence of similar games circa papers, please. Also lacks length, with the game lasting ~ 2hrs at the very most. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is definitely Diablo in space. That is, Diablo 1 pre-alpha. There is no RPG elements beyond choosing which points to spend amongst 4 stats. 1 of which only affects health/stamina pools. That leaves only strength for melee, dexterity for ranged weapons such as bows/slingshots, and intelligence to use ranged energy weapons. A staggering 3 classes, two of which are nearly identical for play. Not much replay value. The levels are not randomly generated. The monsters do not respawn (which limits the total amount of loot/money that can be acquired), and energy used for guns is also the players currency. All of which equals, again, to very limited replay value. Weapons are either melee or ranged. And all ranged weapons in the game shoot a different ball of (insert random color here). There is no AOE (area of effect) fireballs, chain lightning, fire wall, or anything intuitive that allow creative gameplay. Everything that shoots, will do so in a straight line that hits only one target at a time. Melee weapons are pretty much the same thing but with negligible range. They only difference in loot is x-y damage range and duration (which does not last long). Biochips are wearable equipment that gives access to minor spells like town portal, identify, to other things like teleport and flash. It adds a minor change to the banal hacking and slashing but can only be used sparringly due to the high cost of recharging. Interface is very poor. You cannot rebind any keys. Given that there is very little gameplay this becomes less of a problem. But it would be nice to have the option of switching weapons with a key rather than opening the inventory and dragging the item on your character. In addition, you have to manually click on anything you want to attack. Sometimes repeatedly, as you get stunned your character will stand there until you click again. There is no holding down the left/right mouse button and your character will continue to attack despite getting stunned/etc. This game demands a great deal from your wrist. This game is challenging due to the finite resources available to the player. There is a level of scrounging that adds to the atmosphere that I believe is intentional. But I am still highly suspicious of the glowing praise this game has received. So much so, that I was compelled to write a review that fit the game more accurately, in my humble opinion. There is nothing new to the genre here, the music is droning and befitting a generic title such as this, and the gameplay is lacking. Again, the replay value (if you can make it through once), is negligible. For a budget title, there are plenty others at the same price (Fate, Titan Quest) in the bargain bin that can do this type of game much better. Definitely, not worth the price and time spent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

INSTANTLY tedious!  It also crashes if you try to set the video res any higher than 1920.
Here's the synopsis:
-leave compound and punch (yes, punch!) aliens
-after the 4th or 5th one you need to heal
-rinse, repeat a half dozen times....now you can FINALLY buy your first weapon
-hit aliens....run back to heal.
-hit aliens...run back to heal.
-hit aliens.....run back to heal.
-by now you're getting further and further from the base, at which time you realize you have a run meter and you get tired quick. You have to STAND STILL to recover your meter!  You read that correctly....you have to stand and do nothing for your run meter to recharge.

This game is pure fail.  If you want a badass isometric game for free go get Path of Exile and love life again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A younger relative had this game. The graphics are bad. First game that has ever put me to sleep not kidding its boring. The gameplay is that you beat a bunch enimes without any skill at all. The game gets boring because of that 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A great disappointment.  Sudden Strike 2 was so good, this is just too big.  I let it run for an hour whilst I read the newspaper, as my intervention didn't seem to make much difference, just waves of my troops landing and being wiped out.  Who cares who wins? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unit selection and control is a nightmare. IN the heat of battle it's next to impossible to control what really needs to be controlled. Units mix and merge, one arong turn and entire squads are wiped in nano-seconds.

This may be realistic, but it doesn't make for fun gameplay, and as far as realism goes, other games do it better.

Overall, could be a decent game, but a very ropey control system ruins the day for all but the most masochitic players. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible terrible game.The dialogues are childish, the combat is just simple button mashing and the best words to describe the game world are limited, linear, restricted and boring. I am extremely disappointed with this title. It's far worse than even Gothic 3. The Gothic series is dead. Long live Gothic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not impressed. Just got done playing Darksiders 2 and playing this felt like a chore in comparison. Played Torchlight and Magicka before this and they were more interesting. Never really got into Elder Scrolls and haven't played the other Gothic games, so it could just be me and my personal standards/tastes. The pace in this is too slow. Ain't nobody got time fo dat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of Gothic 3 I was very dissapointed with this game, it`s just not good. I do not have much more than that to say about it. Do not buy this game unless you get it almost for free. I`m not the one who likes to say I`ve wasted my money, but I surely did when I bought this game for 50 euros. I gave it a 5 out of 10 because I did somewhat enjoy it, but at a minimal. It is also short and nothing like gothic at all! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the story is cliche the gameplay is terrible you have the walk to much in this game. graphics and music are nice tough. in summary this game is an insult to the gothic franchise and RPGs all together 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I got this game for $2 Australian in China..... in my opinion, its all its worth.. i wouldnt spend and more on it... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Bop-it game stinks, but the other ones work and are extremely fun to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst game Ive ever Picked up.Never Buy this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The forum moderators on steam delete every single negative post about the game. You 're warned.
I actually think they put in more effort in moderating the forums then they actually have put in this broken game.
The things that it promises look very tempting, but the game itself is broken and is littered with bugs, laggy crashing servers, items dissapearing from your inventory, things you build just disappearing right in front of your eyes with no valid explanation and last but not least INSANE CENSORING OF forums 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wish I had something a little more positive to say about the King of Fighters XII, but this one falls way short from calling itself "The King." The backgrounds, while lavish and bright, are sold short by the highly pixelated characters. While they are supposedly hand-drawn, they are still choppy and look extremely dated. Lack of single player options don't do the game any justice either...and one can only assume that they are going to bribe gamers by selling certain trademark characters that do not currently appear in game later down the line as DLC. Combo system is not nearly as complex and intuitive as it could be; easy for beginners, but not really a challenge, nor is it entertaining for fighting game vest. I'd maybe...maybe recommend this as a rental. Stick with BlazBlue. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Single player more is really short, and doen't have a final boss!!! my god how lazy are these people. One of the good things of the KOF games was the variety of characters, something this game also doesn't have!! This game was a waste of my time downloading it. Please please people do not spend money on this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I frown upon this game. The game has good gameplay and most of the graphics are good (I disliked Tiny Kong's), but I dislike the vocals! What are you people doing to the vocals!? Those vocals were absolutely terrible! I usually feel OK with games that do poor on the ratings, but games that I have played in the past make me hope that the game is a good port. Well, it is for the graphics, but terrible for the vocals! I knew the originals went in the trash because most of those vocals were terrible! Bumper and Tiny were OK, but the others stunk. Sorry, but this game needs improvements to sound so that it can retain the original N64 spirit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thanks for ruining Overstrike EA!!! They turned a good idea into a generic, boring third person shooter, with about as much personality as a brick wall. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Insomniac Games hasn't been listening to their fans lately and are now reaping the consequence. Instead of creating a new IP that is fresh, new and innovative they just gave us recycled garbage on a silver platter. It  might seem like I'm exaggerating but believe me, I've played the entire game and every single chapter left me feeling like I was playing a previously released game, which obviously isn't a good thing. I am a long term Insomniac fan and I even supported FFA when many practically  on it. But I simply cannot stand by a game like Fuse. It's honestly sad that they're completely blowing off their fans for the mainstream audience. And yes, I say mainstream as this is a generic military esque shooter. It honestly boggled my mind that IG decided to go down this road but it's their choice and will ultimately be their problem.  2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this game, and have historically liked most snowboarding games (1080 series, SSX series, Amped Series, etc).  However, several things really killed this game for me.  First the controls felt clunky and unrealistic.  The jump landing felt and looked incredibly bad.  Most jump landings that should have ended with my guy flat on his face, unnaturally landed, and kind of just popped the guy into pace.

The graphics were pretty good, though they didn't do a very good job with the motion/snow blur (the graphics were too static when moving, motion blur would have definitely helped).

The exploration part of the game was interesting, and I could see some people really enjoying.  But in general, there seemed to be an overwhelming lack of direction and motivation.  In general it felt like the game, the controls, the physics, the gameplay, and the graphics were never polished.

I guess I will be waiting for another snowboarding game on the PS3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shaun White Snowboarding is not worth your time unless your desperate to waste some cash, though your better off burning it, you'll get the same level of enjoyment from it. Games controls are solid, and thats about all thats good, the story..... is non-existant, the cut scenes are excruciatingly painful to watch, the trick list is 'meh', the four mountains are well made but very plain, the game seems like they went for the realistic snowboard route, but then stopped 3/4 of the way and went for the 'ssx' route, and failed at both. The game lasts about 5 hours before i refused to continue due to utter boredom, the multiplayer is fun.... till you get sick of throwing snowballs at each other, very disapointed as this could have been a good game, but they messed it up at the gameplay aspect, especially the jumping and landing mechanics which can be summed up in one word 'CRAP' although that word could be used for the entire game.
Soundtracks good though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Never having heard of the show, I found this game while browsing through a "going out of business" sale, and for $2 and quite frankly, I was still a bit disappointed.  
The game bounces between an adventure side, in which the main challenge is arriving at whatever destination the poorly motivated plot designates, slowly ambling from point A to point B, through a string of unintuitively designed scenes that loosely correlate to your map.  (which I presume you could get some jollies from if you're into the show...)  these "adventure" segments get even more hindered by dialogue you could expect from a horribly translated saturday morning 8-10 year old target market anime..  (big surprise)

The other half of the game is made up of action levels, which seem alright if you like that sort of generic walk around at wail the attack button thing... The entire thing didn't wow me in the least, if you can avoid this game, I'd highly suggest it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

cant believe i waited for this game it has kick ass graphics bike controls are sweet but the tracks blow stewarts compond is the only track worth riding jumping is lame you seem to guy 90ft up but 2 ft across then other times its the other way around reflex was way better no supercross tracks outdoor tracks are retarded shorts tracks dont even waste or time playing them why cant they just make a game were they have a supercross season an outdoor season make the tracks like real tracks like they race on today ... but on the other hand bikes sound just like the real thing ride wheelies for days ill pay the 60 if thats wht it takes to make a kick ass game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had more fun mocking this game with a friend while I played it than I actually had playing it with my friend.
It is incredibly mediocre, worst motorcross game I've played. Even Motorcross Madness was more fun than this piece of garbage. It has no business being on the 360, I'm not sure it has business being anywhere except maybe at a boredom convention being held in the heart of the sun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's really puzzling how IO didn't seem to learn anything from the mistakes made in the first episode, which was one of the most boring and frustrating TPS I ever got to play gameplay-wise, and that was in spite of a pretty good storytelling and characters. In fact, so much things were broken in this game that I thought this was due to some lack of time and polish near the end of the development (even though the game had been developed and teased for years), but now it seems pretty clear to me that IO just doesn't have the right people who understand how to build a good action game. Combat is so boring and the AI is so grotesque in this game, that I felt like I got warped 15 years back in time to play some Virtua Cop! When your enemies don't lean back and forth endlessly out of cover (sometimes they just won't do anything at all), they'll just run around aimlessly and often right in front of you or your partner. Speaking of him, he's not any better when operated by the AI and will also often cause a lot of frustration (but at least, they had the decency to not make it possible to have him die like in Resident Evil 5 for instance) or just some more embarrassment. Worst of all, the story is really weak this time and almost nothing really interesting gets to happen (apart from one scene which I thought was pretty nice). You'll just spend a few hours wandering through bland corridors of pretty much the same kind of scenery, while fighting your way through countless waves of silly enemies. All of this for an pretty insulting ending that just shouldn't happen in a game that inspires to do cinematic storytelling (unless they were of course going for some kind of Z-Movie ending, which I sincerely doubt).All in all, this just seem to me like another of those game where the lead designers are just so blind by their own "vision, that they just don't seem to care enough about suggestions, critics or even external playtesting. Let's be honest for a second : how else would stuff like that absolutely insane shaky cam  have ended up in the final product? (there's just no way they didn't have time to tweak this the way they wanted to) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whether you judge the sequel on the first absolute flop your going to end up at the same place and thats a waste of time and effort. Kane and Lynch 2 again tried to ride the wave of hype and promise that it will deliver and learn from its mistakes.

Well as many games before it and Im sure many more to come, it delivers nothing new, with little excitement and tries to push grit and gore on you in cut scene's as it knows the gameplay will just simply bore you to tears. Kane and Lynch 2 follows more in the footsteps of Reservoir Dogs ( the game ), Stranglehold, WET, Army of Two ( 1 and 2) and then every other FPS out there. However the story lines, game play, graphics, physics, and general game play were done so much better even from games made long before this coaster or dust collector. Whether it be from incredible poor AI, a graphics system destined on providing you an image of grainy gameplay in an attempt to create atmosphere yet even on a 50 Inch LED comes of as just old and outdated ( God I would hate to play this on an old 68 cm CRT ) or even have gore and risk in the cut scenes only to actually blur or cut out anything that would warrant the game get some sort of mention for pushing boundaries. I know I wasnt expecting much, and surely got even less than I expected but to see games on new consoles being delivered with hype time and time again and then seeing nothing more than out dated, heartless, boring, run of the mill rubbish its a wonder that people arent just packing up the console and moving on to something else. Yet as we come out a global financial crisis, people are still getting payed to release absolute rubbish, dont waste your time or money just hang in there and hope this crap is just a bad dream. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yikes! What the heck? Bad action. Bad story. Bad graphics. Bad this, bad that, bad everything. There is so little value in this game that I feel completely ripped off. I only give it a 2 because the game is not buggy to the point of non-playability. But I can't recommend this to anyone who wants more than a few hours of lousy game play and absolute garbage story and game play mechanics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm don't see how people are giving this full 10s out of 10, or just over 7/10. How can one even sleep at night for firing a guy because he gave the game 6.5 out of 10? That's Gamespot by the way. But this game seriously lacks in the brains department with its poor plot, its shooting gallery gameplay and horrible looking environments. If I wanted disturbing and reality, I'd play the Otherworld act of The Darkness, NOT this. Combat is an unbalanced mess where shotguns beat all, meaning you'll not experiment or bother using a "right tool for the job". The multiplayer is its only redeeming factor, because the single player is only 3-6 hours long. A poor effort, and one of Square Enix's worst choices. Though that's not saying much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible just like the first one. Levels are all similar and boring with same enemies. You have a set number of continues then have to repeat entire 10 min long level, no thanks. The worst part is the controls. They still somehow haven't figured how to make it work after all these games. It shoots up diagonally when you shoot it but you never know exactly where it will go, and during swinging if you aren't perfectly lined up with its diagonal path you die. Shooting forwards requires holding downwards shooting (huh?). All the aiming requires combos of directions and shooting which are unintuitive and not helpful during fast motion activities. You can jump now in this one but its 1 inch off the ground. Cant jump and grab ledges, and cant grab while falling. Seemingly easy jumps made impossible by the terrible controls. You feel like tank that ways 1000 lbs, which is just sad for a platformer in 2011. It is stuck with platforming controls, mechanics, level design, save system, and enemies from late 80's/early 90's. There's a reason things have progressed since then. Guess capcom didn't get the memo. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not worth it....at all. It seems the Devs have lost focus on what makes the Total War series good. Instead of fixing a still broken game, they try an fix it in a mini dlc, which offers nothing new other then slight changes you can do yourself with player mods. I mean seriously....no offense to Caesar fans, but they could have chosen a much better Era during roman times for this DLC....Gaul conquests are boring, and even more boring in Caesar in Gaul. What ever happened to all nations feeling unique? Those historic pop ups that would educate you or give you a choice that could really change the outcome of your campaign? Those cool videos that agents had when they failed or were successful in a mission? Coop or Head 2 head games that players could both move at the same time? This DLC sucks...for a game which is still broken. Rome 2 is still the worst of the TW Franchise and this DLC just rubs salt on the wounds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

they really need to work on the concept of finishing the game completely before releasing it to the public. ive waited for weeks for the last patch and thier still not close to fixing all the nagging bugs. a simply sloppily made game. not worth the money to buy new. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Patched twice but no problems sovled. The game is unplayable as it crashes constantly. Too bad, it looked ike it coud have been a good game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a deception ! This last opus is currently the same game as Strohghold I with 3D added. Unfortunately, graphics are very poor, back 4 years ago and the game is bugged. AI is prehistoric and after playing few hours, you still don't have fun.... Stronghold and Stronghold crusader were really good game but this new one is terrible. I'm just upset about myself having bought the game without looking at the evaluations on internet....save your money buy something else ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is good, except the frame rates and lag issues are horrible, ive waited for a long time for this game to come out, im really disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game management AI is hit and miss  freezes even graphic quality turned down  Com AI is not very stable attacking randomly  predictable failures brought on by civilians Sub par voice acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I find it hard to illustrate how good or bad this game is, on one hand it isn't the worst product on the market, yet on the other it's almost an embarrassment to video gaming as a whole. I'll give it credit for being occasionally pretty, the visuals can be quite nice even withe the FPS and all that. Next I'll give it a point for not being riddled with bugs like some other games can be, so that's a positive.

Now onto the actual game, it's incredibly short. You are looking at around 2.5-3 hours of play time with the rest being cut scenes, some cut scenes are almost 45 minutes long. Straight. Fighting is basic cover, shoot followed by tons on QTE's. As has been mentioned there are even QTE sequences that are literally copied throughout the game. It's the same exact sequences.

This game has no replay value, no extra modes, no real anything extra. There are no choices, there is no exploring, it's an on the rails cinematic experience with poor FPS and a bad, poorly thought out story. Rent this game, beat it in a couple hours and you will still feel ripped off. This game is the definition of bad. It's the definition of a video game failure. The only reason I won't score lower is because it technically could have been completely broken and never looked pretty at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this 2 points because of the visuals alone. They are great. The problem is that is all there is to the Order 1886. There is almost no gameplay worth speaking of, the story is cliche and not interesting, enemies are recycles, the characters are flat. Maybe the developers shouldn't have said "Gameplay is something that...it's a game, we can't get around it."

Well there certainly is little to do in this title other than the odd QTE or failproof cover based shooter section. For a game that was going to rely so much on its story that area is really poor as well. I assume the writers' penmanship was too bad for Hollywood so they went for the video game industry. Please don't repeat this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game represents everything wrong with modern gaming:

- Uninteresting and boring story that you'll forget about in a month or less, combined with a terrible ending that screams BUY THE SEQUEL TO SEE THE REST AND GIVE US MORE MONEY!
- Lackluster gameplay that doesn't add anything new to the table
- QTEs shoved down your throat
- Very easy, even at HARD DIFFICULTY
- No replayability
- Only the graphics are good

You think it's over? Oh no, there's more:

- You spend more time watching cutscenes than playing the  game (yes MGS does the same thing but whatever little gameplay had was actually good, gameplay here is dull at best).
- QTEs every 5 minutes of gameplay (you have to press buttons EVEN TO TALK at some point of the game)
- The game can be completed in less than 5 hours... but without the unskippable cutscenes it wouldn't even last 2 hours (why do you think they made them unskippable?)

The only positive thing I can say about this game is that there isn't any shoehorned multiplayer mode.
But that's pretty much it.

My vote is 2/10. Avoid this game and save your money for Bloodborne which is actually good.

P.S. to Dana Jan: people are hating on this game because it's a piece of garbage and they're tired of wasting 60$ on games that are not worth it. Maybe if you had spent more time on the actual gameplay and less on the graphics the reaction wouldn't be so negative. Cry me a river. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm just going to say it; Anyone who gave this game more than 7 is a graphics wh*re. The gameplay is terrible.
Those people should go play Ocarina of Time to learn how games are supposed to be designed.

This is not a game, it's a 6 hour movie. Which would be OK if the story was good. It isn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WOW 7 hours of gameplay.  Are you freaking kidding me????  Totally linear, the action is fun BUT 7 HOURS for 60 dollars??? I love 3rd person action games.  But waaaay too linear,  no development of the character.

You see all these weapons in the game guide,  BTW  WHY IS THERE A GAME GUIDE??!!    It says something along the lines of  make sure you pick the right weapons before a mission.  THERE is NO picking of weapons!!!   You can pick up other ones but wow.

I wish I could return it to Gamestop tomorrow and get my money back because I feel totally freaking Robbed!!!    How can you give 7 hours of Gameplay a positive review???  HAS to be people hired by the developers.  WOW I forgot about Video sequences so way less than 7 hours of gameplay!!  Maybe 4.

BTW it costs you about $25  to get a Blue Ray movie.   Did I mention that the game is Letterboxed?  so you don't even get your full TVs picture. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your left feeling like u barely did anything after just slow playing I got 12 hours . 1/3 I got to control .
Well done in design but like all 8th gen console games more glitz than substance.

They should have put more into game mechanics instead of ultra realistic graphics which kind of downplay even more the sad broken game ai. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good Grafix but the game is boooooooooooring and short. They should have called it The Order $18.86 price tag.  Not worth a purchase, maybe a rental for how short and lame it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Order is a smart template for future fun installments, but the details need a lot of work. When it comes to getting this kind of game onto Next Gen hardware then, Ready at Dawn has, in more ways than one, done all the boring parts. The Order mimics Gears of War's core gameplay so closely that if it were published on Xbox One, it would have been immediately branded as a desperate knock-off. Avoid The Order unless you see it in a used bin for under $30. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Order: 1886  -

Gameplay/Playability – I will probably lose anyone who tied themselves to this game prior to playing it, but this isn’t a game. Many people compare it to currently existing episodic releases from TellTale games as a Story driven game.  The game strips gameplay for street cred and hipster flair. Meeting Tesla, being a Knight of the Round Table, the Steam Punk punk, Vampire & Lycan wars, Conspiracy theories (which are of course always true in gaming). The game felt like someone rushed to piece together all the big ticket games of 2013 + 2014 to make a sweet tech demo. There is shooting, which I personally couldn’t get behind as it all felt extremely scripted and a majority of it goes into QTE that aren’t about measuring reaction time so much as making sure the movie you watch is very intense. Im going to go by the fact that as far as a 6 hour game is concerned I only need my controller half the time and of the time I was using my controller it was very minimal, usually around 2 buttons or joystick only.  – 4 (No bugs or fails just boring)

S – Sound quality was great but nothing amazing, no amazing songs, no amazing sound in all it was a very hit the AAA standard moment for them on this. – 6

Graphics – They are definitely next gen and definitely console. It’s pretty, however if this is a selling point for you then buy a PC otherwise you will be lacking on the greatest available graphics. – 6 Graphics are good but still console and still not anything awe inspiring when compared to last gen.

Story – Ugh… Can we just call it a self-indulgent rip off of most every video game movie in the genre it’s trying to hit? If you are up on Pop culture of any aspect of the game it will have not one original moment and as with all video games the writing is just a bit clichéd and saddening only because it is trying so very hard. – 2  It has a story and they attempted to make it flow and makes sense minus the drop off of so many thing.

Replayability – If anyone tells you this game has replay ability they are lying to you or they are trying way too hard to defend this game. Like all story driven games its really one and done. Most of the gunfights happen in narrow one room hallways or artificially opened corridors. It is very linear and defined, It would be like saying you want to watch a 6 hour movie again that occasionally pauses the movie for you so you have to push play again. Once is enough for me – 0

Though it averages close to a 4 Im docking 2 additional points for the developer’s reaction to criticism. The game is only 6 hours for them to say it was 10+ is an insult to gamers, it means they assume were too dumb to follow written prompts or so desperate to explore everything that we will check out floor grain textures for 4 hours. Also never compare steak to a video game, they are hugely different.

Final score 2 – Its more of a movie then a game. Check out a good Lets Player. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total time| 5 hrs 25 min - Gameplay 3 hrs 6 min - QTE 11:03 – Cutscenes 2 hrs 7 min. Rent this at Redbox or similar service. It is not a good value for the full purchase price. I finished the game at between 5-6 hours. I did not clock the time but found a breakdown that is at the top of the article that rings true. I bet the cut scenes cannot be skipped to add bulk to the "playtime". It is a beautiful looking game with a good premise and excellent voice acting. However the gameplay is repetitive, highly derivative, and been better in other games. The way things wrap up in a pretty abrupt manner leaves things open for a sequel. I have a suspicion that the developer bit off more then it could chew in creating content though which contributed to the brevity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I regret buying a PS4 for this game. I'd be willing to forgive the lack of "gameplay" if the story was engaging enough. Sadly that isn't the case as the story is predictable from the word go. Proof that graphics alone don't make a game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphically and artistically it is superb, it must be confessed. However, is this really what one would expect from a video game? I DONT NO. The developers have chosen to offer a gaming experience mixed with a movie, I respect that choice. BUT it would have taken advantage of developing the concept.

Currently we have:
A graphically stunning game
Proper gameplay
? ... And that's it

The game features a very limited life, count about 6 hours (3 hours of cutscenes, 40 minutes and QTE gameplay 2:20) to finish it. Add to that no replayability, with a very basic scenario. It's fine to offer this kind of experience, but why not have gone further experience with the integration of such dialogue choices leading to alternative endings? The AI ​​enemies and allies characters is completely at the picks. The only phase one we play is to search places (to get to a point highlighted and press a key to see the object, we may even move back and WOW ...) or what are gun-fight long enough and soon becoming tiresome. And finaly, I have to confess I'm french, and we have an horrible french dubbing, however, a poor dialogue writing can't give a good translation (I've watch the game in english to hear). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me start by saying people give this game a 10 either aren't being honest or dont play/like video games.

I had high hopes for this game because I played and loved the PSP versions of the God of War games. The Order 1886 unfortunately doesn't even come close to those games.

The Order begins in the present with Sir Galahad being in prison. It makes a transition to the past and the "game" begins. From the start the gun play has problems. Often times you'll zero in on a head shot and miss even though you are aiming at the head, pistols seem to have better chances to hit its target. The gun fights are your very basic unoriginal take cover wait for dumb bot to come out of cover and fire. Repeat several times and you're done. When it comes time to fight the Werewolves its a lame QTE. There are a few some what platforming sections but unfortunately they are very small.

The game looks beautiful but it become apparent quickly that graphic is what this game is all about as whole chapters are nothing but you sitting and watching. Which brings me to the story, oh the story.

The story is about King Auther and the knights of the round table who through the magic of the holy grail have managed to live unnaturally long lives and heal themselves through the black water as they call it. You later find out that not all actually any of them but one is left over from that time period all the others have taken on the names of the knights. The Order fights wait for it Werewolves and Vampires. As has become the standard for some reason in recent movies, books and other media the Vampires control the Werewolves and are trying to spread all over the world.

The game is very short and has almost nothing to explore or discover leaving you to simple run the little maze they have set up as a stage to get to the end.

The Order is another game in a trend these days of games promising thing but unable or unwilling to deliver on them. Save your 60$ and wait for ot to hit the 5$ bin at gamestop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game without a lot of action, a lot of talk but of 5 terrible chapters where did nothing the game is not worth the price asked. The game only has graphic and sound great quality, for those who want to watch and added the game instead of playing I recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I grabbed my popcorn and controller, and then set up my PS4 to play the most recently and greatly hyped movie this year!  5 hours is way too long for a movie, I went through like 7 bags of popcorn by the time I finally got to the end, only to think "I swear I seen this battle before" with the final boss.  And funnily enough, I had!  It was a direct copy-paste of a previous encounter with a random werewolf! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the game is only 3 hours long. its filled with a ton of quick time events. barley any game play. not worth $60, hell its not even worth $15. The game is more of a movie than a game and a pretty bad, generic movie at that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After having heard all of the bad reviews of The Order 1886, I decided to wait until it came out secondhand before even risking it. Glad I did. It left me feeling like when you go to see an over-hyped movie that's pure Sh-- ...garbage.

Quick Summary:
World Aesthetic Design: Nothing special.  Assassin’s creed syndicate is far better
Players Options:  None.  The game is 100% linear. Nothing you can do to change that.
Control over character: Limited motion, no tech tree or leveling of any sort. Combat is like a watered down CoD.
Story: Okay. Nothing special.
Concept: Kind of cool Steampunk thing going on.
Difficulty: The only games I have played that were easier were Telltale games.

Duration of Entertainment: You can finish the game in 8 hours.  Half the time you’ll be watching cut-scenes.
As it’s 100% linear, there is no real replay value. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My god!
Its ok to make a game hardly interactive, but I'm seriously falling asleep just reading the characters bio.
They are all just cliches of characters we have seen million and million times.
How can a studio have so many talented people work for them and such a great engine, and then falter at the most important point!
CONTENT! Why is it the same thing every time?
BORING! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the weakest things I have ever played. I am not going to give this game props for its graphics. Its 2015. I expect graphics to be pretty. I would have taken PS2 level graphics if I had more game play. I earned a trophy for walking and watching a conversation!! This is pathetic. Great Ideas, pretty graphics and absolutely no reason to play, that's right the term is PLAY, it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very boring, bland and tedious game regardless of how good the graphics are, i played the first hour, it was like paying to pull my own teeth out, needless to say its a game id never pick up again, i traded it and i have great pity for the poor bugger who buys it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is gameplay-wise like a game from Telltale without a griping story.

It gains (some) momentum at about 4 hours and ends abruptly one hour later after about half the promised story told.

Not nearly worth the current price, but buy it now, play it through and resell it for 10 bucks less. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is no doubt that this game is absolutely beautiful. The biggest problem is that this game isn't much of a game. It is much more a movie or an interactive film. The entire point in a game is something that sucks you in and game play that excites you and makes you loose track of the time. This "game" does not do this. The story and acting are amazing but I'm writing this review focusing on the video game aspects such as game play. The shooting and movement is solid but it is so incredibly boring shooting people that all look the same. This game was actually very boring. For long sections you can just put the controller down. This is an amazing work of art but it is not an entertaining video game. Mostly cut scenes or walking around. This game is not worth full price. If future video games are going to be presented like this, an immersive film, I fear for the video games I love that you can play for hours on end. With no replay value at all this game has a very short life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is awful, don't pay for it. See they sell you the story, they interest you with the story, that's how they trap you. And I say trap because when you actually play this 'Game'. The gameplay is dumbed down to the point that the enemies have half their bodies hanging out of cover, they don't try to dodge or hide from you. Werewolves slap you, knock you down.. then RUN AWAY!!! WTF!!! They allow you to not just live, but get back up, dust yourself off, call your girlfriend to tell you you're ok, smoke a cig, then they come back and try to Knock you down again. and yep you guessed it! if you don't kill them they'll knock you down and do the same thing all over again.

When I was younger, I probably would've liked a game like this, when you were a kid and things were easy, you didn't have to think much, just grabbed a controller and derped. That's what this game is, there is no challenge. even when you put it on hard difficulty, you have slow motion and you can heal full health in 1.5 seconds with their auto regen system cuz too lazy to put any other healing system in... Maybe have the guy drink blood? water? stimpack? health kit? auto-regen health... W...T...F... and you heal up from red screen to healthy in 1.5 seconds. So easy!. The enemies don't try to flank you, so yes. you can take a bullet, hide... heal. do it all over again. EASY.

2 points, .5 for Nicola Tesla, .5 for Victorian London. 1. for graphics. -8 for horrible gameplay and them calling this a 'video game'. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody besides nobody 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has made me not want to digitally download anything anymore because I would be returning this next week due to the lack of content and gameplay, and zero replay value.  It should be more in the $20 range, not $60.  They spent a ton of time perfecting the visual piece of it, and they did do a nice job with that.  The weapons were also creative, but there's just too not enough content to ask that price.  They (allegedly) strung together the cinematic scenes with the (limited) game to make it a fluid experience.  To me, it was because they just didn't have enough gameplay, so they mandated you watch every cut scene because otherwise, if they didn't, the game would play through in probably 4 hours. Honestly, It's like you're not even there most of the time.  It has to be like 40% cut scenes.  The great next gen games allow you to go almost anywhere and interactive with the environment.  In The Order, everything is roped off or unreachable.  It's pretty annoying.  It has a "look, but don't touch" feel to it.  You're better off buying a full length animated film for $10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man i love all this damage control all the fanboys are tying to give. the game is only 5-7hours, with a subpar story leaving plot holes as far as the eye can see, with an underwhelming ending full of QTEs, just like the rest of the game. 2/3rds of the game is nothing but cutscenes. barebones 3rd person shooter gameplay and nothing else to do after youve completed the shallow story. at least ryse had a fun co-op multiplayer after its sub par campaign, that's much better than this over-hyped mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a let down of a game. yeah sure it was very good looking but it was too linear felt more like the gameplay of ps2 game rather than a ps4. If it had advertised itself as a play along film then fair enough but this was not the case it was portrayed to be a new start to the next gen of combat games but the combat was broken down to two types of enemies the ones who stick to cover and the ones who run you down this is not what I expect from the A.I of a modern game. over all it left me feeling cheated out my money and frustrated that i played along with a movie. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let me star with the following fact;  Evolve > The Order: 1886.  If you want a great looking interactive movie with shooting sequences more frustrating than Gears of War, this game is it. I really don't know whats going through developers heads now days, with Destiny, Evolve, The order, PS3 remakes… 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a game that proves, graphics are not everything in a video game. Basic mediocre shooting mechanics with so much QTE it sickens me. A poor story with a HORRIBLE ending, 2 boss battles in the game, both being Quick Time Events but what is even more insulting is that the final boss battle is a COMPLETE COPY OF THE FIRST BATTLE. I'm so disappointed in PlayStation gamers for saying this demo, and a **** demo at that, is worth $60! Took me 5 hours to beat the single player, yeah the multiplayer is ok but... wait... THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER! Please, for the sake of your wallet, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought the reviews were going to be wrong about this game even after i read them i just though 'hey it cant be that bad can it' and well i was wrong it is a terrible game, infact to call it a game is silly its just like a movie but with the occasional lets have you do some bits here, i spent most of my time feeling bored and unhappy whilst playing it, there was no oomf to shooting the enemies. it has **** quicktime fighting events why cant i just smash sqaure to punch instead of these press sqaure or triangle at the appropriate time, it's boring. i would say its nice to look at if they didn't cut off the top and bottom parts of the screen but not they decided lets try make it look more like a movie, i don't think they realise they are making a game if you want to make a **** movie go make a movie not a video game that is basically a movie with half arsed gameplay. if im honest the most fun i had in the whole game was when i picked a lock that was the best part for some reason, but everything else just felt so dull. the game is so grey i know its set in the victorian times but i dont care it would have been nicer if they just coloured it all in brightley, infact it would have probably made it more playable. I watched the little making of the game before it came out and it spoke about how they wanted the way the werewolfs changed to look realistic and that was far more interesting than the whole game, why is that i don't know.  In the end i never completed the game i found myself looking at my phone more than the game and decided that i cannot be arsed wasting time off work to play a bad game. Don't buy the game, dont even borrow it, dont trade it in, just smash it up or bury it in a park it's just a **** awful game i do not recomend wasting your time on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An anemic story, coupled with less than thrilling gunplay, pointless gameplay changes midway through (instant death stealth portions which betray the rest of the style of the game) and annoying black bars at the top and bottom of the screen amount to this counterfeit and clearly inferior Uncharted game. This game is visually stunning, which only serves to show how lacking the rest of the game is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where is Maxis!? The life and soul have been ripped out of this game. Only the cosmetics have improved. Instead of being a governor, you're now a town planner with no political decisions to make, like taxes and laws. Its just been simplified for children like Settlers was. Hopefully its a one off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Take everything you know and love about the SimCity series and throw it out the window. Will Wright and Maxis weren't even involved in this game. You don't actually build anything per se. I was disappointed and now continue to play SimCity 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My son loved SimCity 4 and was really looking forward to this game, but when he tried it he was so disappointed he cried. I have to agree that this is a huge step back from the earlier SimCity titles, with a lot of bugs thrown in. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SimCity Societies is the mother of all gaming messups. The level of excessive micromanagement in the game is unreal. Why do I need to place every single house and business? Simcity 4 was unique in the sense that you could zone a patch of land and watch your city grow. The new additions to the game are totally out of place for a SimCity game. Such as setting a 'theme' for your city. The whole game itself feels very unfinished and the interface is one of the most unintuitive since X2. An unfitting end to the SimCity series. Which does not deserve the Sim title at all. It's very clear from the start that this wasn't made by Maxis. Thumbs down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Now beating a dead horse until his bones are reduced to sand particles, the Sonic team attempted to clone Super Mario Galaxy...without the fun.

If we had to quickly mention the good points of the game, it'd be the artistic design of the environment, and some of the power ups that are a bit interesting to use.

The bad points? Well, everything else. The controls aren't very intuitive or make much sense sometimes, half the power ups are not fun to use, the level design in the non straight-forward levels is an utter mess, the gameplay just doesn't go accordingly to Sonic (tight platforming with a character who's supposed to run at tremendous speed, anyone else sees the problem?), and overall just not fun at all.

In short : Sonic Team once again made a game that was not fit for their mascot and ridiculed him further again. They keep trying too hard on originality, but that just didn't work. I barely recommend to even glance at this game in the game stores. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This hardly deserves to be a Sonic game at all. In Sonic Lost World, Sonic Team discards many of the things that have made previous titles great, such as the smooth and fluid boost-based gameplay as well as the gorgeous visuals. Replacing these elements are things like slow, jittery controls, awful level design, a hideous art style, and practically nonexistent physics. In addition, the music, villain designs, and attempts at lighthearted "humor" in the cutscenes are downright cringe-worthy. Overall, the whole game seems broken and unfinished, as if it were developed on a very tight budget. I would not recommend this to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Graphics are good, but so is everything else nowerdays. Easy on the eyes, but thats only because the majority of it consists of Brown, and nothing but. The storyline without the use of profanity can only be described as confusing. Contains the standard "press left, now right, now up" button mashing boredom that all games have seem to think is now law. The final insult is that whenever you kill something, it's sibling will appear to take its place, followed by another, and another. A lot of work has been put into it and its by no means terrible, but unfortunately it isn't good work and just lacks the criteria that would keep anything above a casual player from wanting to play it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Undying was a much better title to carry Barkers name. This is on the rails all the way through, no exploring or innovating allowed. Dumb enemies, dumb squad behaviour, forgivable if this was a 3 year old game, but it's not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bah its a hard to control mess. Boring old characters you have to run round reviving all the time, no fun in my book. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor team AI (its a good job you can revive team mates), bugs if you change from default controls (like you cannot pass survival events), railed gameplay. Less than average overall - I had high hopes due to Clive Barkers tag on it, but alas it doesnt come close to what I feel it could have with a little more development, and some valid PC testing.

This is one of the worst games around. Sure it's an old game remade but it just isn't fun to play. It's shallow, uninteresting and basic. A monkey holding forwards and kick could get through the first two levels. In redemption the power up system LOOKS fun, but isn't really. Avoid unless you want a taste of how things were. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm very disappointed by the use of a strange type of Alway On DRM in this game. When not connected to the internet you can play the game, but you can't make any progress. You can't ever get to the next level. To unlock new levels you have to play in "Normal Mode" (online) as opposed to "Local Mode", as the makers call it. There are also severe bugs that mean you can't play the game directly from Steam on Mac, but have to locate the application folder and run it directly. Apart from that, the game is OK. The game is novel with the way the level gets built around you as containers crash into your ship, every container having it's own gravity, and being able to make short leaps through open space. But after you've seen all that in the first five minutes, the game becomes very, very repetitive. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really didn't want to give a bad score to a Front Mission game, but this one takes the biscuit...Bought from Steam (after a wonderful holiday of cheap deals!)- it states "multi language" on the shop page... fair enough, PAY done... woot ...  Start the game, NO LANGUAGE OPTIONS... The language is automatically set to the country you live in .... in my case ; Japan,  - thanks! . ...  bite the hand that feeds you why not!?From the intro, you could tell this was a "ruined by Hollywood" take on a Japanese game.  All action, no tension.  You know, Id prefer it to have the 2d faces speaking to than the crappy 3D acting.  (the speech is in English, text in Japanese...)The game?  Its "alright" to a sense it is VERY linear (go this way then that way then) - the game mechanics feel VERY old, especially in the time of open world sandbox simulation! - I mean, ... you're a huge mech for cyring out loud! Controls dont necessarily feel wrong - theyre mostly tried and tested from the normal shootemup genre. WASD and mouse...  or a joypad.  Its a shame that it doesnt take some cues from some mech simulation games.My rundown, this one is good if you've never played an FPS or mech game in your life...  otherwise, look elsewhere! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game looks phenomenal and the core concept is great, but the final product is just incredibly boring. You need to have large amounts of patience while waiting for the animals to get into the position you need. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Turn based army fighting would have saved this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game really disappointed me. After a wonderful experience I had with Pac-Man World 2, a simple, fun and hard platformer/collectathon, this generic (that's even better than what I really think of it) wonky, glitchy game gave me a real headache. The levels aren't nearly as creative, the dialogue completely ruins our silent hero, the story is just plain annoying, and the fight mechanic is horrible and unneeded, at most. It's Crash of the Titans all over again. Why couldn't they just stick with the gold? I loved 2 so much! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's terrible.
It was terrible back in the 2006 when it came out, and it still is a terrible game that probably shouldn't be made.
The game is huge, but outside Myrtana it's just big, empty spaces that just annoy you, have no real purpose being in the game and doesn't really fit in the theme Gothic 3 should look like. Besides throwing in more unispired slashing thousands of enemies and making game unnecessary longer. And no - killing an entire orc army all by yourself is not epic.
Myrtana looks amazing and has it charm, but it's an empty shell. Quests are few and most of them don't make any sense, main quest is a mess. 3 different areas tend to contradict themselves, since you can ally with orcs in Myrtana and kill every single orc in Nordmar. Khan will still love you after you return to him all like "oh hai, I just killed all your armies just up ahead in the mountains". Side factions are forced and useless (why would anyone use druid stones?). The overall theme is ruined. Orcs are turned into some kind of parody of themselves. The game tells us that they've learned human language only for basic communications with their new slaves and mercenaries but... all we hear of their native language is "mora" and they speak with eachother in english. Yeah. Weird design decisions (reworked magic and teleport stones lying around just for you to pick up).
The game is entertaining to the certain point, where you run around Myrtana and do basic stuff, but after you enter Nordmar or Varant you can turn it off, loosing nothing of value. The game is artificially prolonged beyond any reasons - we're given "collect X quest" which is all about killing hundreds of undeads in plain desert and badly designed temples made from 3 corridors.

Aside dreadful fundamental flaws, the game is full of game breaking bugs that are impossible to fix. Fan made patch makes things a little better, but it's still a mess. Content packs just make things worse, throwing in some balance breaking stuff and one of the most infantile fan-made quests I've ever seen that absolutely break the game in terms of the entertainment. The quest-pack and content-mod feel like made by 8-years olds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hey Clive did you ever see a game by the name of Fear? Now thats scary! Also note that Scripted button tapping is just plain stupid in any game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really don't know where everyone is getting this "great graphics!" nonsense from.... Jericho doesn't look as good as some titles on the original Xbox. Regardless, the real problem with this game is bad gameplay. The "leap from squad member to squad member" gameplay that didn't work for Brute Force or the first Ghost Recon (or any other game for that matter) is even worse here. If you are resorting to playing this game then you are just simply way too desperate for FPS's (there are no less than 15 better FPS games on the 360) and should seek mental help. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I saw a couple of user comments comparing Socom to COD4 which doesn't do COD4 any justice at all. COD4 is a well designed game with intuitive and easy-to-use controls, solid online play, and impressive graphics, all the things Socom doesn't have. Sorry guys, perhaps Socom used to be a great game but this new reincarnation just isn't such a good deal after all. I hope they improve the game soon, it does have potential, but otherwise I am off to COD5 or whatever other good FPS/TPS comes along. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. I dont know where to start regarding how bad this iteration of SOCOM Navy SEALs is. The only think I thought was neat and innovative was the proximity mic feature. They tried so hard to appease the players that complained about people ranking up but in that ruined the integrity of the game. Its all about online play. Nobody will join a custom room that is unranked. The idiot community is so hung up on rank and Slant Six set this up for failure. The launch delays, slow load up speeds, over the shoulder view, how the games are scored... I could go on. On the POSITIVE side it plays better than SOCOM 4!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never had a PS2,but always wanted to play the Socom games,as they look right up my street.So now i have a PS3,i was looking forward to finally being able to get in on Socom.How disappointed was i,when i found out that Socom-Confrontation was to be a 'Multiplayer only' game?!.. Theres 3 reasons why i dont like this game. 1.Its a multiplayer game only.I have an issue with ANY game that only has a multiplayer mode,as they are boring,repetitive,shallow,& rely on you having access to the internet & an internet connection to be able to actually play the thing.& when the games servers are shut down,or no-one is playing it anymore,what your left with,is an expensive paperweight.. 2.The game is very buggy & glitchy,is ropey graphically & doesnt play very well,& 3.This game has nothing in common with what Navy SEALS are actually about.. The very nature of Navy SEAL operations,like other Special Forces is about going in,accomplishing a specific mission objective,then getting out with as little 'Confrontation' as possible.Not lingering in the same area,in a sustained firefight,for no particular reason,Risking life & wasting precious ammo in a 'TEAM A versus TEAM B' fight! Dear oh Dear... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a truly bad game, but not for the reasons you most hear. The biggest issue is the completely guided almost rail shooter experience. Your only choices seem to be which gun to use. You cannot choose to use your sword outside of the specifically scripted Sword fights and you can't pull an Indiana Jones and just shoot the guys swinging the sword around. I must agree with everyone that the sword controls are a travesty, the story and voice acting a sin, and the guns aren't anywhere as good as "Call of Duty 3" Do yourself a favour and prey for a Star wars Light Saber game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gun sensitivity is too high for my liking, I twitch and it goes and swings around 90 degrees and the sword sensitivity is too low for my liking, and it won't let me cut horizontally when I want to! It seems to me like it was so rushed that it was just a bunch of bits and pieces smashed together in to a passable game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played the 2nd game first and I liked it quite a lot, so I thought I would give the first one a try. The first red steel really sucks for me compared to red steel 2. I really liked Red Steel 2 but Red Steel 1 was totally bland compared to number 2. In number 2 you can use the gun and sword any time you want while in red steel 1 you can only use certain things at certain times. Swordplay is also much better in Nr.2 because of Motion Plus. I recommend to anyone to skip one and go straight to 2. You will get the story of 2 without having played 1. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has the same story as every action movie that has been made in the past thirty years.The action is terrible, the music sounds like it was made in the 80's and the controls are pure  The more I played this game the more I really just wanted to return it. The characters are badly writing because they are Asian american stereotypes. You play as a bodyguard what is also marring the daughter of a very respected Asian gang. The problem is that a rival gang has killed your boss an stolen your fiance. That is the most lazy and reused idea EVER!!!!!! Its like zombies and vampires had a baby and the baby was born to play in a kart racer! This game was made just to show off the Wii's motion controls and that's it. This game is horrible and it shows with badly thought out game design and very little effect other than that when you move the Wii mote the sword moves almost a whole ten seconds after your actual movement. Avoid this game at all cost don't buy this for anything less than free. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game would have been a decent shooter, but it is crippled by bugs and lag issues that make the game almost entirely unplayable to a good portion of their consumer base. Normally, when there is a debilitating bug present in a game that makes the game unplayable, developers rush to patch it within a few days. Zombie Studios, however, dragged their feet long enough delaying this essential patch that their player base has nearly completely dried up. What would have been a decent shooter, has turned into an unplayable mess, and a good portion of their customers have been left high and dry. Do not buy this game!Here is a quick list of known bugs in version 1.0:1) "Hitching" which is the main bug issue. It is basically the whole game freezing every few seconds for about half a second to a full second, making a shooter virtually unplayable.2) Team Deathmatch loading screen freezes on a regular basis.3) Sniper rifles seem to suffer from severe bullet lag. You can scope in, shoot a round, and wait 1/2 to a full second before observing the round hit the wall, where the target use to be. 4) Light Machine Guns are grossly underpowered at low rank. LMGs should always have an accuracy advantage over Sub Machine Guns. You take a hit with mobility, yet there is no payoff for that loss. Accuracy needs to be increased across the board for LMGs. Furthermore, a bit of a decrease in accuracy for SMGs are in order.5) The host of a room has far too much of an advantage vs. everyone else. I have been host a few times and ran around virtually invincible until the game ended. Having a full second of advantage over everyone in your room, whether it is multiplayer or co-op, is a little too much.6) Lack of description for what any weapon part or "mod stat" does. It's incredibly stupid that no one knows what items do what in the game without referring to fanboys on the internet. Your basically creating loadouts for your characters without knowing what the items do, or even what the general stats mean (There are just random icons with no description). What's more, when asking the developers on their forum, they all gave different answers. They don't even know!7) Cooked a grenade and hit the melee button while it was in hand. Grenade became permanently attached to my hand and I could do nothing but wait until someone killed me.Why I did not give this game a 1 was because under all of the problems that killed the game, there was a decent shooter. If only they didn't push out a highly defective product, their consumers would have been very happy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm very disappointed this game. Much worse than the Lost Planet 1. Not really have story, and the singleplayer is bad. Graphics are okay. With 3 AI teammates *****. Can't controlling on pc. Cheap PC port, than the Lost Planet 1, but its worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's nothing particularly innovative or exciting about this game. I'm a big fan of city-builders but this does nothing to improve on what's already out there, and in many ways is actually worse. At best, it feels like I 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a giant turd of a game. First of all, 15 bucks? Are you kidding me? Secondly offline only coop? Seriously? How lazy/greedy can you be? The 'humor' in this game is mildly funny at best but mostly just plain groan inducing. Introducing explicatives in odd places does NOT equal comedy folks. The controls are usable I suppose but you never feel like you have the proper control over him to avoid the consistant rain(and I use that litterally) of objects that will invariably kill you repeatedly. The levels while having different back drops still all use the same stop mechanic ie: an old naval ship cannon behind a wall. This game not only hurts Microsofts brand but assures us that D3 has a LONG way to go before it understands what quality is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garbage, i give it back to the store as soon as i tested it. Frame rate is horrible, graphics are ugly and low res, story is boring and childish, and that auto aim is insulting. Trash 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Esse jogo só não é mais porco que Solbrain Knight of Darkness. Jogo fraco, combate fraco, movimentação e física de gen passada, bem robótica, parece MMORPG. Motor de jogo bem ultrapassado.
Keiji Inafune e os produtores de megaman/metroid trabalharam nessa porcaria, que decepção. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

MEU DEUS DO CÉU! Onde o povo da Microsoft estava com a cabeça pra investir nesse jogo?

A animação da personagem é horrível, a performance do jogo é terrível e você vence os bosses sempre do mesmo jeito. Faltou polimento, faltou criatividade e faltou direção. Mais uma vez o Inafune decepciona. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game was utterly boring, stupid, actionless, and easy, and I swear the last level made me go to sleep. Don't recommend: wasted $25 of my birthday $, and now I know why it's $25. This game sux. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very linear platform game. You have 3 characters and you can switch between them. The whole presmise of the game is to encounter an obstacle in front of an important item, then one of the kids comes up with an idea using different obscure household items as a new invention to get around the obstacle to get their item. It's this pattern all the way through. They use voice acting directly from the movie. I got tired of it relatively quickly. This game wasn't for me 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game determined to like it because of the visual style and to support a developer trying something different. Bad move. At first you'll be wishing the game had a fast forward button as Sofi trudges along, by a dozen levels in the game has you hopping madly across scattered floating blocks over top of a pit of death while giving you completely random and oh-so-often useless tools to work with. Absolute frustration and buyers remorse quickly followed. A truly terribly designed game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Though there are 1000s of puzzles, and even more to Download, the graphics are mediocre at best and, as for the sounds, I played it with the sound turned OFF. Most irritating was the "please wait" message that keeps popping up every minute or so that totally wrecks your concentration. The feature where you can "customize the backgrounds" DOES NOT WORK. This feature is advertised on the box and on the website. Tech support was useless on both of these issues - apparently, they consider changing the backgrounds a "game play" issue (?!) and could offer me no solutions or even a direction to get this solved. Unless you are a hardcore Sudoku freak I would say that this one is definately a no go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Until the bugs are fixed this product is unusable. Seeing as the "Please Wait" bug has been known for over four months now, why is the product still on the store shelves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First and foremost, the load times are amazingly long. Loading into a game took FOREVER, but the load times for all areas of the game are just too long. Otherwise, the graphics look blurry/washed out, especially when compared to other versions of the game. This is to be expected a bit, I suppose considering the Switch it the least powerful of the systems. As far as gameplay goes the shooting mechanic makes no sense. You're supposed to somehow know the sweetspot for shooting, without any kind of hints or visual guide. 90% of my shots were either too early or too late, with no indication as to why. Makes for a very frustrating game. I feel this version of the game was rushed to be released at the same time as the other versions, when it's obvious it wasn't ready, especially with online play needing to be patched in, from what I understand. Wait on this one...maybe they'll fix it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It makes you nervous & crazy.

Looks like sh.t, plays like sh.t. Watch the movie, ignore this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its a patch not more.. the "story" contains of 10 sentences from eris, even dumber than the lines Dinklebot had..  and its about 35 minutes playtime with the exact same locations you had before plus some mini expansions to the game aka the bunker ras2 and the jovian complex which are both pretty tiny.. plus the extended temple of crota tube level..  the mission are all the same, go to end room, kill boss.. finished..
nothing new, no challenge. just grab your heavy and let it go..   finished.  PLUS it doesnt integrate with the curent game.. the speaker does not do anything, even afte killing the second god of the darkness..   no reaction, no response.. on top how can a studio be so stupid and put a shady dark character up the balcony in the blazing sunlight? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is nothing substantial from this DLC (Not Expansion) other than new exotic (normal) items and a Raid. Other than that its dull. The strikes are the same as any other strike... The story missions are laughably pointless. 2/10 in comparison to what an expansion should actually do. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm officially done with Destiny. I can't fathom why in 2014 we are being handed a game with the biggest capital investment of ANY game to date that has less content then a private indie developed game. The base game had NO content, NO Story, NO Replay, NO REAL competitive multiplayer experience so you would naturally think there would be some sort of admission of wrong-doing by bungie in the first exspansion. Well..there isn't. Bungie almost flaunts the fact that they only have to put out a few hours worth of content to warrant fanboys praise. The Dark Below is an unethical cash grab. Still NO story, NO new characters (if you think Eris is a character I honestly don't know what to say) and NO replay. There is one new enemy, recycled world zones, new "ships" (just a pretty overlay for your 3 minute long loading screen) Additionally, there's the new raid which has been beaten within 6 hours of the release. It would be wise of anyone who is involved with this franchise to view the debriefing of an insider dev. that was released on reddit. The dev. goes on to say that most of the game was cut prior to release due to turbulence in the company, including, most of the story. How can a company who values its fans release this game for $60, and then release an exspansion (which is all content that should have been in the base game) and charge an additional $20? Bungie needs to answer for the blatant consumer misleading and rectify this trainwreck of a game or they will easily take the crown that EA games so shamefully wears. And before anyone disregards this review as an attempt at bottoming the review score please realize I have put 270 hours into this game and have already CLEARED The Dark Below. I feel like as a fellow gamer I have to let the community I love know that this game is not worth the investment you will put in it, even if its only a few hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to get this off my chest. BUNGIE what the #@ck are you guys doing. Deej you say you listen to the fans. Funny, i never heard any of the fans ask for CRAP!!! 20 dollars for a glorified Vendor. 3 story missions in which when your done you find out that you have to do 4 bounties just to unlock the weekly and daily. This is the last straw, i'm done with this game. I deleted it right after this. 10 year plan my ass!! you can't even last longer than 3 months without pissing off your consumers. Don't buy this if haven't. Save your money. Buy anything else that is not made by Bungie or Activision. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This expansion DLC is nothing more than re-used content, 3 short "story" missions, and little more that is not worth the ridiculous price of 19£... Bungie lost it respect for the fans. Shame on you Bungie. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Dark Below makes the exact same mistakes as Destiny, only with poorer production values.  The one good thing about The Dark Below is the inclusion of a second raid.  Crota's End is not as fun as The Vault of Glass, but it does provide some variety in 6 player PVE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

3 stories with no content. In order to find out more about Eris i had to go on Bungie.net and read what little there was on the stupid Grimoire cards(and why does she have 3 eyes?? Only the geniuses at Bungie knows) After you beat the 3 dlc missions which were clearly cut from the original game and resold as a cash grab. Bungie makes you run around recycled zone doing bounties before you can even play the new strike. I brought the season pass just because of Bungie's name alone, but looks like Bungie is nothing more but a name and a shell of it former self after they left M$. Come to find out alot of the original Bungie crew that created great games like Halo stayed behind at Microsoft or just left and went else where. I mean really how can you fan boys defend such a crap of a game???  This is easily my worst game of 2014 along with Rambo the game and Elder scrolls online. This DLC is a insult to gamers who value their hard earned money!! Really Bungie?? A boss battle where you battle a Crystal?? Wow!! I will Never and i mean NEVER buy other Bungie game again!! This DLC was Horrible. Period 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is DLC, not an expansion. No new planets, no new abilities, no new game modes. What you get is handful of uninspired levels, unimaginative game design, some new gear among many re-skinned ones, and an even more constipated leveling system, making your experience even less rewarding than before. This is to add forced "value" to their lacking content, by making you play hundreds of hours so you level cap. It's the kind of un-fun grinding F2P games use to make you pay extra not to do (except in this case, you are paying to do it). The crown jewel of the DLC, the raid "Crota's End" is still locked to many who purchased it because the developers stubbornly refuse to add matchmaking, to compensate for the difficulty to socialize through the game. You still have to get out of the game to learn key story points, and to find raid players in most occasions. The loot system is still dumb luck, with emphasis on the word "dumb". On a fair note, the PvP maps are decent, making you wonder if a straight FPS is what the developers would have done. The whole experience is frustrating, disappointing, irritating, and only suitable for hardcore fans. The Xbox version of this "expansion" would get a 0/0. Destiny has taken a turn for the worse, and doesn't seem like there will be a change of direction any time soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot, in good faith, give this anything higher than a 2. For all of October and November, Bungie made lots of claims that they had listened to their community on common issues. Bungie even took to Eurogamer, claiming that The Dark Below would offer a much more engrossing story with more player involvement. These claims turned out to be little more than smoke and mirrors.

The "story" is just as mediocre and head-scratching as the original only instead of Ghost directing the player what to do, we have Eris. The story design itself is a reskin of September's "Queen's Wrath" event where everything is tied to the bounty system with a separate NPC, separate faction, and separate rewards tree. Outside of the raid itself there are only TWO legitimately new area opened to players (Seraphim Vault, Hall of Darkness [inside Temple of Crota]) while the rest of the story missions take place on the same maps we've played to death. Even more egregious is the fact that players are forced to return to the Tower between nearly every stage of the new story arc; this flies in the face of Bungie's claims that they've listened to the community as most of the community has complained copiously about the sheer amount of time we're forced to return to the Tower and suffer through multiple load times.

The new strikes are the same "go here, press button, defend against waves" design and the Playstation "exclusive" strike is literally nothing more than fighting from the end of the Black Garden story mission back to the beginning while pausing to kill waves of Vex.

Like MMO expansions, new loot has relegated old loot to the dustbin - with exception to exotic items that can be expensively upgraded - but unlike MMO expansions this one hit a mere 3 months into the game's lifespan. In typical MMOs such gear destroying EXPANSIONS are on 12-24 month cycles.

Speaking of "expansion", The Dark Below actually CONTRACTS the game by removing previous vendor gear and blocking out non-DLC players from content updates Bungie had made in months prior. For example, Bungie added Cryptarch Engrams to the Vanguard Tiger playlist as a way to incentivize play. With the DLC, this has been moved to a DLC only playlist, so anyone without the DLC are back to the same issues the game had back in September. Likewise, the Hive-based DLC strike is added to the weekly rotation and will occasionally lock out non-DLC players from weekly and nightfall strikes (the latter of which was ALSO upgraded to level 30, also making it far more difficult for non-DLC owners to complete, even when it's not a DLC strike).

For the hardcore, this game penalizes them by significantly invalidating time spent in the base game. For the casual, the added currencies and increased grind have all but ensured that they're left behind if they can't spend 4-8 hours (or more) a day behind the game. Not worth $20 base or the expansion pass cost. Having purchased the limited edition, I had hoped they would address some of these issues but, instead, I'm left with severe buyer's remorse. Meanwhile, the vast majority of my friend's list are off playing everything BUT Destiny and my former 70+ strong Playstation Destiny Clan are now split between GTA Online, Far Cry 4, and The Crew. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aside from the visuals and sound effects, this is yet another disappointment from Bungie. Other studios in the past have been accused (unfairly, in most instances) of giving in to the purely commercial demands of publishers. What is clear with Bungie and their deformed offspring, Destiny, is that there really is no worry of exaggeration on this front. From day one, Destiny has been nothing other than a well calculated marketing strategy masquerading as a game and The Dark Below has continued this very dubious tradition. This game easily represents everything that is wrong with the video game industry. In some cases, poorly developed formal narratives can be excused when suitable and engaging ludonarratives are encouraged and celebrated. Destiny does neither of these things, aside from creating a set of "big-bads" and offering the player abstruse rationalizations for what they are doing. The Dark Below only continues this embarrassing pattern. In short, I expect that like myself, many gamers very much regret their purchase and doubly for those who opted into the DLC. After playing this game and setting it beside Halo, one cannot help but wonder if the magic of the previous series had everything to do with Microsoft, and absolutely nothing to do with this seemingly highly overrated design studio. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bungie is charging way too much for this DLC it should cost $10 tops. It brings nothing new to the table. The "new" missions take you once more through the same levels… but wait says Bungie; this time you start at the end of the level and make your way through to the beginning.

Just when I thought the bounties couldn't be more annoying and boring, "Erin" comes up and gives us another round of tedious bounties. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fantastic game mechanisms of Destiny are still in tact. But in terms of content added versus price paid, I am seriously dissapointed with this DLC. Same maps, same enemies, superficial overlay story where most cinematic content was release pre-release. New grind nulling past progress. Uninteresting bounties. For someone who is unable to plan life much ahead with 5 other people at right levels, raid is not interesting but seems to be main real addition. I rely on match making like so many others and don't want to go to web sites to compensate manually for techniques that should be in the game already - randoms are randoms no matter if I find them on community sites or via match making. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another rip-off product by Bungie. The three story missions are lame and short, the strikes are no better. The raid is alright, the only positive here. Overall, would not recommend anyone buy this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first expansion left me the same way the base game left me, wondering what are we doing here? The story is extremely bland and does require you if you want to understand the story to use the grimoire which is no way an acceptable means o tell a story. The game does look nice but you are revisiting a lot of the areas that are already in the base game just filled with more hive mobs with the 1 new character model that I seen. I wanted destiny to try and bring me back into the story but it seems as I'm being pushed back out constantly asking whats this? why is that there? who is this dude?. I would personally avoid this just for the fact that its disgusting they call this an "expansion pack" or even dlc to that matter as there is barely anything that will grip you to the game. To me destiny is a lost cause, destroyed by horrible methods..I have the next expansion due to my pass but I have no hopes for that either from what I have seen  2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not an "expansion", it is a map pack at best, and not even a good one.
I liked Destiny, and gave it a more positive review than most.  This "expansion" on the other hand is absolute trash.  There is nothing new or "expanded" other than exotics that you will never earn, reskinned guns and gear that are more powerful than the now-inferior legendaries that you spent time leveling up, some Crucible maps that may or may not be in the game type rotations you want to play, and a Raid that is still unplayable unless you can con 5 friends into buying this expansion (still no matchmaking for any daily/weekly/nightfall/raid content).

There are no new enemy types, no new features, no new patrol areas, no new tilesets or planets or regions, still nothing at the Reef, still nothing at King's Watch, no new public event types, no new abilities or subclasses, no new Crucible modes, no new story ("go kill Hive" - out of the 3 new story missions, one is immediately deleted as soon as you play it the first time and cannot be replayed), no substance at all.  I'm having trouble figuring out this was supposed to be an "expansion."

Everything looks and feels exactly the same, mostly retreading old areas with old enemies.  Because of the near total lack of new content areas to explore, the only way Bungie could create a level 30+ experience was to raise the difficulty of all their EXISTING content to require level 30.  By raising the baseline difficulty of daily/weekly/nightfall/raid content, they force you to grind back up to exactly the same situation you were in before the Expansion, essentially negated any feeling of "expansion" even of your character, because you are going nowhere new seeing nothing new and feeling no more powerful or challenged than you did before.  The only thing that changed by raising the baseline difficulty and level cap by the exact same relative degree is that all your guns got left behind and are now worth less than they were before.  There are now expensive methods by which you can upgrade your previously maxed-out exotics, but your legendaries are now permanently underpowered.

That pretty much sums up this expansion - nothing expanded, but your character sank backwards into a mire of useless grind just to get back up to where you thought you were before.

This is not the expansion we hoped would redeem Destiny.  It is inexcusably terrible, and confirmation that this franchise is collapsing under its own failures to provide content and bizarre insistence on hamstringing the players at every turn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a terrible expansion, but tbh there is so little content its more dlc with a hefty price tag, I have been so disappointed all day playing it, absolutely no story again and I mean that literally, our old raid gear/iron banner gear is now useless you can now buy with marks stuff with higher light and it is all so poorly designed and I really do mean that it looks terrible, same as weapons they haven't updated old ones so they are now useless, the crucible feels really broken now and so unbalanced the infamous vex now feels very underpowered again, the maps are such a poor design quite often when reviving u will be put right in the middle of a fight just had it happen 4 times in a row nothing I could do about it, the raid feels rushed and nothings changed drop wise 5/6 people in my group got the new version of shards/energy all the way through, no gear or weapons it hasn't got the same epic feel as vault of glass,  the missions are ott bad, some bounties feel like there is more to them, the strike is ok but nothing special, just found out people who have not got the dlc are unable to do nightfall/weekly which is disgusting, all in all it feels rushed out like they had to meet a deadline and they are now showing their inexperience to the max when it comes to mmo type games, I would go as far as saying I did love this game but the dlc has spoilt it, the 2 score is also ignoring how overpriced it is, should really be a 1 but gameplay wise it scores 2 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I made the mistake of buying the Destiny Limited edition so I had this dlc already purchased. After 3 missions through the same areas killing the same enemies I get a quest from the new npc that requires me to wait 3 days just to buy an item. I quit playing right there and haven't touched the game since. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The DLC with its action packed strikes and the stunning environments that are absolutely stunning is a great outcome of Bungie's re-evaluated gaming objective. This expansion couldnt give more to us  in Destiny's current state. 9/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Clunky, frustrating, tedious. . .those are words you should not be thinking or saying about a game that is supposed to be "fun". My wife and I both have played this game together and were more annoyed than entertained. It is not fun to open 50 some barrels/containers in an area, each other you having to gather up the contents, and then fight a difficult boss where you die repeatedly and are expected to re-gather the container contents again every time (or pass them by). There is no way on the OnLive version to have a private game, so level 1 players can join your game and you have to repeatedly kick them. This is one of the most frustrating games we've played in a long time. And we both love the LOTR franchise. Our advice. . skip this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite disappointed in the game play for this game, the controls were easy yet for overall storyline this one dropped the ball. A total of 3 bosses were provided and this game can easily be beaten with 100% in less then 8 hours. The artwork kept with the classic Disney theme, but for a game that cost over $40, the game play should of been a lot longer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ea games have yet again hit a low mark with this game. Not only are the graphics from at least 2 generations behind current standards (comparable with GTA San Andreas), but the game is also, as is typical of all EA releases these days, completely unstable. I ensured I had the latest drivers from nVidia, and running a Quad core @ 3.0ghz, an 8800gtx and 4gb of RAM (average PC these days) and the game crashed to desktop after about 15 minutes, with my system reporting it as a driver issue. In the past 3 or 4 months I have purchased numerous games, and out of those, every single EA game has come packaged with issues. It seems EA games have become too big, and are focusing on quantity of release over quality. The other theory would be them focusing on console releases which leave developers with minimal time to attempt to focus on porting. As for the game itself, it is way behind the pack. The Don control was a nice idea, yet badly implemented and was put together in a shabby way. The cars handle very badly, and the AI of your henchmen are a disgrace. The gameplay is extremely repetetive and although enjoyable the first few times you take over a business, it quickly becomes boring. If you are waiting for a game of this style, then I'd wait for Mafia 2 (whenever it is actually released), and in the meantime maybe give even The Wheelman a try. At least that game is optimized for the PC, runs well and is more fun, even if not perfect, it's better than this pile of dog poop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor graphics, poor gameplay, poor story telling. Not worth your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Blarg. This is something to rent, or better yet avoid entirely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Warning DO NOT BUY.
As of now, the game is incomplete, lacking, bugged, badly programed and clearly not tested ONE MINUTE.

Your CAWs have no voices on the in-game events/scenes
.
As of now the voices areall messed up, Ma chao talked like a strong woman, Dong Zhuo like a little girl and CAW use random voices every time.

As every empire there are individual comand prompts for every of your officer, which in this game they completely ignore, you tell them to DEFEND X base or move to this point and the ignore it ,go rampaging a perfectly defended base and let themelves be captured in SECONDS.

Ther is a new "grand scheme/strategy" now, which requires two of your officers choosen at RANDOM to leave the battlefield for a minute or more, which is, so far worthless as the strenght of such stratagems damage/usefullness, BUT the fu#$% AI, your subordinates decideto ABUSE these ass stratagems, and they CHOOSE to dissappear two of your officers twice or three times IN A ROW, making near impossible enjoy your command of battle, plus, making things harder and stupidier.

This is the most quiet battlefields EVER, remember DW7 empires? cutscenes everywere you can see your CAW and others to chat, complimient each other, feast, battle and just chat, this time the battlefield is complete silence, no one is talking **** no one cares your 3k kills or base defence, no matter the strategy THERE ARE NO CUTSCENES for such plots, no cutscens of the amush, no cutscenes for being a ruler, no cutscenes for ANYTHING.

there is this "fatigue" system where if you or one of your officers battle too much they start loosing stats, great if done well,saddly it does NOT.
there is NO indicator for how much fatigued you are, you just randomly loose stats.
The game says resting "cures" fatigue, but resting do not cures fatigue, it cures SOME fatigue, but ALAS there is no indicator of how much you are fatigued you cannot know when/how you will be OK.

Koei sold Unit creator as a big improvement, but is lacking as hell.
Creating a warhorse is ok if you somehow controlled who or when cavalry appears.
Createa banner is awesome indeed.
But man, create a soldier is lacking, you can only choosefrom the normal models:
Peseant, 5 types of soldiers (the usual) and the mages, thats it.
You can alter height, weight and colour palettes, done, no custom weapons, no increase strenght, no armor pieces or shields o fighting styles, just plain choose a clone.

Battlefields are a mess, the pathlines from base to base are so opaque that is confusing if theres is a way/path or it's just the line.
multiple objectives crowd and crample so tight, their flashing markings just get in the way and hide important parts of the map.

On-screen allies cannot be more braindead and weak as fu$"#.
On-screen allies seldom throw punches, and when they do they make for 1% of damage, they NEED 5 to 6 minutes for an officer to kill an archer and there are hundreds, THOUSANDS.

The game could be fun, but for now are the WORST $50 dollars spend so far in the year.
NOT RECOMENDED, not for new players, not for Veteran Warriors fans or Empires's.

Koei not only needs to fix the unplayable voices.
Koei need to make the game at least as DW7 with newer characters, bus as of now, new weapon schemes are NOT enough for making a new empire game.
Koe need to fix thisBROKEN UNPLAYABLE hacked off version of a game.

Good thing to remember DW7 Empires was abandoned and never patched, remember DW7 was left incomplete to it's luck, i made a terrible MISTAKE in buying this game as for now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Opinion review - This will be from my perspective, who has followed dynasty warriors since the very beggening. I discovered it one day, on a demo. I loved it, i scrounged up a bit of money and then rented it. I loved the idea of bieng a single man in a war, it was so immersive.

This was dynasty warriors 2, Little did i know i had previously played the first installment at my cousins place, so i was a big fan from then on. I religiously baught each game. until now tbh, despite my disapointments.

from 6 onward the series began to decline, but one thing you could always count on, was Empires.
Each empires installment ensured a challenge unlike any other, because of how sandboxy it was.

Chaos was nearly impossible, and required growth before you even started it.

Then 7 empires came along, the game was fun and all but with 7 and 8, the games got WAY easier, and it just became too focused on combos... why? this isnt a fighting game? well. im one of those that thinks elaborate mechanics trump combo play in fighting games anyway. but thats another subject entirely.

And while i say it was focused on combo's well, thats just a phrase im using, while combo's are a part of the game now, even that's undermined by how you can just slap a strong officer and kill him in one on the hardest difficulty. If you want a challenge, you have to find a very thin balance between your growth, and the difficulty you're playing. which let me tell you, isnt fun.

Objective review - My opinion aside =p

Dynasty warriors empires has certainly kept the franchise going for people like me, but the series has fallen alot since. 8 was actually a step forwards for a change, and this came with surprising challenges in a new form.

The game threw 8 officers at me at the same time once, now when you aren't strong enough to insta slap them, this got fun. I hadnt had as much fun since dynasty warriors online, when i used a X3 range ability to toy around with 8 players, forcing them all to run off. (fun stuff, but broken for other reasons, also another subject.)

Still, it wasnt like it used to be. 1v1 fights that the AI actually tested you, 2v1 fights if you got really good with that block. dynasty warriors 5 was the last time it felt like the AI could actually stand against you.

But four extreme legends had by far the most superior AI. yue ying... *shudder*

dynasty warriors 8 did right by adding the mystery to each level, it used to be red items and 5th weapons, you usually had to do some really cooky stuff within a battle to trigger events, which then triggered the appearance of those shiny red glowing beauties.

By adding that in the way of triggering a hypothetical storyline, refreshing the originality of the story, finally regained that sense of victory and satisfaction for completing each faction again. Not that pure historical is bad... its just not good on its own.

Extreme legends added even more to it, but all in all it remained the same.

when the empires installment arrived, well... the reason im talking about the franchise as a whole is because you can sum up dynasty warriors 8 empires so easily..

it's 7 empires. with the slight changes between the two games, but with less features. and less difficulty.

You can play chaos mode without any growth whatsoever. And its easy.

You cant make a difficulty HIGHER THAN HARD. easy. Im getting so tired of difficulty bieng ignored in games.

Resident evils Veteran mode is satisfying, and it goes two higher now, professional, no hope!.

RE5 professional ended up forcing me to memorise every single enemy in the entire game, it was great fun.

Chaos mode in dynasty warrior 3, actually saw me run out of time, in the one and only time i have ever used up the entire 2 hours it gives you, during He Fei castle. (ofc this is actually fighting the battle, and not rushing down the commander)

i have my theories, and have been told a theory, as to why the warriors franchise has gotten increasingly more and more insultingly easy as each installment is churned out. But aside from them, its just puzzling why they want to turn a battlefield, from an immersive expereance.

To just ignoring soldiers who stare at you the entire time.. Sure they did this in the older installments.. But not on chaos mode! Infact, to clarify.

Dynasty warriors 3 and 2, this was HARD mode. Chaos came after, and severely ramped up the difficulty.

it was amazing in four and five, standing against a massive army who wants to gobble up your commander, beside your best friend. Only your skill, wit, and stamina will win you the day.

And when you do end up victorious, that is a feeling that made these games a cut above the rest. Now? its like they've forgotton about their own game, and have forgotton what people like. I cant be the only one who has had those experiences? you know.. accidentally accepting a duel with Lu bu in DW4XL.... oops >_>

I want that feeling again. Lu bu right now is a chump. Just like the latest games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ouch. Disappointing gameplay to say the least. It is WAY too easy to hit home runs on any skill level, but the pitching is next to impossible when you raise the skill level all the way up. Also, there is no way to pinch hit for a pitcher and then keep that player in the game. The double switch option doesn't accomplish this and you can't switch the "pitcher's" defensive position making it impossible to let a pinch hitter remain in the game unless you do it ahead of the pinch hit. Stupid stupid stupid. I miss EA Sports. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Out of the three nba games out on the ps3 right now (NBA 2k8 and NBA live 08) this game has the lowest in sales with NBA 2k8 with the 2nd most then NBA live 08 with the most. it is sad that sony is trying to get money this way, why do you even try to go into battle vs 2k and EA. they are the best just like way back then when sony had game day that NFL game and they went up vs NFL 2k and Ea's Madden and what happend to that game sony lost tones of money and after three years they scrapted it. the graphics are the only thing that is going here for this wast of space. just get LIve 08 if you have a PS3. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Complete and terrible ripoff of Mark of the Ninja. Ubisoft take a rehashed and derivative game and then makes it even worse by applying it to a different genre. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

enjoyed it, stopped playing it and havent got back round to playing it again. if i shot someone in the head i'd expect them to go down. not turn around raise the alarm and shoot me. the controls and movements seem a bit jeky and not very fluid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I desperately wanted to like this game! Reiterating the comments of the first reviewer and countless other reviews I've read, the game is plagued with bugs. To the point where I was so confused because firing a gun at the target in your cross hairs didn't necessarily mean you were going to hit them. I had a lot of fun with the game in the tutorial where you are introduced to the RPG aspects of the game (which is the portion I was particularly interested in). There was so much potential here.Here's to hoping Sega can take this game and turn a sequel into a more polished experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Certainement la déception de l'année 2010 ! si la musique et l'interface sont remarquables, tout le reste est consternant... Farci de bugs, affublé d'animations ridicules, voix en anglais uniquement (au sous-titrage VF très mal géré), level design très médiocre, IA débile, scénario abscons, maniabilité moyenne, plutôt moche et en plus il rame énormément !... Alpha Protocol cumule décidément les tares. Ennui et lassitude s'installent rapidement : un terrible faux pas pour Obsidian que l'on espère le dernier tant ce studio a prouvé son talent jadis. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought this was going to be kind of like the superstar moses in Maddden or the MLB the show game but it was far more boring and less interactive.  Don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game has a lot of potential. Combat could be fun. Mount system and lots of dragons are good, and the housing system is spot on.
HOWEVER.
This game is complete garbage in two ways
First, the opening few hours are disgusting. 100%. They are so slow, boring, endless cutscenes with lip-syncing that I would expect from a PS1 game and the subtitles do not math the voices.
Speaking of PS1 games, put the game on the lowest settings and you'll see what I mean. Anything that's nearing the middle-range of your vision begins to move at a few frames per second, so a character will move a good distance and have taken two steps, and that is just not acceptable for a game being released in 2013, even on lowest settings.
On highest settings, however, the game still looks like it's something out of 2008 and yet is ridiculously hardware intensive for how bad it looks.
2/10, painful to play 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gotta say when i got into this game it was great. Great idea and liked that most market items were avail doing in game quests. Liked the idea of guilds and guild hosing but needs alot of work.

Reason i score this game is negetively is for the performance issues this game has with mainly Nvidia and Intel graphics users. First time i tried this game i could not play, just kept crashing. Few months later tried again and same thing then took me almost 2 days to find a older driver that worked. Even on release it was not stable, release had low med and high gfx and almost no difference between the 3. gtx 570 drop to 6 fps.

When on live stream with one the main people from SOE Rodd when complaining about perfomance to my question "why they adding and worrying about focusing on large scale PvP when 80% of players are having frame rate issues" his response was its the devs of the game and nothing they can do but focus on things they can change like the large scale pvp. They only care about the people who can play the game. like wouldnt it make sense to make the game more enjoyable to all before they add big PvP battles.

Game is focused on adding things opposed to performance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All you have to do is lob the ball once or twice before shooting and you can practically drill it from any distance. If only they fixed that, this game might have been fantastic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

another p2w fps with bad controlls no smooth move lagging server  op weapons vs new player with junk weapons   generic sound effect i dont even hear music  plus u pay  u get the best weapons best scopes this games can be  usefull only for the cold winter nights to smash your pc and make u so angry from lag service no thank you i can play  quake enemy territory or wolfenstein castle  with more fun than this 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fancy is okay, but the implementation is terrible. The graphics is too old, some sounds and musics is sucks. There are a lot of bugs. Bad story, monoton, boring. The AI is one of the worst in games history (maybe the Sniper: Ghost Warrior is the worst which i played). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cant say that i have tried the game, but the summary of what the game is alone makes me want to refuse trying it. For the past 5-6 years companies have been taking real time events and horrible twisting them to more interesting, but completely unreal plots. You want to tell me how this game has walking tanks, rocket launchers, and crazy undead creatures in a World war 1 setting? We shouldnt be reminding ourselves about these events with untrue facts, and thats exactly what games like this are doing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The controls are too complicated, they shud just try and make it simple like the first fifa street. Too much messing around on rule the street, keep it simple!. Overall really really disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game seems to run on a really low fixed frame rate, which makes it really unpleasant to play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game for my mother as a gift for Christmas, being that she is a huge fan of Cranium games and is also recently grown fond of the Wii. Christmas day we sat down to play and we were all dissapointed in it. The game itself *tries* so very hard to capture what makes its tabletop predecessor so fun, but fails miserably. The controls were frustrating, and at times completely broken. There is far too much animation and unnecessary dead time between rounds, which leaves people sitting back staring at the screen dumbfounded. This is a game that is much better left on the table, and off of the LCD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hydrophobia Prophecy serves as a stunning example of how *not* to make a game.  The controls are unresponsive and cumbersome; at one point, I solved a puzzle on accident because the action bindings are so ambiguous that my attempt to do something completely different caused me to perform the correct action.  The camera control is equally cumbersome; an early jump puzzle forced me to reload because the camera swung 180 degrees without warning, causing me to leap to my death instead of to safety.  The voice acting is awful; the main character can't seem to decide what sort of accent she has, being vaguely Irish most of the time but dancing through Scottist and various flavors of American and Australian, and sounding like a shrieking harpy the whole time to boot.  Scoot is a bland stock character, no more and no less.  The setting is actually pretty neat, and most of the time I spent playing was to dig up more details on the Queen of the World and the Population Flood.  The villains detract from this severely, as they are too cartoonishly evil to be taken seriously;. To whit, the game's setting is struggling with feeding a severely overpopulated earth. The game takes place on the eve of the unveiling a new technology that could feed the masses, ending the crisis.  The villains of the story want to use that technology to kill off the masses, as an extreme way to end the crisis--that just letting the technology work properly would also accomplish, minus about six billions deaths.  In summation, I bought this game on sale for about two dollars, and feel that I didn't get my money's worth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was boring for me after playing a hour.
And the Dub, this dub was very bad.
But he only good thing are the water physics and graphics.
I am fortunately, because this Game, was in a Steam-Offer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sin duda, se nota que tenían algunas ideas buenas y otras bastantes malas y, lamentablemente, ni las buenas están bien llevadas a cabo.

Podrían haber aprovechado de un montón de maneras el agua, pero en ningún momento te sientes impotente frente a ella, lo único que sientes es que es muy chula, y que probablemente sea el agua que mejor fluya en ningún videojuego, pero quitando eso...

La historia es interesante, pero está contada de la peor manera posible, quitando todo interés en saber sobre ella.

La mezcla de plataformas y shooter está muy mal hecha, parecen dos juegos distintos, por no decir que ambos son bastante repetitivos y no aprovechan para nada sus posibilidades.

Un juego que sin duda podría haber sido mucho mas de lo que es, y que por el final tan brusco que tiene, deduzco que tuvieron problemas con el desarrollo del juego. Aun así, considero que es un juego bastante malo, y no puedo recomendar su compra para nada. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just horrible. I feel like I'm playing a game back in 1995 when I play this game, Just horrible. Should have known not to listen to the critics and buy this sorry game on steam, now I'm out of 30 bucks and stuck with a worthless waste of space on my hard drive. At leased I've have a 30 dollar coaster if i bought it from a retailer, that or I'd have a pretty good shot at being about to return this junk game. Just a Garbage title, don't waste your time and for God sacks read the user reviews before you buy and not the critics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not as fun as most other games, especially Going Commando. Co-op is the only way to win, and the game throws hell. Just play Deadlocked, which comes for free with this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not buy this game! Worst Ratchet & Clank ever! Don't be fooled by the positive reviews about graphics and certain gameplay features. This game does not give you a fighting chance. You run out of ammo too quick. You tend to be more outnumbered by opponents, certain opponents are frustratingly stronger than in other ratchet and clank games. Health (nanotech) is less plentiful. And to top it all off, if you kill off most of the enemies in any given area but are almost out of health, then leave the area to go get health, all of the enemies respawn!! The auto-targeting doesn't work. How about jumping to improve your chances of not getting hit (like in other Ratchet & clank games)? Nope! You still get hit just as much. How about strafing... (lateral movement), against most enemies (who ironically seem to have auto-targeting against this defense), it makes little or no difference. Every strategy you come up with is negatated by the a.i.'s gameplay. I don't know what the multiplayer is like, but as far as the one player campaign... it's as if some programmer decided to prank punk everybody by negating every skill and strategy developed or used by ratchet and clank players over the past 10 years. I give it a 2 because it still holds true to the R&C experience, as far as gadgets, environments, characters, etc. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been playing every R&C since the first one got released, and i've never been dissapointed, not before now. First of all there's no big diffrence in the maps. There is 5 lvls (only 3 diffrent planets are used) and in 4 of them the princip is the same. Activate something, and then protect your generators. And this makes me feel like they have been too lazy while making this game. Also there is pretty much nothing new introduced, expect defences you can buy for your generators.
This made me a little sad, but thats not even the worst part. These maps are estimated to take 20-40 minutes each, which means that you can finish the game in about 3 god damn hours. That is surely the shortes R&C i've ever played...
The game also has some cool stuff, but i don't feel like it offers anything the other R&C's doesn't have. But oh well, i just finished it, and got pretty mad when i realized how short the game was, so maybe i'll change my score when i calm a little down, i dunno yet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game doesn't have any real strategy behind it and its just create a bunch of guys and attack the computer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is that people continue buying Ubisoft games?. The Crew has a terrible story (not that you buy a racing game for its plot), outdated graphics (almost PS2 quality) and a plethora of glitches that will keep you raging for hours.

Please vote with your wallet and stop supporting Ubisoft. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The next flop.
What is handed in with AC Unity was highly embarrassing.
Oh this work promises the quality that you might think of the trailers.
A dreary arcade racing game that has an on coercion. The car control is horrible. Worth less than 60 €. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Save your money. Its like they copied need 4 speed carbon from 2006 but with worse car control and stupid pop-ups that cause you to crash because you cant see the road. Seriously a let down. I looked forward to getting The Crew for Christmas and then the hype all fell apart. Poor car customization,  bad driving physics and stale game play. The main character is boring and lacks any real drive or motivation. Even his Revenge is lost in a clumsy game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I use to like this game alot, but instead they slap on $40 price tag for wild run that should of been a free dlc, and same with the other one releasing this year 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let's play a game: Never Have I Ever.

Never have I ever... Had to look up a walk through guide to see where I needed to go right at the opening seconds of a game.
Never have I ever... Could not read an in-game map
Never have I ever... Watched trailers and game play of a game, liked what I saw, bought it, and then upon playing it for a little, absolutely hated it.

Even with a patch released to fix bugs and issues, the game is technically lacking big time. Massive frame rate drops, a ton of major freezes that lasted a few seconds before the game resumed, terribly short draw distances and audio dropping. Game play wise, the map is hard to read (when I saw hard, I mean impossible unless you're a cartographer), compass is impossible to use as it doesn't function like a normal compass, instead showing you where the last camp you found was. There are wooden spikes in the ground serving as traps to those who aren't looking where you're going, but most of these traps are hidden under snow. Even if you are looking where you're going, you're gonna find and die in one of these hidden traps. The creatures in the game are awfully placed, most of the time they'll turn a corner behind you and kill you from there even though you could not have known it was there (since there are no music or visual clues that something is right behind you). You have to constantly check behind you, which is a pain because it makes progressing slow, and causes the game even more frame rate issues with the constant turning of the camera.

Environment is pretty well done, the mountains and trees are quite detailed... Until you get real close and see that trees are paper thin and reminiscent of PS2-game trees. Ledges and cliffs are hard to navigate because sometimes where you need to climb up or down is impossible to tell, or (when climbing down) you die after dropping a couple feet because "That's not a way you're supposed to be able to go *wages finger*." Save points are so few and far between, that if you die, you most likely have to replay between 10-30 minutes of the game again just to get to where you died........... Only to die again because the game is poorly designed.

Repetitive deaths in the same locations, combined with insanely infrequent save points make playing this game your own nightmare. So if the game wanted to create a nightmarish experience, it's done a fantastic job. If the game wanted to create a GOOD nightmarish experience, it falls right on its face, breaks its nose and runs out into the snow storm, left alone to either bleed our or freeze to death with its fate left a mystery.

PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME

Absolutely terrible game! Don't get me wrong. I'm not one of crazy F1 fans who hates NASCAR. It's just the game... It's just a silly arcade game with good graphics. 10 years old game  "NASCAR Racing 2003 season"  is still better than this.
First of all, AI is terrible and it crashes all the time.
Secondly the physics are so unrealistic and forgiving  Making a 180mph turn in Atlanta/Chartlotte with full throttle? Sure, why not... still without spinning the car. Of course I'm talking about "realistic" mode with all aids turned off.

There are only two cool things about it when we compare "NASCAR: The Game 2013" to NASCAR Racing 2003 season  Career mode and proper rules like: GWC finish, double-file restarts and so on.

To sum up, don't buy it. Play NR2003 or iRacing if you like racing online. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hoped for a great nascar game but we received a piece of junk that will fast be forgotten. I bought this on sale just when 2014 was released, so for 4.99 $ i wasn't ruined. Well I love Nascar and been playing a lot of seasons on NR2003 and been playing on Iracing... but I miss careers So I hoped for a bit of joy....... wrong very wrong... The game is just undrivable, I have tried for hours finding a good wheel g25 setup without success to have a good feeling, but i insisted and tried to get used to bad driving. So I went to my first Race, Daytona. I use 0 assists and was able to qualify as 1st! Great so the race started... Euh no Pace Car, no green flag adrenaline? The computer have control and release you on the line and then comes the worst You are in pole but your car seems sooooooo slow that they all catch you and don't seem to care  a lot you are there so they bump you all sides and you crash. So you star 43th from pole....

Ok my race is set to 50% of real time so 100 laps I managed to do 60 laps in a row and was 1st again! (that would never happen in real life) after a pitstop (well there is none the computer controls it again, and it's horrible) but then by passing a slow car he hits me and create an accident (pretty bad to my car) but no problem my car restarts 15th! 15th? why? you don't know because while you are crashing it suddenly cuts the action and you are in restart line. In the restarts they crashed me 3 times. I did repairs and restarted 43th again. 2 laps from the end i am 2nd again! (yeah jimmy looks like trash compared to my driving skill :) ) an what happened again another idiot ai crashed me again, and restarted 41st I was able to finish 38 in the 2 last laps. I was disgusted by the way things went. But I went to phoenix, and there my car barely can brake and handling get's absolutely impossible. So stop i give up keep your crap and I will replay 2003 with mods. 10 years and not one freaking descent Nascar game I am amazed.

Oh and by the way where are the Truck? where are the Bush series? at least in Nascar 2009 they had that and was playable even if it was to arcade. And then they hope to sell you some dlc's with paints... really? how about making a playable game, pitting, pace car, no auto start, Trucks and bush series.... nope Paints at 5,99, it says all about the devs! and 2014 is what a patch from 2013 at full price... Great great attitude!

The only positive thing is the career mode with sponsors an so on but not being able to go far enough to enjoy it. The game is an overall frustration. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game lacks both the realism to be a simulator and the intensity and fun to be a good game.

The graphics don't look very good for 2013, they look like 2007 (give or take) graphics.
The gameplay is just about getting a better car and hit the accelerator, if you choose any other difficulty than the hardest it won't be a hard game, but the hardest mode is just impossible to compete at the start of the career.
The racing usually goes into a dull car train, no crashes, no cars trying maneuvers, just driving around a track at max speed, really boring.
The crash physics are astonishing bad both realistically and graphically, I mean, if you cant make a good racing game, at least give us some eye candy. I chosen full damage options, even then I stop my car in the middle of the track, I get a car to slam into me at 300km/h and the damage on my car was a partially damaged frontal suspension... seriously? seriously? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not much of an improvement from the last. Awful mech game. Mech Warrior what armored core is trying to be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Armored Core For Answer is a terrible and frustrating mech game.

The game is stupidly difficult,and with the awful controls,is a recipe for disaster.

The graphics and mech customisation are decent,but terrible load times hinder the game.

But you should not play this game,as the gameplay is terrible.

DO NOT BUY 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My biggest Dissapointment of 2006. I was a huge fan of Phantasy Star Online for DreamCast and clocked over 200 hours easily over the span of diffrent characters. This game however strays from the succsess of pso and takes the franchise in an abismall direction.The enviroments are uninspiring and the game play is stiff. The biggest down fall is its story mode. what was sonic team thinking ,the wretched character design, especially of the main character, and the voice acting.....HORRIBLE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why? I repeat, Why, is this game on the 360? The graphics are PS2, the game play is as boring as any game ive ever played. I cant understand why people play co-op online in the first place. These kind of games are simply for gamers who cant get friends in real life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hard to navigate, commands are too vague, hard to figure out voice chat and how to get missions. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is potential. I mean the characters are cool, the system is ok, the plot can be well extended and the world setting is fashionable. Now, it is far from mature. The graphic is awful, the gameplay is extremely boring. No wonder it is free, I have remembered the game.

SONY, invest your money into it!! I may back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is pretty bad to be honest. Poor graphics, levels all look similar, pay to win, poorly thought out controls. I love the idea of the Warframes but I'm not paying. They'd have been better off just selling this and removing the in game purchases. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow what a POS game. I have played need the need for speed series since High stakes which is from 1999. I loved Most Wanted and Carbon, because they made you feel awesome. True Undercover as those moments and the graphic look really cool. The two main problems that brought the score really down for me was this. One the story is way too short, i finished this game is 3 days without doing any side missions. So it is about maybe a total of 10 hours of gameplay, need for speed most wanted had at least 20-25 hours without doing the side missions. See the difference. The reason why it was so short too ties into my second reason. This game is way too easy. You can just put the pedal to the medal without even breaking crashing into stuff and you can still win about 90% of the time. In Most Wanted i am still having trouble to win races and it actually feels more satisfying to win. So in conclusion it is a cheap version of Most Wanted. You would be better off buying most wanted 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a two because I was able to get through it. Been a long time since I actually had to pull a game from my 360 and throw it across the room from terrible frustration. this game lacks a LOT but in general was one of the better NFS / EA titles. Most other NFS games are pure garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whoa! The NFS Series as fumbled a few times (Such as Porsche Unleashed on the PS1 and ProStreet), but not as BAD as Undercover.

I'm going to start with the good: Variety of cars, the police chases (to a certain extent), the soundtrack, and the size of the map.

The Bad: Literally everything else this game has to offer.

The story: It took me less than 3 days to complete, it doesn't make a lot of sense, transition between the story and the missions is non-existent, and the objectives in the missions are not explained at all. There was so much they could have done to make you work like an actual undercover cop, but it was dumbed down like a low-budget action film.

The graphics: they are UGLY. To be fair, I can understand EA's artistic choices trying to make the game feel like a Michael Bay film, but they made it look cartoon-ish. The warm colors of the environment with the cool colors of the sky just doesn't look good. In addition, the game takes place at either sunset or sunrise so you are constantly blinded by the sun and the fresh-rain effect on the roads makes the sun reflection even brighter and very difficult to see. Part of the map is programmed to change to sunset or sunrise depending on where you are. With that stated, there are moments where you literally (I'm not kidding you) seeing the sun moving across the sky! It just shows how physics in this game are not a simulated in any form which brings up the next BIG problem: the physics.

The physics in this game are the worst I have ever played in a driving game and I play mostly racing games. The "Heroic Driving Engine" is laughable. The cars turn on a dime, rarely need to tap on the break, and require no drifting or driving skills going around corners. You can literally make a clean turn with a Bugatti Veyron going 150+ MPH around a street corner without tapping the brakes. This is not realistic in any form! There are other stupid physics glitches in the game where the pursuit brakers have physics explosions. Example: knocking over a platform of pipes, instead of falling, they go shooting across the sky at 1,000+ miles per hour! Other glitches include cars barrel rolling while stationary, pursuit breakers destroying police cars nowhere near the falling object(s). Some of these glitches are in conjunction with the incredibly stupid AI that consists of slow racers, police pointlessly ramming everything, and literally smoking the AI on any race/ mission without any effort. There are so many little physics glitches here-and-there that I could go on forever on each one I have encountered. The lack of beta-testing clearly shows!

Although Tri-Cities Bay is the biggest city compared to Rockport and Palmont City from the last 2 NFS titles, this map looks the ugliest. Although some areas of the city are cool to explore, the graphics explained above with the textures leads to a very bland and lifeless city with spotty AI traffic, ugly low-resolution textures, and very little sense of depth, and large stretches of rural and coastal highways with no vegetation and only terrain with repeated textures. It literally looks incomplete (Like the rest of this game).

Other technical issues: The frame rate is all over the place at any given moment. Some areas the frame rate slows the game to a point where it is almost unplayable. There are moments where your player's car is going faster than the road loading ahead, literally stopping the game until the void in front of you loads the map. I have heard this is a bigger issue on the PC version, but I will never find out as I will would never poison my PC with this garbage of a program!

There is very little to explain about the races themselves as they are like the past NFS games, except the AI is painfully easy. Another questionable issue is that instead of having arrows blocking you from driving off a race, there are literally walls blocking multiple paths, but the AI traffic is programmed to literally drive through the them (Yay, another huge freaking glitch!). Why didn't EA put the arrows to allow traffic to properly drive through them? We will never know.

I understand EA was trying to create a 3rd title to expand the game/racing structure we had in Most Wanted (2005) and Carbon, but they screwed-up this game so badly I don't know how they could have sold this without embarrassment.

I have a theory about this game: the development time was supposedly 2 years on this title. During the first year of development, the recession happened where many companies like EA had to scale back their operations. I wouldn't be surprised if EA "cut" development of the game, told Black Box to finish whatever was complete so they could ship the game and make a profit as it would be too big of a loss to cancel the title. It clearly shows this game was incomplete. We will never know. All we know is we were given crappy glitches and incompleteness for a final product for 2008's installment of the NFS series.

Final score: 2! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game should have been sold as a Total Annihilation game. It is not C&C. It's not worth $49.95 and definitely not worth 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is not even RTS style like previous C&C games when I tried its betas. EA killed the series. C&C3 and its KW addon were the last good C&C games. Even the cutscenes were bad. :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i wish i could have been positive about Tiberium Twilight, but i can't.
the C&C series have always been a traditional RTS(simple build,train,command,conquer), but 4 breaks that formula in a bad way.
its okay if they want to try something else but they shouldn't use a well known series as a base for that.
the story is also far below par. people who know a bit of the Tiberium universe will probably find allot of loose ends in it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been a huge fan of Command and Conquer for many years, and own all the games. However, when they started to announce this game and it was discovered that base building had been removed I said "pass"I didn't buy the game till it was on sale on Steam for 5 dollars the other week, and I still think I paid to much. It is not even a C&C game. No bases and all about micro. For the last game in the series it was massively disappointing. Why after years of success would they alter the design so drastically. I have about 3 hours of play, and have no desire to play any more. If you were an uber micro person that always built minimal bases anyway you may enjoy the game. But if you are a macro player that just plays casually in Skirmish and used the game as your "offline" option, then this is not for you. Stick with C&C3 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I picked up this game for 5$.  I want my five dollars back.I think that that should set the tone for this review.  None of the elements from the Tiberium games are in the game.  No base building, no choosing your own play style, no actual strategy, simply build guys and throw them at the target until you are bored.The paper/rock/scissors type strength/weakness  system added needless non-intuitive complication.  For what it's worth, for the short time that I played the game, it looks like the graphics were good, the environments were interesting, and that the sound and music were of good quality.  It's really too bad that I have no intention of playing any further in the game to find out if the story was interesting.Here's hoping Bioware treats the C&C series like it should be.  Or that C&C5 will return to the previous gameplay style. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game takes what I, personally, loved most, and chucked it out the window. No more base-building, no more resource management. Just OK, HERE ARE YOUR GUYS AND SOME LITTLE BUILDINGS GO KILL THINGS. The only reason this is getting a 2 is because it looks good and at least kept the live-action cut scenes. That's all it really kept from previous titles. Don't buy this game if you were a fan of previous titles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Command and Conquer 4 is by far the worst in the series. Yeah the graphics were nice but that couldn't mask just how poor the game was. Crawlers are ok, heck Id rather have one instead of an MCV because of the lasers but having a "class" that limits what units you can use? Having no buildings? Unit caps? A earn-points-to-win system? Sorry but I'm going back to my old tactic of planting rigs everywhere back in C&C 3 or Spy and javelin APV tactic in RA3. Though saying this, the concept of the general ranks to unlock units In my opinion, was quite good and may have been a quite smart feature if the game itself had not been horrible.

Ps: Generals 2: A free game with a similar unlock system but buildings and no caps. Only problem I can see is micro transactions.

PPS: If EA had really wanted to they could have cut this game and restarted like other games. Still waiting for C&C: Renegade 2 and it's explanation of how the soviet union turned into NOD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think I see a typo in the title there the command and conquer part doesn't seem to fit correctly.

I actually got this game twice funny story
bought it brand new installed it started a game gave me a cute option to be attack defense or support im thinking ughm ok then selected one seen pop cap seen I couldn't really build bases like previous games and said well screw this not playing you no more so some may seen this as bias but theres more

went and got the ultimate collection which came with this garbage game again gave it a second chance graphics were well ok I suppose I think command and conquer 3 was tuned up a bit better especially how nice the tiberium fields looked and the ambience of the whole environment anyways enough about that so played it tried to give it a fair chance its user interface is changed for the worse I believe build style for the small handful of buildings similar to red alert 2 but worse (yes somehow over 10 years they made something worse that worked before) ontop of that it did not have a command and conquer feel to it felt like some cheap rip off like how flappy bird is to angry birds lol don't have much else to say that hasn't already been said by a angry crowd of 508 people

I would suggest look into a lot of gameplay for this game if it still somehow interests you maybe you may like it where most do not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is by far the worst Command and Conquer game that follows the Tiberium war to DATE, I heavily dis like the fact that you cannot build a base and you can only construct units from a single heavy walker and you have a little controlled zone, I just dont like it, its to controlling, you are very restricted on what you can do.

Its defiantly a real let down after Command and Conquer 3 Kane's Wrath, if you to play any of Tiberium war games, Play Cnc 3 and its expansion Kane's Wrath. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was a shameless cash in on the franchise on the part of EA with the developers being forced to change what was intended as a country-exclusive experiment into a game in its own right. It corrupts every single aspect of what is recognisable about Command and Conquer and has a twist ending that just does not work in any way, shape or form. They created a weird DotA clone with even less involvement than aforementioned game with none of the excitement or entertainment value of any of the previous games.

This ending to the series was not earned, well designed or properly executed and just shows EA up for how disrespectful of the very people they are marketing their games to are. If you find anyone who actually thinks this is a worthy finish to the series, immediately force them to play through every previous game until they see sense.

The only good thing I will say is that it provides a much needed variation on the standard "which side will you choose?" format, but even that is only a slightly positive thing to say, because it initially forces you into the position of a GDI member instead of fully exploring the possibilities of who you will side with and why?

Oh, and to everyone saying that change needs to be embraced, you need to recognise the difference between change and the complete redesign of something to the point where it ceases to follow a format that, whilst not perfect was certainly not broken in any way shape or form, and is instead a DotA/Dawn of War 2 rip-off. Furthermore, they've always been changing things here and there, but at the very core it has kept the same format of resource collection, force building and variation in unit types, with super weapons when you wanna be extra-nasty. Lastly: it's an old franchise which many people, including myself, would have grown up playing and are why we're hardcore gamers today. I was 6 when the first game came out and I played it way back then. People are going to be a little upset over a company saying "we couldn't care less about a franchise that is the core reason you're a returning customer and help keep us fed, we just want to turn out an ineffectual finalisation to something we have blatant disregard for". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An unfortunate shadow of its former self , no buildings , no real tiberium . Starting afresh may of worked for an off shoot of the tiberium canon but to change everything so significantly for the finale of an amazing trilogy is a slap in the face for all tiberium fans worldwide. I can only hope EA realise this and realise their next game with the old mechanics rather than use their loyal fan base a guinea pigs on a game very likely to fail. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

CQ4 Cannot be as bad as this, surely? Mandatory online registration (even as single player, having paid your money) to play a game that has NOTHING to do with the CQ franchise (except the pointless 'movies'). EA have reduced a strategic army-building-with-resources-and-defence to a run around the map with a squad (twelve units max, six typical... and this is CQ?) to some pointless sites, which you can neither defend nor retain--- because of course you're not allowed to build in CQ4 - or gather resources - or acquire an army - or combine defence, offence and air... or do anything like either a 'pseudo-real' army (combined ops with multiple units) or the original CQ franchise. Never has a game so destroyed a franchise - just as well it was the final one in the 'series'. EA has just lost my vote for RA3 (cartoon nonsense) and CQ4 (pointless squad rush - without the 'rational' gameplay of DOW). Sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has NOTHING to do with C&C. It would be a halfway decent game if it cost 10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A shamelessly exploitative game, EA have made no effort to accommodate for what was already a significant fan-base, it wouldn't surprise me if the direction they've taken C&C4 succeeds in alienating more people than it attracts. I can understand that the format was getting old (even though I personally still enjoyed it) and that some went so far as to consider it 'dated' - I could even understand it if they had changed the 'old' format in a way which was original and corresponded with the rest of the series. However, the way in which they have so blatantly ripped off Dawn of War and other RTS 'rivals' is unbelievable. I don't even really think that those sort of games are rivals, most of the people I know into strategy games play both, and for different reasons! To make things worse, the only redeeming features that this game actually has are the ones robbed from these other games, which leaves not much to praise in C&C4. I'm sorry Ea, but you've murdered and raped (in that order) a wonderful game. Be ashamed of yourselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gave this a 2 because of the colours Seriously, if your a C&C fanboy and loves to gather resources and enjoy watching your ranks of buzzers/ mammoth tanks / NOD troopers smash the opposition, DONT BUY THIS 50 points to spend on units, each unit is average 4 points. Gain EXP just so you can get the next unit even in a LAN environment, just not worth it. Why should i be punished for buying a game? this is not a RPG its an RTS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Far too small scale to be considered a real-time strategy game, this game makes a compelling case for a new genre, "Real-Time Tactical". If you are happy deploying no more than twelve vehicles at a time, then this is the game for you. The story line is weak and leaves alot to be desired, but the options given to the player to choose their future is very reminiscent of the early C&C titles. The handful of excellent features (such as the arsenal tab before every mission) are far outweighed by the tiny scope of the battles, the poor balance for the units, and the silly limitations placed upon the player by both command points and "crawlers". It is a sad end to the C&C series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst RTS i've ever played, no real strategy as your simply have to keep up or try to overwhelm your opponent by pumping out units faster. no base defense to speak of, extremely boring, sad end for one of my favorite franchises. utter failure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of those games where i wish i had never spent my money on. wasted 49 dollars on a game that had a bad story line, bad game play system (onless your a fan of it which im not) and a horible ending. it lacked the excitement and rush that you felt when you played the game. the log on system is also an issue, be expecting proplems if the server is down. graphic wise it was nice some items but nothing amazing, in fact some things didnt make sence like the nukes looked like small explosions instead of BIG BRIGHT explosions ill tell you this, i dont know what got into the people who made this game but it was just FINE as it was before this change. Im a fan of the c&c games and this is just a sad thing to see. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA ... Seriously? The game has been paired down so badly, it's no longer fun. C&C 3's gameplay had refinement and attention to detail and effort. This feels like Red Alert 3, rubbish. A small list of problems: - Animations *The Walker animations (you spin on the spot? but yet the mastedon correctly walks around) *Oversized and ugly air planes.... *Fat units. - The pacing of the combat feels too rushed..... everything fires at a thousand miles an hour or too slowly I've a long time fan of the C&C series, but this feels like it was made for small kids, the only saving grace is at least the acting and the cut scenes are better. Please get the management and original team who made C&C 3 back and sort this game out with a patch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game as a RTS is a terrible game, it requires very little strategy to play. I invested about 5 or 6 hours into playing this game and honestly want my money back. The game is nothing a C&C game should be, As a new franchise it could be quite respectable. However, the game is not a new franchise, it was advertised as a C&C4 game and it failed miserably. The game has no economy, very simplistic strategy and no lasting consequences to poor decisions. The extent of the strategy in this game is how fast can you change your queue of units to build the unit that counters the units used to counter your units. Since there is no cost for building units, there is no value on any unit you build. The game is a C&C game, and therefore there are certain elements people expect from the game, out of which non are present. The storyline is also a huge dissapointment, the missions are bland and simple and the storyline is just terrible. Kane has no evil left in him pretty much, he has just gone soft with age i guess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing like what the c&c should be...its quite pathetic how ea just manages to screw up one game after another, they should have ended this game like it was meant to end, fix the problems from the old style, fix the lan, fix the desyncing and just leave wat they had alone and just build on it, not come at it with a completely different design and interface, its a absolute disgrace to the series, it should have been canceled instead of releasing a complete and utter failure. and EA manages to screw up every game they pretty much touch, which screams either new management or new programmers, either way, EA needs to change the way they make and package their games together, because with all the new games coming out, this game, and bad company 2 and a few others, are terrible compared to Cod mwf2 and supcom 2 and starcraft 2. and wat could really be their excuse? low budget? yea right, a company that size with a trilogy that successful, gimme a break, id say i definitly feel cheated out of my money for c&c 4, and it just seems like with ea this happens more and more and more, no money put into the game, and the game still sells for 50 bones, just utter bull crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Again, EA prooved us that their influences on magnifiscent games like C & C and others is horrible, good way to destroy the series EA, awsome director and team, congradulation! Its too much expensive, maybe 9.99 would have been a bit too much, but not 49.99. The game is dangerous for those who got eyes problems, the scenario is horrible, the EA support contact is less than pathetic and the servers are simply not servers... Again, congradulation to EA and their team. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Congratulations EA on CnC's Big finale, a total Letdown. I can't believe that you ended a great franchise with a such boring story and the gameplay totally sucks, its like a copy of company of heroes and Dawn of War II. Sure the animations are awesome, but other than that everything is a complete disappointment. I am a CnC Fan and seeing this game makes me really sad to know that a great franchise had a really bad ending. It's just Disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Create a player sucks. You can't change batting stances so alot of the players stances look stupid and generic. The controls are ridiculous and stupid. 2K8 was great now they release this junk. I always loved what 2k did with baseball, until now. Its pathetic, I'm real upset by this release. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game came short of every expectation I had. There were huge flaws in the game. these include:missing theme music, small roster list and adventure mode. With the lack of these you would think that the game would make up for it in the C.A.W. mode but that is the biggest disapointment of them all. With very few costume, facial, logo and hair selection it leaves you with a bunch of clones. for the very few positives of this game is its graphics, somewhat updated roster and its match modes, which still don't compare to smackdown. on a final word this game isn't even a match for its n64 counter parts like no mercy and wrestlemania 2000(probably the best wrestling games ever). Unfortunetly this game defy's the laws of physics by actually managing to suck and blow at the same time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game should not have been released for PC. It's a game that looks, feels and runs like a mobile game.

The UI is extremely simplistic, clearly made for touchscreens (mobile devices), lacking in anything more in-depth. Graphics wise it's okay, for mobile devices, for PC graphics it's a complete joke. There are no real options to speak of, you can switch from windowed mode to windowed fullscreen and adjust audio options, that's it.

You'll most likely find yourself bored and uninspired after 30-45 minutes of gameplay. It's repetitive, too easy and not interesting in any way, shape or form.

I wouldn't recommend this game on PC to anyone, ever. Save your money for something else, anything,  as long as it isn't this game.

TL;DR - The only thing this game is good for, is to play a cruel joke on a friend, nothing else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad game, why you think, wel the first 3 times you play it the game is fun, then it gets boring, all the battles are the same and you have seen it all.

Winning and loosing is to unpredictable, one second you are with 35% of winning condition and the next round you have lost, without even having a change to do something against it.
What happens is that if you win a fight at a home world you get all the planets of that player, so in 2 battels you can get from 15% to 50+ and you have won the game, or if the AI does it you have lost and yes they do that a lot.

Building up an empire is useless since you will loose the game suddenly or just win it by taken 2 home worlds.

You might as well get your risk dice and if you roll a six you have won.

Its to bad because if they just put some more time in it the game would have been fun.

I realy would like to see somebody who gave it a score of 8 to do the review again after playing it 5 times  at a harder difficulty, i bet you think differend about the game then. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's basically Port Royale in Europe. It's very expansive and has a town building element much like that of Nobunaga's Ambition: Sphere of Influence. Other than that it lacks any real charm or memorable feel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After reading a lot of good things about this game I decided to give it a try and see if it matched up to all the hype.....

Pro's
1.It's fun at the start, hell everything is fun AT the start.
2.The graphics are pretty decent

Con's
1.Repetitive! So so repetitive! You do the same thing over and over and OVER! they try to mix it up with other things, like mini-games and having you pilot a sub and what not, but the game never changes.
2.The writing, at first you think it's funny, but then you realize that it gets less and less funny, and as the repetitiveness lowers your 5th grade humor level you laugh less and less.
3.The weapons, they give you about 8 or 9, but they really don't do anything new, the machine gun shoots lots of low end damage bullets, while the shot gun shoots a very large spread of bullets, I found my self using whatever I had at the moment most of the game.
4.Clues, more then once I sat there questioning what I was supposed to do, and would get nothing, so I would have to check the net.
5.Bugs, while I didn't find any but one, it was really an annoying one, when I would alt-tab out something would happen, and when I came back the music would die out, forcing me to restart the game.
6.The design of the game, while it was supposed to be like metroid  it ended up feeling boring and just not creative, I found my self rushing through levels just so I could get to the end boss and finish the damn game.
7.The combos, while at the start they seem really fun and cool, but there are about 10 that you do, and with over 100 boss's you see them over and over and you're unable to skip them, at the end of the game I couldn't stand watching them.
8.Story, The start of the story is fun, but like everything else in this game it drags on with out any kind of up date and you end up not caring about anything at all.

All in all I gave this game a 2/10 and not a 0 because it's cheap, and while I really didn't enjoy it someone else might., but I would suggest you wait tell it goes on sale because if you're like me after an hour of playing this you will question if it was even worth it.

This game is an abomination. The reason you continue to play through games is because they typically offer a series of rewards. While you can change hats, weapons, and skins for your "Wheel of Death," it all falls flat because the main focus of this game is spectacle. Ok music coupled with a messy background and constant movement of EVERYTHING make what you can and can't interact with a nebulous area; while odd hit-boxes and unskippable dialogue make the game infuriating. It can't decide if it wants you to slog through it all with a vast reservoir of health, or just instantly kill you with a slight misstep. I found the game to be infuriating as you can't do really anything without it stopping to zoom in on something, starting a conversation that usually amounts to drivel, or forcing you into a minigame that gives you a second to figure out the rules or instantly fails you. There was a huge amount of care that went into the animation and characters, but reused "boss" death animations and aesthetic changes that yield no impact detracted even from that. The quirky style and the death animations are REALLY the only thing different about this game, but some of them are odd in that they have no connection to the minigame you played for the animation to play and then they start to repeat. The story might as well not exist and the writing is on par with any Saturday morning cartoon that's on before the show you really want to watch.
If you're looking for a platformer, there are free ones that are better than this.
If you're looking for flashy action, Bayonetta is great.
If you're looking for something that might put you in a coma with how amazingly uninspired the game is, I wholeheartedly recommend Hell Yeah. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The pixel art style and the unique idea initially seem appealing, however what happens in reality is that you start the game, the first scene doesn't explain the game mechanics very well at all, you're trust straight into the game and then brutally raped over and over, the game doesn't let up, you can spend hours on the first scene trying to find the perfect combination of moves to exactly pass it, only Random Number Generation make some scenes LITERALLY impossible to complete. It's like Dark Souls but harder and less fair.

I literally cannot understand why the developers thought this was a good idea, I'd give this game a zero if it wasn't for a cool indie style. I would not recommend this game to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really not that good. It was advertised as a game where your choices were hard to decide due to morality. They're hard to decide because you don't want to fail and restart a chapter for the 50th time after playing it for 30 minutes (Yes, there are NO checkpoints).

My partner got torn into two in front of me (not a spoiler, you can prevent this), and emotionally in real life I didn't care at all. Neither did the main character, as represented by his bland dialogue. What I was thinking about though, was "Oh man, now that I can't split the damage I take between two characters, this will get so much harder."

That was why I cared of his death. I didn't care about him, his character, his children, his anything. I cared because I didn't want to lose.

Yet I did. 45 minutes of my life went down the drain. I went to try again, only to have to restart the mission entirely. 45 minutes of my time lost because of some RNG roll.

You know, games were short in a time when NES Cartridges simply were not large enough to allow games to be long, so they made them very difficult to extend game time. That's exactly what Gods Will Be Watching does. The developers knew their game was short, and instead of adding more interesting content, they simply made it insanely hard. Modern game design at its worst.

The art, animations, lighting, SFX, BGM were nice, but the design completely ruins it. Do not waste your time or money on this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

PROS: Fresh look for a good classic, resources or speciality services, shared goals within game, on line play.

CONS: DRM tech (for such a "unpopular" game, based on EA's preparedness level), SC Veterans will miss a single player mode, EA's support structure was not scaled appropriately for this games data/connection requirements and/or the demand thereof.

Im not sure what type of this latest title the Critics got a taste of, but I assure you, it wasn't the one that consumers beta tested or paid for.    Finally, with all that can go wrong(and has) with games that have gone this route, I'm not even sure if you can call this a game at this stage.....maybe software or program as a game is fundamentally redundant if it cannot be played and just merely stared at, in awestruck disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yesterday, I was able to play this single player game for maybe an hour before becoming disconnected from the server; waited in queues for 30 minutes at a time only have my queue restarted at the end of each 30 minutes. Middle of day 2, my region won't load. It goes without saying that the release of this game is a fiasco, but what is rightfully upsetting is that EA has broken very logical convention for a game of this type, and really gone out of its way to put its customers at risk of dealing with this inconvenience. If EA were a TV manufacturer, an airline, a pharmaceutical company....they would be issuing refunds right now. In the least case, they owe a very public apology to their customers who preordered or purchased before they had their servers working. As far as the DRM is concerned, I cannot imagine a poorer way to treat paying customers.
As for the actual gameplay that I was able to experience: If I had to sum it up in one word, unfortunately that word would be "lame".  Aside from the day one bugs, such as not being able to sell power to my partially-grown neighboring city, I was seriously let down by the abnormally anemic size of the cities and by the shallowed complexity as compared to SC4. I miss the graphs...they were the best way to show you how well you have done over time, and what elements changed in your SC4 city. The demand system is not doing well: I had half of the acreage of my city covered in middle-wealth families, a quarter in middle-wealth commercial, and a quarter in middle wealth manufacturing. What are the sims telling me? The residents say there are no jobs and not enough shopping. The shops say there are not enough potential employees or shoppers. The factories say there are not enough potential employees or "places to ship their goods", i.e, shops. So yeah, that is perhaps the most essential system in the game and it's currently half-baked. It is visually decent, but the animations are still buggy (i.e. sims jittering around as if possessed).
I believe it is completely fair to compare this game to SC4, particularly as the developers have spent plenty of time alluding to the connection between the two. At this moment in time, SC4 is hands-down a more challenging, more complex, and, without a doubt, more rewarding game. The multiplayer aspect was a bold diversion from the logical direction, and has thus far not only failed to add anything meaningfully positive but has made the game literally unplayable for the core market who preordered or purchased in the first days. Obviously, fixing this issue is priority one. Expanding the city size is priority two. These two glaring issues need to be fixed before we can pretend that this game is worth more than $20 (issue one needs to be fixed before this game is worth a penny!). I'm not sure we're ever going to see this game being worth the $60 that so many of us have paid.

I'm rating a zero, obviously, for the fact that on day two I still cannot play the game. If I were to pretend that I could play the game, I would give it a 3.5. Overall rating rounded up to 2.

To remake a lyric from Team America: "I miss you more than Electronic Arts missed the mark, when they made SimCity..." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This review is based on my personal experience with the game.  I pre-ordered the limited edition of the Sim City, however I wasn't able to actually start downloading the game until 8:00 the next morning.  Seems to defeat the purpose of pre-ordering.  After the game was installed, I was able to play for about 2 hours before I got a message saying the the SimCity servers were down, attempting to reconnect.  I don't care about the DRM, but when it effects my gameplay experience, it is unacceptable.  The 2 hours of game time I had were fun, but the game comes with so much baggage that it completely sucks the fun out of it.  I know that when I am able to play again I'm going to constantly have "SimCity servers are down, attempting to reconnect" in the back of my mind, and wondering how long I'll be able to play.  For a company as large as EA this is just ridiculous.  They have raised the price of their games, forced you to download Origin in order to play, and then shown complete disregard for their customers.  It is a fun game to play but I honestly cannot recommend purchasing it until EA straightens out its problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A great game marred by EA's always-online requirement and cloud saves.
1) Autosaving of cities are unclear  you do not know when your creations are saved. Crashing to desktop is almost a death sentence as your cities literally disappear or got rolled back to empty wilderness when you log back on. 2) Unable to join servers and therefore unable to play a product you payed for  unacceptable especially when no ETA on fixes are given. 3) If you idle in the join game selection lobby for abit (less than 1hr), after a while you cannot join/load.create any game  you get a failed loading message. It's as if they disconnected you from their servers without telling you. Other minor bugs are present but do not impact the game too much. Except traffic pathing AI perhaps.

Conclusion: Even if you can tolerate the online DRM, the potential loss of your  friends' creations upon disconnect/crash is enough to make you give up after 2-3 fresh retries. Don't buy this game until they work out this major problem (on saving cities and crash/disconnect recovery) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DRM, small map size, forced "social" gaming. I want to like this game so very badly, but those 3 things alone are almost enough for me to not want to pick up where I left off on my city.....ohhhh WAIT, no, I cant pick up because the servers wont let me right now. Thats right... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DRM kills this game, as the previous 1000+ people said.  Can't log into servers, always checking for updates. Terrible launch.  And now EA will not take a refund on the game.  Don't waste your hard earned cash on this company, and their bad products! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this is a shame. simcity is a good game. however, greed has got to EA. the game is expensive to buy, must be used online, and in reality  is nothing more that an online store for you to buy more and more DLC over the years. give this a miss  i could forgive it if the games were free. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes, this game is a lot of fun.  Yes, it's more user friendly than the old versions of SimCity, but what does that matter whenever their servers that you HAVE to use are down?  You can't play if that's the case and, surprise surprise, that's the case this morning on the -first- day of launch.  Hopefully this deplorable score will wake up EA to finally get their act together. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish I'd checked these reviews before I went out and bought this game, thinking SimCity would be great as it always has been. First off with DRM, this doesn't affect me so much as I really always have connection but if the EA servers fail I have paid £40 to do nothing. It's not a city builder, it's a small town builder. The sizes of the plots are ridiculously small. How can you build a city in a 2km by 2km grid?

What I was expecting was something along the lines of SimCity 4 but with new features/better graphics. There's a few new features but i'd say there's less features overall. Ea have taken out highways and subways and to build an airport you're going to have to destroy half of your "city"

Honestly so disappointed with this version of SimCity. Going to play SimCity 4 to try and recover from burning £40.

Don't buy...

Added review:

After 8 or so months i decided to come back to this game, still disappointed. If you look at their Facebook almost every comment is from people who want bigger maps. Surely the next update has to be bigger maps? no.  I don't understand why a game company would so blatantly ignore their fanbase. Surely they would actually make money from this?

To add to it when i patched i couldn't play because the server was unavailable... I think i'll take a point off my previous score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Inventive restructure of user interface, solid execution on how interactions "feel" in game. Social structure and communication of system needs is acceptable.  NOTHING SAVES YOUR CITY WHEN THE WATER IS GONE. Unless you happen to occupy an ocean or river connected tile for water supply (river resource runs out too) you need a solid seller of water to fuel alternative economic priorities than base industry. Tech industry is almost all water need. I tried to self supply, no hope there. Want my $70.00 and 12 hrs back now. Played it day of release... FAIL. A few days later, functional. Later that week, water mechanic kills off entire map.

I guess I could go play BattleFailed on servers run by abusive douches. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea of the Simcity is both got better and worse. The machine which controls the sims had big upgrades. However the massive engine caused other game performances to decrease. They weren't able to give the player the opportunity of choosing the building size. Also the new multiplayer gameplay shouldn't be necessary it should be optional. The idea of Simcity is making your own city not making someone others "TOWN" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst customer/producer communication ever. They get so much hate on facebook and streams.. i dont get it. The community wants bigger maps  offline mode and so on.. Hobby modder are able to creat things like that but maxis "is not able to"  Rly i dont get it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's actually quite surprising how truly bland and un-sim-like this game is. Going in I really thought the complaints of "the cities are too small" and "the simulations are too simple" were just the cries of EA haters and non-sim-enthusiasts complaining for the sake of complaining. The truth is, the haters are right. After an hour of playing, you'll feel like you've already seen and done pretty much everything there is to see, and you're unlikely to ever feel truly engaged. The game is cold and indifferent, moves at a snail's pace, but yet after about an hour you'll have most of the city plot filled up with stuff. There's just very little content, and even less reason to care. This game is a terrible let down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a modern version of the predecessors. I will start with 5 points, and then i will add or take off points.
Pro's:
1-The user interface is small and good. (+1 point)
2-The answer time in the servers are good. (+1 point)
3-The game has goals. Achievements. (+1 point)
4-Is addictive. (+2 points)
Con's
1-The lag is annoying. (-1 point)
2-The servers are full. (-1 point)
3-You can't skip the tutorial. (-1 point)
4-Too many updates, almost all days, the wait time is annoying. (-2 points)
5-Painted cardboard graphics. (-1 point)
6-2 square kilometers to build. (-2 points)

The game is very bad, not recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Summary and Veredict: Very poor game even after the forced online mode era gone once and for all. It is a case in point that shows graphics are not everything.

Modding might make this game much better with time (like it did for SC4) but considering EA right now appears to be not as friendly towards it as it was when SC4 was released (so they can release their overpriced DLCs in the first place), the crippled region play without terraforming and lack of creative control, all these factors but make this game very boring after a couple of hours of play.

Definitively not worth the 60$+ it cost at launch and still not the 20$ it costs right now unless you are a very casual player just looking to play town mayor with some pretty 3D graphics once in a while. If you want to go anywhere further in the field of city simulator use that money to get either SC4 or Cities XL.

Pros:

- Decent full 3D graphics.
- Roads can now be built curved, elevated, etc.
- Improved simulation of town's inhabitants. (may or may not be important depending on your style of play). Nice with the bus and ground rail transit options the game offers.
- Online mode can make for some fun moments with friends though this was already possible in SC4 in a slower and more cumbersome scale.
- Upgradeable buildings.

Cons: Pretty much everything else.

- Ridiculously small town sizes. More like small neighborhoods. In paper "2 x 2" km wide (or about 1.25 mi by 1.25 mi) but considering that roads take much more space than they used to in SC4 or in real life, the maps appear to be much more smaller than that. Using roads as reference, maps are about 0.5 km wide. So yea, the 2 x 2 km SC city has about 1/16th of the area of a medium tile city in SC4 (which is supposed to be 2 x 2 km wide as well) and 1/4th of the smallest cities in SC4 that are 1 km wide. There is a mod that increases their size a bit but with region and lag problems described below, use it at your own risk.
- The above would be not such a big deal if they were side by side like SC4 had but alas the towns are spread apart and there is nothing in between them but a few roads linking them together. After building your towns - which can be done in less than an hour easily in each town, and in a day or two in all towns inside a region - you are left with a terribly unrealistic looking region with packed squared shaped towns scattered in a region of blank space. You cannot even add extra city connections.
- Building sizes in contrast appear very small relative to the roads they border. Even SC4 had size scaling problems (roads and buildings) but yea, they go to a whole new level in SC.
- Cities can achieve populations similar to their counterparts in older games, but that just makes your cities appear even more unrealistic and silly than they are already appear to. For example, a 350k city would have 1.4 mil people per square kilometer in SC, using the size above, in SC4 medium city same population 56k, while the densest cities have about 100k to 20k.
- No ability to create new maps or even terraform whatsoever. Towns appear in the region locked in place and you cannot even change their location. So if you dislike that big hill or that piece of river bed inside your town or a new region altogether you are pretty much screwed.
- Curved roads create big spaces of wasted space, a very minor problem on its own but considering you do not have a lot of space to begin with, often you are left wondering why build them in the first place? Speaking of which no freeways or one way roads to begin with. Even gridded layouts have plenty of wasted space.
- Zone density way too simplified and is based off only on the type of road used to zone them, further stiffling creative control. Since buildings are based off the road they are beside at if you demolish the road you also end up demolishing the buildings... Everything has to be beside roads, even parks.
- No subways or agriculture. Not that they would fit in in 0.5 km wide towns anyway.
- Lag problems when your city gets more and more populated. Suddenly, trying to simulate 350k+ people on a game daily basis does not appear to be that enticing...
- The game was online mode only (for a game that screams single player over and over again) for over a year and had huge server issues in the first month or so after its release. While they bear no weight on how the game is right now after the offline patch it is outrageous that we had to wait a year for that to happen at all. Especially considering that they lied that this was impossible to begin with.
- Overpriced DLCs that offer very little for your buck. SC4 has plenty of similar mods and plugins that are completely free to begin with.

Pros or Cons depending on your style of play:

- Increased options for trade of goods and services between towns. Some of them I find them quite unrealistic though. At least it mitigates (minimally) the small town sizes.
- Water and power built automatically under roads. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's incredible how the greed for money can ruin user experience. And those EA guys trying to convince us that DRM implemented in the game is totally alright. Seriously EA i stop buying your games you don't deserve it. YOu deserve to die as a company that kills nice IPs and gamedev companies. That DRM that doesn't allow you to play SP is just a last drop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish this game was released as a standalone game, I was looking forward to playing both Battlefield 3 and Sim City 5.

The requirements are unreasonable for me, being always online, the servers having enough capacity for me to play when and where I want.

What happens when there is lag?
When the number of cities you can have gets limited artificially?
When they shut down the servers?

Maybe they should focus on making good games, instead of trying to figure out what is the best way to make money from day one with DLC.

I'm never installing origin or a game that uses it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All i have to say is THERE IS NO SAVE SYSTEM Wtf  No even in Single player mode!
ITS AN MMO with Private island  and a cheat mode...

60 euros for that  just LOL 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Always online DRM, smaller, non-connected cities due to engine limitations, DAY 0 DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT, poor customer service and delivery of product (waited almost an hour to connect to my single player game), and a swath of simplifications in the gameplay that ruins it for a SC veteran like myself.

Don't bother to get this game. Save some money and buy Sim City 4, or Sim City 2000. You can play them OFFLINE as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay elements are what is expected of a SimCity game, however innovation outside bus stops and the moods of the citizens (along with other The Sims features) do not exist. It's sad to realize that many people are okay with having extremely small plots of land (2x2 km), far smaller than any previous SimCity game, the reason why it's tolerated? Fanboyism? The ridiculous notion that the game should be played by connecting 5 plots to each other on one area (going to a different plot will pause all the others, that doesn't seem very "connected"). I don't care for excuses like "Oh, but it will cause graphical bugs", am I supposed to give them sympathy for incompetence?

Outside the game. I hope everyone enjoys a game which has always been a single player game, now turned in to an always-online internet required with multi player features... such as having friends in the same region work on their own cities, wow thanks for adding that, it wasn't excuse to justify recent EA policies against piracy which only hurts actual customers and delays a cracked version by a few days? Maybe less? Well, I bought this for only $40 on a sale, refunding it already and uninstalled Origin. You've ruined the SimCity series and you've corrupted Maxis, just like every other previous game developing company. Go bankrupt already, EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

-Airport City (the city is only one International Airport, occupying the entire mao 2x2km)
-Automatic road connections

-Dead space between all the buildings
-Size of the maps is 2km by 2km (small maps)

Please ignore the EA shills and fan-girls who are trying to boost the score.  There are some great ideas here, especially with the way the simulation works and includes surrounding regions in multiplayer.  I just can't experience them for myself because EA didn't bother to provide enough server power to support the launch.  Instead, I paid $60 for a mini-game where I sit in a queue for a half-hour at a time, only to restart that line when the server still isn't available.  I could care less about it being DRM.  I want to play the game I paid for, and I can't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is not Sim City.  With the tiny land size it should have been called 'Sim-Town'.  You are set in a region, where you either have to personally manage several 'towns' and specialize them towards a regional goal. If you choose to play with other people, you better hope they are on board with the common goal or they can basically contribute nothing.  On top of the obvious goal of monetizing the game with micro transactions over it's lifetime, the 'always on' internet requirement... this feels more like an iPad game than a PC game.  Shame on the review sites for lowering there expectations of PC games to that of mobile gaming standards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful game. This is not SimCity. This is SimVillage. You cannot build a city: for starters, a 2 by 2 kilometre map is far from a city. I get real cities are many hundreds of square kilometres, and this would be impossible to simulate, but 8 by 8 km would provide satisfactory room. Honestly, it takes just a few hours to fill up a city. Secondly, the cities are separated by retarded open land, and cities are "in a bubble", contradictory to Lucy Bradshaw and others. If city tiles were contiguous, small maps wouldn't be such a problem. but then roads and rail would still be fixed in place  another thing that really annoys me. The graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is great, but this doesn't mean much when I play for a few an hour and have fully developed my city. Then, there's Origin. I couldn't play SimCity because of EA's pathetic platform for almost ten hours, unable to download it. Once I did download it, I took me half and hour to eventually connect to a server. Simcity's online-only aspect has bit EA on the backside, proving that, for now, it is not a reliable way to deliver a game. I've played SimCity 3000 and 4, and it looks like I will continue to do so after this train-wreck.

Please, avoid this game, you will be disappointed (unless you're just a casual "gamer") 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unable to play due to server at capacity. In a single-player game. This is ridiculous. Simplified gameplay that does not provide as deep an experience as any of the previous SimCity games. While I'm sure that the server errors will be ironed out over time, the simplified gameplay will not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Update 3/14: Login issues seem to be fixed, but there are still major problems with this game. We all know about the forced online and small map size, but I haven't seen too many people mention the bugs. Remember how the beta was capped at 1 hour? There are TONS of issues, and most of them only become apparent after a few hours of play. I suspect the beta was less about finding and squashing bugs, and more about publicity. I've had every single sim become homeless for no apparent reason, hundreds of thousands of simoleans disappear from my treasury, buses and trade centers refuse to work despite there being no traffic, and power to cities going out upon logging, taking several in-game days before it decides to turn on again.  The list goes on. Now, the SimCity franchise is no stranger to bugs, but these are literally game-ending because there is no save ability. There are questionable gameplay mechanics too, such as the inter-connectivity of cities, where a single 'bad' player can ruin a game, or the crippling simplicity of the transit, job and housing system. The latter has only become apparent in the last few days, and it indicates everything Maxis/EA told us about sophisticated AI and massive amounts of route calculations was a lie.  Google it and see for yourself.  SimCity is not a 'sim' in any sense of the word, and I can't recommend it to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Small city sizes makes the game not true to the simcity series. In addition, the always on connection required with servers that cannot handle the loads just further drops the ball. Maxis had a great idea, great game plan, great foundation, but failed to deliver with the execution of the final simcity game. I call it the final, because they will lose a lot of long time fans of the series with this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Good: Simcity has very good graphics. The data overlays are beautiful. Construction looks realistic. Nonrenewable resources add a new and interesting flavor to the game. Multiplayer regions with multiple cities online add a new and very fun flavor. There are new disasters which look and play realistically, have unexpected effects on your city. You can now build curving roads and road/road overpasses. Roads now govern your buildings density. There is a good selection of different buildings. The Bad: -Serverside
Always-Online DRM means that you have to have a stable internet connection; the slightest hiccup in your internet will result in the game crashing and you losing hours of game play. The servers are horrible; most of them are either "busy" or "full", meaning that you can't play at all. They also crash often. Server capacity is abysmal. There is no "offline" option for single player games. All saves must be synced with EA's cloud servers; you cannot have any local saves on your hard drive. -Clientside
Buildings often look half finished and devoid of color or decoration; it is clear that this was an unfinished product that was rushed out. City sizes are limited to approx. 2km x 2km; slightly smaller then the smallest map size on Simcity 4. Buildings cannot be placed anywhere where they are not adjacent to a road; you can no longer fill in the interior of city blocks with parks/etc. Some graphics appear half finished, i.e. grass showing through a road, dirt overlapping on a road, or jagged/flickering graphics. The game is slow to respond to neighbor deals, such as sending power or sewage to a neighbor. Parks look like they're made with astroturf. Waves/beaches look unrealistic. Zones are aligned on a road and cannot be expanded to show the entire zone; this makes planning for city blocks very difficult. There is no subway, elevated rail, monorail, or highways available to be built. Agriculture/farms have been completely removed from the game. It was not designed to be compatible with player-designed mods. Overall:
This game had the potential to be something great, to be a truly awesome game. But with the forced DRM limitations EA has imposed on us, as well as the horrifying state of their servers, this game has become yet another destined for the bookshelf. Maxis outdid itself with bringing new ideas, concepts, and operations into the game, but with the client-side limitations such as city sizes and lack of transportation options, not to mention the server-side DRM, the game is effectively crippled. Bluntly, I can not recommend this game to anyone. One can only hope that EA will listed to the community and fix what is wrong.

This game is fundamentally broken on almost all levels.  AI is oversimplified and a hindrance to game advancement.  Online only functionality is not worth the restrictions.  Players end up with a tiny generic city that becomes more and more frustrating to grow.  This game is a massive disappointment, even beyond the restrictive DRM and launch issues.  This will be the last EA game I will purchase, no matter what the name of the studio they assimilate.  Because, that studio is only a name.  None of the original Maxis seems to exist in this product.  I hope this serves as a lesson to the game industry and its consumers.

A wonderful game that is ruined by it's implementation. SimCity is a beautiful and unique game to play. You'll find yourself indulged for hours. However, the infrastructure that backs this game is susceptible to high-volumes.
Digitally the game is setup to play online always. The problem is that, server availability, stability and performance now affect every aspect of the game. So far my experience has gone from good to extremely unhappy. This is a very poor implementation of game, and I feel this release is ruined and not worth playing at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Have revised my score upwards slightly, as EA has now actually allowed me to play the game rather than the loading screen for the first time. It was a lot of fun. A lot. This would be a fantastic single-player game. But then I lost connection, and couldn't log back on. That was not fun. Then EA allowed me to play again several hours later, and I found I had lost hours of progress. That was even less fun. Why is there no "Save" option? Never before have I played a game with that gave me such enjoyment before letting me down so badly. If it was an MMO it wouldn't feel so bad. But it's a single player game, and it doesn't NEED to be server-dependent. It really feels like EA is playing some cruel game here with one of my favorite game series of all times. They set it up this way deliberately, knowing that this would happen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The DRM in an effort to make money by stopping piracy killed the game and lost them millions.  I will never buy a game with DRM again.   The gameplay seems meh but I only could play for a small amount of time since the DRM stops me from playing all together.  Don't buy this until they remove the DRM!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been waiting all day to play this game, however so far ive spent more time waiting to get into the game, and finally when i got into the game, every public region was locked. I managed to build a very small city until the game crashed forcing me to go through all this again. Do not waste your money on this. This always online thing is a terrible idea and does not make sense for a game that could easily be offline. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ea, f*** everything, you know the REAL reason about cities are small? Its simple... They will CHARGE YOU in microtransactions for terrain expand, if you want a bigger terrain, you will have to buy it, per section. Why this game doesn't support mods? Because they will launch a bunch of DLCs for you tune up your experience. Also i cant forget the god damn DMR, and for the fun sake, this is a pain in our asses! And about the stupid queue to connect in server and finally start play the game? I bought this and COULD NOT PLAY due the server difficulties.

JUST ANOTHER GAME EA SCREWED 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoy playing, but the drm, server problems, and city size persuade me to just play SC4. I didnt think that it would be this bad but its so very annoying that I cant make sprawling large cities. Digital Rights Management is a joke, and servers, while fixable, are so very flawed. The actual gameplay is very enioyable but I just cant say this is something worth buying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After building a gaming PC for this game and a couple of other recent releases I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. I can't even play the tutorial level at the moment as I keep getting a 'servers are full' message. Not quite the gaming experience I hoped for when paying nearly £50 for a digital release! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I specifically created this account to express my distaste for this game. Let alone the incredibly horrible and incompetent launch, the always online DRM and the small maps, the game itself is broken and should never have been released in its current state. Let me emphasize that if you do buy the game; know that you’ll feel like you’re participating in a beta test and not a finished product. First, the traffic system does not work and it creates traffic hell. And hey you can’t alleviate it with a subway system, but what you can do is create a snake like road system with no interactions so the AI does not screw itself over. Also, the sewage system is broken (it seems like it follows the same pathing as traffic, that is ALWAYS taking the shortest route even though there are other routes available), the power grid system is broken and the water system is broken too with similar issues as traffic. Even though you have plenty of capacity for these things, the engine does allow distribution between routes A, B and C, but only chooses one route, leading to congestion and full stop. And this did not show up in internal testing? Furthermore, if there is a disaster such as a fire, all your fire trucks are sent at the same time, often driving in weird circles or not arriving at the fire at all. Moving on, the regional trading system is also broken. If you send money to another city, know that the money arrives (if it arrives) several hours or maybe a day or two later. I have not tried sending any other resources in fear of losing them permanently. And then there’s the main problem, the RCI zoning issue. You can build a city completely made up of residential. No need for commercial zones and industrial because parks take care of the jobs! The developers have purposely created a game where residential zoning is independent of commercial zones; they only need industrial for jobs, and in the extreme case you only need parks. The fundamental core of the whole series is in shambles. And good luck with getting a refund if you bought this over origin, it’s impossible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game. Long loading, expensive dlc, pseudo multiplayer, server problems, functional buildings not working. This game does most of what it is trying to achieve wrong.There are in fact so many problems with this game that you can not even count them and Maxis is not able to fix it so what do they do? They release DLC for around 10€ that adds blimps for transportation which is one of the broken features of the game. Well at least the game looks good when you are in the statistic screens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game made me sad  I have played and loved this franchise for as long as I can remember (well, except Societies which I pretend didn't happen). Unfortunately, SimCity gets far too much wrong. I can overlook the always online thing; though at the same time, for all the hype and drama caused by it, I don't feel it adds very much to the experience.

The main reasons I don't like this game are the maps are far too small, traffic is an abomination  your city is eventually brought to its knees no matter how small it is and too much generally goes wrong. Fundamentally, there are too many limitations in the game. SimCity's marketing line is "Your City, Your Way". I find it is anything but...it is "My City, Maxis' Way". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Patch 2.0 has come out, a patch so huge that they gave it a .0 release number.  It resolves many issues with the game but unfortunately BREAKS many others.  Unbelievably, they have resolved traffic issues from fire trucks and police cars piling up, but have broken taxis and school busses  which now pile up.  They broke pollution and now tiny cities with zero industry will see MASSIVE pollution rolling across their glass box reducing land value and making your 500 person city unhappy  this even on regions with zero other cities.  Maxis cannot seem to get it right.  After their complete failure with Spore failing to deliver the game that they had presented at all the expos, I really expected them to nail this one, but alas this is a cataclysmic failure that will likely spell the demise of Will Wright's brainchild. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun game when it works, but servers are congested and rarely function.  Basically unplayable.  EA's stated they're going to remove functions from the game to decrease load, but that's also reducing the fun factor.  Do not buy.  Complete waste of money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh dear, what a massive disappointment! I avoided this when it was released due to the widespread bugs - but I heard they'd been fixed and it was available cheap so I gave it a shot.

To be perfectly blunt, this game does not hold a candle - even today - to Sim City 4. It's laughable in comparison. Everything has a gloss on it which gives a distinctly cartoon-like feel, completely ruining immersion in the simulation. It doesn't look "bad" as such, but it isn't what I'm looking for in a city simulator; why micromanage something that doesn't take itself seriously? Don't get me wrong, adding a bit of fun and quirkiness has always been a feature of the Sim games, but that can be done by the context of the game (such as the llama references and such) rather than with the graphical look.

The maps are so small that it should be called Sim Village. They even managed to ruin the UI, which was one of the only weaknesses in Sim City 4 - it's now outright annoying.

So even at a low price, I can't recommend this title. Sim City 4 is available on GOG and is comfortably the superior game in pretty much every respect.

In summary, Sim City and Sims 4 shows how far EA have fell with this franchise. Both are cash cows for the gullible, and I won't be caught out again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played all SimCity versions from the first one and SimCity 5 is nothing else than a piece of garbage. I don't care about the DRM; that is something that don't bothered me.  But, the game himself is a  big deception in many ways.  First, the size of the map is ridiculous.  Imagine... you have to think two times before adding a single football field because it take too space on the map!!  Other disaster is the very strict link between road and building, park, etc.  Nothing can be build freely in the map because everything have to connect to a road... and you cannot turn objects to fit in a particular orientation.  This result in most space lost (so precious space) is you want curve roads in your city.

There is no beach stuff,  no marina-harbor or ship industry, no tree, very limited choice of building.
I already write enough about this game. Please, do not give your money to EA; keep it for another more serious developper. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I went to the trouble of creating an account just so I could warn folks not to buy this game. A persistent online, single-player game where the servers do not work is a setup for failure.

Now, granted, when you do get in (for me about 15/100 times), the game is very good. Visually a delight. But from server issues at launch to ongoing issues on the first and second days post-launch, I just cannot recommend this game. And this comes from someone who has played every SimCity since the first in 1989 when I was still in high school.

I play games to relax and unwind. And this game has been an utter frustration instead. I'm going to return this game for a refund and hopefully re-purchase in a month or two when either the servers get better or EA realizes the DRM and persistent online scheme appropriate for a MMORPG is not appropriate for a single-player city simulator. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably nothing more to add than anyone else did. Could be a great game, but the ineptitude of EA and Maxis could be a brand killer. I don't mind the smaller city sizes as much, but to require that the player have to be connected to servers and then not to have them ready to go is just ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's sad to see that the potential and future success of this game was ruined by the always online DRM, the constant server crashes, the inability to actually play Single Player, which I was hoping to have been able to do. The ways these ideas were implemented was a slap to the face for the gaming community and me. If anything, Sim City does not deserve the 83 Metascore it currently holds until they can listen to their consumers and correct the online DRM they have on play. If they honestly think that having these strict DRMs actually prevent piracy...they are wrong. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was a completely terrible decision for EA to add such restrictive DRM to a single player game. I may have been more forgiving if the game was actually playable for me. But even still the online features are ridiculous, especially online only saves and the inability to play this game at launch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

FIX YOUR SERVER ISSUES EA  You should have been prepared  you had thousands of pre-orders and two beta tests to indicate the level of demand and plan for it accordingly.  Loyal fans of the SimCity brand have waited 10 years to play this game and you have proven yourselves to be completely and utterly ill-prepared and downright incompetent in dealing with the demand.  I cannot give more than 2/10 as I have only managed to get 2 hours of gameplay since launch day  pathetic!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My number one complaint is that you have to be online to play this game, even if you're playing by yourself. Number two complaint is the city size. They're downright tiny. I would like to be able to build much bigger cities. Lastly, it's a very frustrating process to even try to play, mainly because servers are always busy. It's taken me up to 30 minutes to be able to connect. I know this is a launch issue which will get solved eventually, but people who payed $60 to be the first to play this highly-anticipated game probably are feeling cheated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME." That's what I told everyone who would listen a couple of weeks ago. I have now cooled down, and will now say this: This game is worth 10£. Not more. One user here said it was a 80£ Facebook game, which is pretty much the most accurate description of the latest Sim City I have seen.

I am not an EA hater (please disregard my nickname). I don't even mind Origin, or the insanely annoying always-on DRM system. Hell, I can even accept overpriced digital downloads if they're for a decent game such as Mass Effect or Star Wars: The Old Republic. I'm a grown man, I can afford a fiver here and a fiver there. The number one problem with this game is that is completely, utterly dull. Replayability: Zero. I had been looking forward to this game since it was announced, but started to worry when I was bored in the beta even before the mind numbingly stupid one-hour time limit was up.

When the game was released, my worst fears came true. Nevermind the fact that I couldn't play for two days because EA didn't want to spend money on server capacity. Maxis, hopefully bullied around by the suits in EA, had utterly ruined one of my favorite franchise. The list of reasons why this game completely fails to live up to its predecessor is long. Very long. Here are a few game-breakers.

- City size. You -will- use all the available land within an hour or three. After that, it's all about understanding how the game's traffic system works. Or doesn't, depending on how you see it.

- Traffic. As mentioned, it is horrible. The agent system in Sandbox (Sim City's engine) simply does not work for traffic. Emergency vehicles get stuck in traffic, city services (garbage trucks, school buses etc.). Google "Sim City traffic" and you will see just how realistic looking cities that "work" in this game are.

- AI is non existent. The PR people at EA bragged much about how each sim would have his or her own job, personality, home etc. That was a lie. Every morning, every sim goes out looking for a job, stopping at the first available job for his or her education level. It is impossible to feel attached to your citizens, because the only thing their zombielike behaviour does is messing up traffic even more.

- Multiplayer is worthless, there is very little (if any) cooperation and interaction between cities in a region.

- No terraforming. Your territory acts like a plot from one of the Sims games. Just more static.

- It is impossible to build a realistic city. All the reasons above contribute to that fact, and if you ever hoped you could simulate your home town like you did in Sim City 4 or one of the earlier games, forget it. This game won't do it.

- City specialization is far from deep enough, and stops being interesting after a few hours.

I'm going to be generous and give this game a score of 2. I might have given it 3 points if it didn't break such an amazing franchise. The dumbed down graphics look nice, in a model landscape sort of way, which was supposedly what the devs were going for, and the game will keep you entertained for a few hours. Oh, and there's a color blind mode.

If you see this game on a 10£ sale  I have no doubt that we will see very soon) go for it, but don't believe for a second that the critic reviews aren't biased.  This is a terrible, terrible game.

Buy any of the Tropico games, Cities XL, Cities in Motion or any of the other city sims out there. They are much better. Sim City 4 is still the king. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been a Sim Cities fan ever since I picked up Sim City 3000 when I was a kid. I bought this game a week after it was officially released and so far I've been disappointed. The first serious problem you come across once you launch the game is trying to find a map that has open slots. Not only is there no way to filter the maps with ones that have spots open, but they're listed from the oldest to newest! I had to click through through pages and pages of servers and I spent almost 20 minutes trying to find a map with open slots!

Now, once you get to building your city things start to get interesting. The graphics are very good, but the tutorial is very limited on teaching you the major dynamics of the game such as zone densities, freight, etc. It plays out just like every other Sim City game, but it's remarkably much easier than Sim City 3000 & 4000 to stay in a positive budget. Building your city is very fun and challenging if you have to build around terrain or natural resources, but you very quickly come to realize just how small the maps are.

The maps are about half the size of what I remember from any Sim City game and it literally doesn't take that much time before you're trying to squeeze out every inch of space in your city. Eventually you do hit the point where you have no more space. Also, the game's density system is overly complex and you will eventually hit a bottleneck where your city can't get any bigger.

Literally I would say 5-6 hours into my city I would run out of space, couldn't increase my population any further, and I was making so much money that my city had millions in the bank. Also, the game's AI is very bad with it comes to trash collection, buses, and just about everything else.

TLDR; too easy, gets boring fast, crappy map browser, great graphics, crappy AI, and SMALL MAPS!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1.EA..that greeeedddyyyy bastards..that's all i will say about that
2.Graphic : Graphic is beautiful..for sim city and CoT , from 1-10..pure 9
3.Servers : i mean..realy ??? realy ??? 3-5 or more hrs of work and then "unable to load city..try later" or similar..if..but that's BIG IF you load your city after crash you are damnnnnn lucky
- from 5 cities,at least 2 times on each has crashed and i was able to load..gues how many ?? 1.. ONE.. (later when crash this one goes to hell to..what a surprise.. -.-)
4.Borders : you (if you lucky (online)) will play about 3-5 hrs if you screw with the game..if not,you wil play 2 hrs at most,for ofline ..same..per one city
5.Graphic design of menu : easy to navigate and clearly
6.Bugs : I will not even start with this..damnnnn
7.Would i recomend this game : Helllll NOOOOOOOOO..play 3 or 4---->3 are my favorite,4 is nice for verryyy big city..
8.If you have nerves for to damn bugy game and you want to play realy let say smal part of city (town)..buy..otherwise..don't even bother with this piece of crap
One more thing : EA - thank you for ruin my favorite game and take my money for **** -.- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved sim city 4 a lot, for some reason when I play this im not sure if its because im more stupid now or something but I don't understand the game cant grasp around it very well. the building on the zones especially has to be connected to the road to build the zone instead of previous versions you could just make zones then worry about roads later and how zones take a certain size im not sure just rubs me the wrong way.

even after the tutorial this games learning curve seems really streamlined but yet oddly steep at the same time im trying to figure out if the games just to different so I don't understand it or don't like it or what. I gave this game 3 chances spaced out a couple between each and well still makes me want to hurl to be honest.

I got this game after all the online crap got sorted out so have nothing to say about that overly. the city size is small as all other people have said you need to make other cities to help your city cause you cant build a mega metropilis on this small lot (sims reference :p ) where on sim city 4 you could make wonderful huge cities even on smaller areas with everything packed into it it had a hard learning curve to get a good economy and money in the positive but it made so much more sense.

conclusion this games not good for majority of sim city players will not like this at all, I can see more sim players liking this over sim city players (not insulting sim players by the way) it looks pretty and that's about it this game feels like a demo of sim city 4 just prettier is all. instead of building a huge city with every building in it sometimes almost 1 million people they give you this dumb downed little plot of land to make a small town (it feels like it anyways) I regret buying this game I tried to like it but even how they changed the interface of building and nerfed city size I try to like it but I cant.

final advice if your still considering this game after all these reviews people have done make sure you watch tons of review videos, gameplay videos etc learn everything you can about it at first glanced looked pretty good seemed somewhat similar but after I installed it started it up waited 3 hours for updates ontop of that started the game itself made my little plot of land and puked in my mouth it seems.

First review for a game on here (sadly this one) and all those reasons up there is why its a 2/10 for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although I'm sure many people have already made their mind up about this game, I thought I'd send my review none the less. Sim City....is dead, or at least the franchise that many of us are used to is anyway. Gone are the expansive maps and the hours of offline play we used to have. Gone is the steep learning curve and satisfying feeling from  The always online requirement, although called a "development decision by Maxis" certainly stinks of anti-piracy DRM. Maxis ensure there is no way to disable this but the problem being of course that sources within Maxis have denied that this is a requirement but a simple trigger within the code. I have seen people play this game with no water, no electricity, no jobs and high pollution and yet their plot of land has developed into a huge city of skyscrapers, this to me suggests it's less of a simulation than you may think which takes away from the reason people play the game. Sim City isn't without it's pro's, graphically it's aesthetically pleasing with the hustle and bustle of a city being animated fairly well, albeit traffic forming where it shouldn't. The city overlays are also a nice addition, showing the water, electricity and sewage in real time  you can also look at the bars of happiness and likeliness to expand for each house. Aside from these pro's, the game seem's extremely poor, closer to Farmville than Sim City 4. If you're new to gaming, don't want a challenge and have an extremely stable internet connection then perhaps Sim City is for you, however if any of the above don't fit your criteria I'd suggest staying way clear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It ridiculous that EA dont want to hear us as their customer. The original habits of Simcity are offline, easy to safe the games, user can act as god who able to create their own land contour and the city should large or huge. But this Simcity 2013 is far from those features.
1. I always have to connect to internet (and the server sometimes are full)
2. The server cannot synch our files to other alternative servers they offer (It so shame)
3. The synch between the games and server only when we out from the games (imagine if it crash after we play for 4 hours, which is always happened)
4. The city is so small, dont event thinking to have Hi way surround the city... the area more like a village rather than a city.
5. Crash while gameplay, and after that... even though have a feature Roll Back but still the city cannot be open. I have report this to EA and no solution until now.
6. The AI of traffic, dump truck route and bus are even worse

Plus point of this games is only graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Many bugs, crashed savegames 'cause of server issues, a non-balanced gameplay. Less functions, options building space and buildings than you have sim city 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics nice. Rest, bad. This is a facebook-style game. EA made it un-piratable (always DRM). The question to EA is:  Does it justifies the low scores and bad reviews, hatred from people who bought the game? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Words can not describe my utter disappointment at this game. Being the still proud owner of Sim City 4 that I am, I really looked forward to Sim City with the utmost enthusiasm. Was I ever disappointed.
I will start with the thing that most have complained about. The Anti-Piracy measures that EA Games decided to attach to this game (Digital Rights Management). I understand that you need to put a stop to piracy but at the cost of your paying customer base? This was a bad move on behalf of EA and could have been handled so much better.
Next is the size of the city which you can build. 2Km x 2Km. Most small towns I know of are bigger than this. It makes you feel extremely limited while also feeling that you could be doing so much more. I got the feeling that EA will be releasing paid for content which will increase the map size though.
I gave this a 2 based on the quality of graphics, 0 was my first option. I found the graphics to be fairly pleasant to look at when you eventually prove that you didn't steal the game and are able to log in. The engine needs some work as it can be a little choppy but overall the visuals are good.
To sum this up: I hope that EA have learned that there is a limit to what you can use as an anti-piracy measure before it becomes too much for the legitimate customer base to put up with.  Presuming that people who downloaded the pirated version of previous games would have paid for a genuine copy is incorrect. Most of them probably wouldn't have so you can't call it a "loss" and then to implement measures which kill your developers game and reputation is just selfish and naive, especially of a large company like EA. Digital Rights Management (DRM) as an anti-piracy measure doesn't work. To top all this, a pirated version was released anyway. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SimCity 5 is the degraded Version of SimCity 4  Never Expected this from Maxis. NO facility for bridges /flyover. Monorail and elevated rail are gone. Area provided for Building the city is too small. No teraforming   This game really Sucks..  l repent purchasing-this game. Maxis  give me back my money!:  CITIES XL is still the best city building game ever built. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't bother! The map sizes will completely disappoint you. Just when things start to get somewhere you need to build another city to support your main one. Complete BS. The always online ruined this game. EA is just too greedy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is such a disgrace to what used to be a stellar series, not due to the core game, but due to the cynical and life draining DRM and internet only play which restrict so much of what SimCity is about. Unfortunately even when actually managing to play, the game commits suicide by having tiny city squares and ridiclous restrictions on buildings, whose only raison d'etre is to persuade you to play with others, a feature that the game already betrays itself!

Unfortunately I believe that this game is too flawed at the fundamental level to ever be a worthy successor to the brilliant SimCity 4. A shame, because the franchise at it's heart is legendary amongst the PC community and can be so much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ignoring the servers, which are not a problem anymore, the game is playable. Of course, a big thing lowering the score is the map size and the always-online DRM. No local saving, the game will probably be down in some years when the servers get shut down and there is no single player mode. It is true that EA is just fishing for money from the Simcity 4 players who trusted EA that they would make an awesome new version. I myself foolishly pre-ordered the game too, how could I have known that Simcity Digital was  after the Simcity 4 was one of my favourite games when it was released? Unlike those who gave a zero, I am still able to give a two, as the servers are working fairly well now. Though I must admit that on the release the servers simply did not work for even nearly everyone 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, buy SimCity 4 instead.

The newest SimCIty should be called SimGraphicsCity instead. The only thing better about this version is that the shadows and lighting effects are cooler. Gone is the ability to create large sprawling cities with downtowns and residential neighborhoods. What really made the previous games fantastic was the amount you needed to micro manage. For god's sake, you had to lay water pipes and electrical lines.

Did you like subways? yeah forget about that, it's gone.

Remember how there were other cities you could interact with but it didn't matter? Well this is almost all about interacting with neighboring cities.

Honestly, it feels like Farmville 2.0 at times. Here let  me gift my neighbor a garbage truck.

The only thing I can say that really stops this from being a complete turd is that the Info-porn graphic overlays are amazing.

Oh yeah, and forget about playing this game on your laptop on the commuter train, or any place where you don't have internet access. You need to be constantly logged in for it to work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really looked forward to this game, but it just does not deliver to what it once was. If you want that old-school SimCity feel? Look elsewhere, you are gone so regret buying this game.

Ill gibe em 2/10 for the effort  yeah effort of ruining a perfect franchise... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the perfect example of what happens when you rush a game out for sales alone. The city sizes are tiny and things don't work how they're supposed to. The sims are terribly programmed causing one of my roads to be stuck in gridlock and the other almost completely empty. Once I reached a high enough population my sewage system stopped functioning and my city was ruined. When a game requires mods just  to work you know it's a bad game. Don't buy this. It's bad even with mods. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is awesome! When I'm able to play it... Unfortunately, the always-online DRM that comes with this game makes it very difficult to do so. Yes, it is only the first few days of launch, but it sure would be nice if I didn't have to worry about server loads, disconnects, rollbacks, downtime, maintenance, losing hours on my cities, ect. I understand it's no longer a single player game, but I'd much rather have the option to play online with friends rather than be forced to play by their server scheduled when all I want to do is play in my own region.

I defended Diablo 3s always-online model, mostly because I was blinded by fan-girl-ism and I thought a game shouldn't be rated based on a games servers. Not anymore. This game deserves the metascore that the critics give it, but I just can't feel the same as long as this DRM is in place. It's such a terrible model to prevent piracy and companies like EA and Blizzard need to learn this. Fast. It only hurts the consumers that paid actual money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There isn't anything more offensive than cloud computing errors causing game to me nonexistent. Moreover, spending nearly $60-$80 on a title so HIGHLY exclaimed as the GOY, and yet comes off as a huge failure. When the game is playing, it's fun, social, and is a refreshing update to the simcity franchise. What ruins the game for me is as follows:  No single player, No save option  outside of forced incontinent cloud storage), server errors (you think they would have gotten this ready for the launch), inaccurate protesting (crime levels down to zero, yet protests for high crime  change power source for town when paused and after relaunching game town protests lost of power), force closing (it's the only game in the last 3 years I've played with massive force closures on a regular basis)  EA support (no upgrades after launch day errors, and seemingly weak support), ORIGIN ran. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Always-online DRM, which depends on unreliable EA servers; overly simplified gameplay (to the point where underground was removed completely); city size is small; zoning is faulty and reduced (no farms and such) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA MURDERED THE NEW SIMCITY!
In case you have not yet noticed, SimCity has what is called constantly online DRM. This means if the game is running, you MUST be online and logged into Origin, EA's sales platform, and response to Steam. Now this sounds excellent, in theory. Everyone gets updates automatically, you can play with anyone all over the world, etc. However, the viability of this method ends at THEORY. In reality, this is the smoking gun for this game. I have only had the opportunity to play this game once, for 1 hour and 30 minutes, before I was kicked from the server due to high volume. This is completely unreasonable, and I feel EA was completely unprepared to handle so many users on the server. That is major, obvious oversight on their part, and it ruined the game.
Further, totally offline mode is completely eliminated. When I play a game such as SimCity, I expect to be able to play the classic mode where I can quietly play, ALONE. This is no longer an option, as all the cities in a region must co-mingle and supply each other with services, or the city itself is penalized! As an experiment,  I attempted to play on a server with other players and remain independent, and rejected the assistance offered to me by other players. After a while, my economy collapsed because all my workers were automatically leaving my city to work at a neighbor's city. They are programmed to do this for absolutely no reason, other than penalizing players who wish to remain independent from others.

In short, the Online Requirement murdered this game, and I regret wasting my hard earned money on it. I encourage all prospective customers to NOT purchase this game, as it will only lead to your disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Haha, oh wow, my god, it hurts me so much to see this actually happening.
Well, that was the last straw. I already made the mistake of buying HP2010 and BF3, I won't repeat it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is broken is almost every important aspect. Sure, I can imagine IF one day everything works, it could be a 8/10 candidate. But as it is, on two fronts the game is entirely broken. In the Agent System, and in the server/online feature.

There have been plenty of reports how and why the agent system and the other ingame systems don't work. There is little I could add to what has been said a 1000 times by now. Simply too many subsystems of the game do not work at all.

But I could live with traffic issues, simlulation disparities, trash gathering... all of it, if the game would actually, physically work. Just it doesn't. I invested 2 days in a region, and suddenly the game went to the main screen, out of the blue, "Server crashed" and the entire savegame of the region was broken and I could never load it again. Then I started a new region, two specialized cities, I put DAYS of long, hard work into the cities and was proud to finally got them them running. Them BAM, the game forced me to the main menu, the city was RESET, and the hard work of DAYS was lost to me.

I contacted EA support, but they could do nothing to reset my savegames, which were lost entirely due to their fault. So they have no backups, and they have no system to save the savegames on MY OWN computer for safety backup. I can really live with a lot of issues, but when days of work into a game are ruined, it is beyond any excuse. And for weeks this is so, and EA simply refuses to communicate with it's customers.

I give 2 honorary points for the idea behind the game, but the game is at the moment ENTIRELY broken, unplayable and as it looks, the issues run so deep it will take months to enable a halfway working status. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Has a significant amount of potential.  Visually the game is awesome.  They did incorporate some great ideas such as interacting with other cities for trade, sharing resources, commuters, etc.  However, the specialization provides limited options.  Major Problem #1: Cities are too small!!  I know their excuse for it but really?  It's ridiculous and almost ruins the game on its own.  Major Problem #2: It's just too easy, there isn't a whole lot to it and it can be mastered quickly Major Problem #3 There are no ordinances, policies etc to run the city--it has simply been turned into a city building game with sometimes silly animated visuals Major Problem #4: Big changes have minimal impact-- for the city to really go downhill you really, really have to do it almost on purpose, you can get away with a lot, this isn't realistic.

Overall I am VERY disappointed with SimCity (5).  Not because it wasn't made well (it was, it's def. quality) but because they put in all of this thought and missed the main reasons why people love the SimCity franchise--you can run all facets of a city including policies, more detailed finances (what about budgeting by department??) and other strategically driven options and inputs.  I still recommend the game but only for those interested in a pretty straight forward city building game- the management people should leave it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Good:  Beautiful game, good soundtrack, they added a lot of cool new features since Sim City 4 and went away from the train wreck that was 'Societies'.

The Bad: Tiny, little maps.  I want to build a massive, pollution-belching metropolis like in SC4, but you can't. You are limited to the same sized Cities as in 'Societies'. With all the great features implemented in this title there is no room to use them.  The game also requires that be online to play, unfortunately EA didn't plan for the launch.  I've spent more time trying to play than actually playing.  In trying to load one of my 4 Cities it reports that I cannot due to the servers being down.  Maxis is a good developer, at least they were until they got gobbled-up by EA.   I will certainly think twice before buying any additional EA titles in the future.  It's clear that they care less about your gaming experience then they do about your dollar. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am so disappointed that i want to cry. HUGE fan of sim city 4 (certainly more than 1 000 hours in 10 years)  This game isn't a sim city anymore, it is a f***ing Facebook social sim village-city. Ridiculously easy, stupidly small and uselessly social. IT is a shame Maxis and EA, shame on you  And shame on sold video games websites that gave this game a good rate, which is certainly not deserved. I hope Desperately that some TRUE sim-city fan will develop a kickstarted project. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow! I'm so disappointed with how the game going so far. I lost 2 newly start-up cities already because of disconnection. I've high expectations for this game since it cost $60. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aside from the server and always online issues. There are some major bugs in the game that need to get fixed as well. With more gamebreaking bugs being found every day it seems. Traffic is the number one issue, only a few people have managed to truly trick the simulator and keep a good traffic flow going. A normal city layout and traffic pattern will not work and you need to fool the sims into going the way you want them too. Not normal, but tricks are needed. Essential services are broken, Fire trucks will all respond to the same fire, leaving others burning. They will all then go to the next fire and so on. Pathfinding on these is also horrendous, watching wrong turns and u-turns abound. Busses will do the same thing, they will all take the same paths and stop at the same stops over and over again. Anything far away in a densely packed city may never see a bus, or all of them at the same time. Very odd. Anything over 100k city will only see around 10% actually doing anything. While your city is demanding more workers and more shoppers. There are many more, Aside from the server issues, this promised to be a good game. Digging into it, it is hopelessly broken. Simulation fails on just about every level one could imagine. Maybe they did it to make it harder to desing a functioning city, or that region play was to fill in the gaps, if only region play actually worked. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Size city limits are absurd. Having to be online all the time to play even alone is ridiculous. Lack of terraforming and custom regions is disappointing. The game play has been dumbed down  to the point where there is no challenge. There are no difficulty levels, every game is the same. If you don't already have friends on Origin then it's impossible to find a game to play in. There is no way to search for open games or reorder the game list to show available cities. Compared to Sim City 4 this game is garbage, I wish I hadn't even bought it. The only good thing about the game is that the graphics are pretty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A fun city builder with lofty ideas of having several cities working together.  Fun to play as one city but you quickly need to expand and specialise and here the game just falls apart.  Servers frequently refuse to sync your cities meaning although one has surplus power and the other has surplus water they won't buy from each other.  The AI is hilariously bad, pathfinding is more reminiscent of an 80's game than a modern sim.  Will review my score in a month! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Always on connection and server problems are bad but they'll be fixed. The worst thing about the game, and something that not many people have even acknowledged is the map size: it's stupidly small!! I had pretty much accomplished everything I wanted to within a few hours and filled every square inch of land. And no,  it's called 'Simcity', not 'Simcities' so I don't want to have to make a whole lot of small crappy cities and have them 'interconnected'. They just had to make a slightly updated and better version of Simcity 4 and they would of made millions of people happy, and millions of dollars. Why reboot what's not broken?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I realize that most negative reviews posted here have been regarding the DRM and always online requirement. While I'll agree that has been a major nuisance and limitation to the game, there's more absent from this game than just the simple inability to play when one chooses (a major flaw in its own right).

First, the game has a very limiting feel to it. I've played SimCity since version 1.0 in the early nineties and not since that version have I felt so boxed in. The city size, the method for which zones are laid down, the size and scale of certain city facilities. There seems to be no organic aspect to this game, and it brings back memories of the Societies debacle from a few years ago. From SC4, I could build a network of major roads and then spray a large residential zone within a major road loop and all of the smaller streets would auto create (sometimes with a bit of frustration, but nonetheless). In the new SC, I spend most of my time redesigning road layouts to maximize the usage of my zones.

Build your city your way is simply not the case. And while I don't want this to be a rant on the city size, it cannot be ignored. We've gone from small cities in SC1 to medium cities SC2000 to all-out metropolises in SC4. Part of the excitement and what has kept me occasionally going back to a 10 year old game in SC4 is the almost hobby nature associated with building and cultivating a large, mega city with all of the intricacies, challenges, and endless opportunities for uniqueness. The new Simcity completely fails in this regard as the new city size feels almost claustrophobic. It would be one thing if the region seemed more connected, but instead it feels like you're building a vacuum that has some distant connection to a far away land. You have almost zero control on designing the connection between one neighboring city to another, that's already been done for you.

The online integration of this game has created unending frustration. No ability to locally save is the big negative for me. I recognize the desire for a server connection for DRM or other reasons, but not allowing me to save my game locally just opens up EA to constant complaints about lost game saves, etc. This is extremely frustrating (as I've already lost 3 cities to the apparent server outage of 3/6).

I've often explained Simcity to non Simcity players as the modern version of collecting model trains. It is not really a computer game, but more of digital hobby machine. A place where creativity and design can be tested in real-world with mathematics and simulation. This new Simcity completely misses that mark. While its pretty, it fails as the open creative world so well mastered in its last true previous iteration. Furthermore, the simulation engine appears to fail at creating an accurate sim environment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA have done it again.. made a great promotion of the new simcity. make it all fine and shiny.. But what the hell is wrong with these people! This game is not anything near done. The game is pretty much broken. It have so huge great potential. but the the greed from EA just goes to new levels once again. They don't even understand the backfire they make on them self.
For many years i haven't bought anything that have EA on the cover. i know how much crappy beta games they pop out. Just can't support it.. But i ended up falling for this simcity trap. Its so sad how great the fundamental of this game is. But just get completely broken by EA profit run..
TO ALL... DON'T SUPPORT EA GAMES 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Connection Issues
-----------------
No problems getting into the game at all although it does lose connection to the servers fairly regularly. While this doesn't prevent gameplay you are forced to keep the game running because if you quit the game before it reconnects the you will lose your progress since the last save.

Having said that it did take two days before the 'buy' button on the website worked without giving a 'server error'

Saved Games
-----------
I'm not aware of any indication of when it actualy saves the game. But it does often fail to do so meaning you have to redo your work again when you next login.

Map Size
--------
I agree map sizes are way to small. To the extent it limits creativity and in my experience pushes you to playing each map in the same way. I do wonder if the beta was limited to 1 hour to avoid people realising this.

Game speed
-------------
Currently the game is limited to a max speed of 24 minutes per game day. This is quite important as it happens. If you play the game like I prefer to, start slow and build my city then you will spend many many hours just waiting for your cash to increase enough for your next purchase.
On the other hand you can take the other approach (the one I feel you are forced to take)  spam the entire map with residential and commercial with just enough industry and ignore all but the vital services (ie water and power). Then sit back and wait until you have lots of cash, demolish your city and build it how you wanted it in the first place. Either way there is a lot of waiting around doing nothing.

Power and Water system
----------------------
I actually like this aspect of the game, I didn't enjoy having to lay all the pipes and powerlines, too much micromanagement for me. The new system of using the roads for everything works very well for me.

Apart that is from what I assume are bugs. For example  I had my city running along nicely  I left the city and when I came back to it suddenly the game decided that I no longer had a massive excess of power but instead a massive deficit  I had to plop 20 more windmills just to break even???

Bugs
----
The game still contains a number of bugs, mostly minor but some are not, for example you may get locked out of a map due to 'processing' never to be able to play that map again. This of course could in turn screw up your entire region causing many many hours of gameplay to be simply wasted.

Multiplayer
-----------
Sure you can let someone play a map in you region but don't be fooled  this is a single player game. The global market? This boils down to the price you pay when you buy resources. Is it really influenced by other players? I don't know but it really makes no difference. If you need to buy resources then you pay the price the game tells you. That's it.

Disasters
---------
I've never been a fan of these. I don't see anyway of turning them off in a normal game. Why such a big deal? At 24 minutes per game day it took me about 1.5 hours to save for my school  that's 1.5 hours of me doing nothing but let the game run. As soon as I plopped it down and earthquake hit and destroyed it. So I started the wait all over again. Guess what, another earth quake and destroyed again. I had a further three disasters in that session. I estimate about 7 hours gameplay of which about 6.5 hours was just letting the game run to save up money. Which is why you should just use the spam method to build up lots of cash at the start which makes a mockery of the economy in the first place.

Replayability
------------
If I'm honest I was getting bored by the end of my first session but I stuck with it. Overall there is lot of frustration from losing work and even entire maps but the number one problem by far is the tiny map size which limits creativity and gameplay possibilities. I'm going to give the game a little more time but I do feel I've got pretty much all I'm going get from it  a far cry from past sim city games which I would play for months if not years. Always Online
--------------
I didn't buy Diablo because of this but took a chance here. From what I understand things like map size and game speed and limited to reduce the load on their servers. The irony is that I bought myself an expensive laptop so I could play all the latest games but for this game I could have stuck with with my old crappy one.

My experience with this game has convinced me that I won't be buying any more games that require this, at least, not for a single player game.

Overall
-------
If you are on the fence then wait until the price comes down before you consider trying it  it is WAY overpriced at the moment and certainly not as stable as it should be.

While it certainly a pretty game it is failing to hold my attention. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aside from the always on servers, and the emphasis on social activities over city management, Sim City has failed to provide an intelligent and long lasting simulation.  There are obvious flaws that can be visibly noticed in the algorithms used, and many in-game features are unreliable and random. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I haven't played SimCity in a long time, so I was looking very forward to getting back into the franchise.  So far, I've experienced far more disappointment than satisfaction.    #1, because of the always online DRM, your ability to play the game at any given time rests squarely in the hands of EA.  You're essentially leasing the game from them, you're not buying it, it's not yours.   #2, it's has a SINGLE PLAYER GAME component that still has always online DRM.  It's conceptually ridiculous when a single player game relies on a 3rd party in order to even work.   #3, when I finally got in, I initially enjoyed playing the game.  The aspects of city-building are pretty deep.  The downside quickly became apparent;  there's no room to build sprawling cities like with past titles.

.....  #4, make no mistake, this is designed to be a multiplayer game where a collective ground of people each contributes to an overall goal for a region.  I prefer to play the single player component, but in its current state, that isn't very good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought the game because, even though I got screwed by Diablo 3, I figured I'd give EA one chance.

So far, they have blown it--the game is unplayable. It gets two stars because the time I have been able to play it, it has been very fun. I will adjust my score if I can get one week without problems, but in the meantime, the low score will serve as a message to EA that they NEED to get their act together. This is unacceptable and bordering on fraud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really do feel slighted having purchased this game.

I have now spent more time attempting to play this game than actually playing it.  When I can play it, I'm unsure of the status of my game, will it be saved and playable later?  The answer is that I don't know because I've lost more cities than I've kept and there's no feedback to the player.

I also fear for the long term future of this game, not replay-ability mind you... but playability.  EA is renowned for closing down online features of games after their popularity dwindles, will this happen to my beloved SimCity as well in 5 years... 10 years?

If I could go back I would, and because I can't I will change my habits: No longer will I support any media that uses online only DRM. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Always on, internet connection required SINGLE PLAYER GAME! Pass on this one guys, You'll get maybe 10 hours of gameplay out of it before you're bored. It's still SimCity, but not the way you want to remember it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We should open class action lawsuits against those companies. I few like asking for refund is not enough. I bought a product that didn't work and the manual nor the manufacturer can solve. It´s like buying a ticket for a show and the band didn't show off, so they send some lame local cover band. Maybe is time to gamers start to demand quality over achievements. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately, the game remains unplayable. An unplayable game (3 days after launch), gets a 0. Even if all were fine, the manual indicates a dumbed down city building experience.

Given Spore, and The Sims  Medieval, it really looks like Maxis is slumping. Also, given the revenue EA has made off The Sims DLC, I suspect they intended to make Sim City a cash cow with similar add-ons (and attempting to "protect" it through ridiculous DRM). Who knows, maybe they can turn it around. I know other games that required always on Internet, and they changed it. But, I doubt EA will, even if their game tanks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too much forced structure to be SimCity as we knew it.  Cities are very small and meant to rely on each other for services and buildings.  Once city cannot do more than one or two things.  Even "sandbox" mode doesn't change this.  No way to save a city, try something out, and then go back to the earlier version if you don' t like it.  I am very disappointed as at the start of a new city it feels like a great update of the old games.  Social should have been an optional extra not forced to be the entire game.  They broke the game for single player because they needed the restrictions to get multiplayer to work.  If you don't want multiplayer this SimCity (5) is not for you.
I do not like that it requires a constant connection to the servers, if it loses connection it doesn't save and it will eventually kick you out of your city (and not save it).  Someone took a great game and broke it trying to figure out how to make more money out of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First, let me begin by clarifying that a product should be reviewed in all its functions. If I enter a restaurant and the food is excellent but the service is terrible, I can factor the poor service in to the review because it is certainly part of the experience. In the same way that if a game has a bug, it can rightly factor in to your review.
The game play is good, but not earth-shattering. The mechanics are polished but 'softened' enough that veteran players may feel unattended to. Not getting to play a game that I purchased because of issues I have no culpability for, is NOT okay. As consumers, we continue to capitulate more and more and accept this as standard practice. We shouldn't. This is ESPECIALLY true when they make  no attempt to compensate you for lapses: "Couldn't play for a week? Here's a free dlc item." Ultimately we continue to send a message that we will digest anything regardless of the flaws.
I'm sorry but an amusing game in no way makes up for a product that is too broken to properly work. All moral context aside, my score is a reflection of SERVICE LEVELS and GAMEPLAY combined. I'm rating the 'experience of investing my time in to simcity', and so far, it sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loaded the game the night before, took an HOUR at least to load. Then it updated another hour, THEN the servers were busy.
Finally got on in the morning. Slow and clunky. Servers busy AGAIN, then the game drops the connection to the server???  did I lose my information???
Simcity 4 was great, I eventually had to cut the disk in half because I was spending TOO much time on it.  With this UNPLAYABLE game my time is my own. A $60 game should not have you waiting in a que. With all the power of computers and memory and gig's  one should be able to play stand alone and then go to the server to update WHEN I WANT TO. where can I get my money back???
and supposedly my graphics card is not powerful enough also???

Real Amateur hour Maxis... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although this game could have been something amazing. EA and maxis decided they wanted more money... so they added DRM.... the maps are too small for building space and on top of that Maxis developers lied to us by saying the game needed an online connection. Don't buy this game, I do not recommend it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The gameplay is disappointing, it seems that the residents (sims) populate your city whatever you do correctly or incorrectly. The mayor of the city can put a landfill in the middle of the city but residents continue to arrive in the city! I think it is just simulation and realistic, I am very disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The online DRM I can get past. Kinda pissed I won't be able to play anymore once ea decides its no longer worth their time, but overall not that big of a deal. The big problem though is the fact that I can't play for longer than 10 minutes before it crashes. In addition, it took me an hour before I could get it to work since it redirected me to a non-working tutorial over and over again until I reset the mini-tutorial option by chance. After that it randomly let me get back to my city. All of this was after having to try about 15 times to create a city and getting an error message telling me to try again.

The tiny map size is annoying, and if I ever get to play for any length of time, I'll be able to accurately evaluate that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although the game itself is amazing it really doesn't mean anything when you can't play it. Between the massive problems EA had getting the game to even release to the issues where you wait 20 min in a queue just to have it reset or allow you to join for an endless loading screen. Although you expect issues with a day 1 release those bugs usually still let you play the game, such as endless audio loops or menus disappearing which I have had happen in Simcity. People would be willing to deal with always online DRM if it actually let us play the game we paid $60. I hope that EA offers some sort of credit or in game items for all of the mess. If not I'll just go buy the physical copy if I buy it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a waste of time and money, and the fact that they're BLATANTLY LYING about having fixed servers and are not doing ANYTHING to compensate for this massive failure of a launch is an enormous slap in the face. The game was actually really fun for the few hours i got to play, after waiting 4 hours to install a game FROM A DISC because i needed to connect to the servers to install it for some stupid reason, and before the server crashed and I lost MY ENTIRE CITY. The fact that it forces you be be always online was a horrible mistake on EAs part. This isn't an MMO its a single player city simulation. Their customer service is non-existent and the announcements being given by the company saying that servers are patched and running have all been false.  Absolutely ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If your looking to play a sim town game that you can rarely play because of server issues, cannot save, and crashes regularly then you are in luck.  Otherwise, stay away.  How does EA stay in business producing this stuff?  We all must just be sheep to them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When you purchase a game, you should be able to play it when it is released. If a game cannot be made available to the customers, the game should not be released. Ive tried for hours to get in, to no avail. Always online DRM needs to go the way of the dodo. Such a shame 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

DRM aside (which I don't support but can live with) this game is not what you'd expect from the the creators of simcity 4. I first actually got to play 2 days after purchase due to server issues but what I found is a game that is better suited for Facebook, I have little creativity in city creation and I have to start where they pre determine my highway connection is. The city I create very very quickly fills its boarders and the topography is non adjustable which wouldn't be so bad of the game wasn't 2km by 2km, I mean come on I want an in depth opportunity to be the creative city building nerd I always dreamed of but I find myself much more satisfied with building in tropico than this game and they don't even have a sewer system to build or subways.... Oh wait neither does simcity 5 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Server overload can be a bummer when you try to play the new SimCity, along with the myriad of different bugs that will probably break most complex cities on their attempt to succeed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is fine, I mean, it works for the most part. The layout is bad, control over the cities is limited. City size is too small. It has crashed 2 times. Certainly not worth $80. Maybe worth $25. This is the last time I will ever pre-order a game. I think I will go back to sim city 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I originally reviewed this game on day two after the North American release. I rated it 7 out of 10. I am changing my review to a 2 out of 10.

When I first reviewed the game, there were serious server issues. While they are still lingering, and servers are constantly coming down and back up daily, the game is now at least playable for an extended amount of time. In my original review, I praised the graphics, interface, deep simulation, and the way they mesh together. I stand by my assessment of the graphics and interface. However, upon playing the game uninterrupted for several hours, as well as doing number crunching, and reading other accounts of people doing the same kinds of observations I have been, I've come to the conclusion that the simulation is not nearly as deep as it appears. One of the great features touted by the developers in this game was the 'GlassBox' engine, which supposedly has literally thousands of 'sims' (citizens of your city) being simulated on the EA servers, which allows a realistic and complex city to emerge on your screen without users needing to own a supercomputer. This conveniently provided their rationale for requiring a constant connection to their servers at all times even while playing single player. This is manifestly false. You can physically disconnect your internet from your computer while playing and the supposedly server-side simulation continues to hum along without a hitch. My complaint here is not about the requirement of the internet connection (though there are many reasons to dislike it), but by the completely invented reasoning behind its inclusion.

In addition to this complaint, there are an entire host of client-side issues which are either bugs, or simply non-features to begin with. The supposedly intelligent traffic system in which "everyone has a home and a workplace unless unemployed", is also false. The "simulation" does not simulate actions of the sims, it simply spawns cars and moves them around in a fashion which would *appear* to show a collection of individual behaviors. Essentially, it "simulates" the simulation. The same can be said for the industrial system, in which supposedly residents work and produce goods, which are then shipped off to businesses to be sold to citizens that made money working & producing other goods. This is also false. Despite showing lots of big numbers when you look at your population statistics regarding "shipped freight", "goods sold" etc, these are essentially arbitrary numbers based on the population of your city (which also over time becomes greatly inflated compared to the number of actual "sims" visible moving about your city) and the makeup of your zones which you have placed. The businesses do not recieve shipments from industry, they restock automatically at the beginning of each game day, regardless of the availability of goods either in your city or your region. It is entirely possible and workable to have a city with zero industry and only residents and shops, with no imports, exports, or production, but the city will "thrive" on. In short, the much touted "depth" of simulation is a complete sham. The real achievement by Maxis is the ability of the game to pull the wool over your eyes and show you what purports to be a much more realistic and complex simulation than previous SimCity titles  when in fact, the game is far simpler, less realistic, more limited, and worst of all, dysfunctional to the core. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe i will rerate when its finished in a year or so. but at present, a month after release its still an unfinished mess with small city zones, crippling traffic issues and limited playability. Online only is a pita 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not bad! Sure, the always online DRM is awful and very annoying considering my internet clunks out every once in a while, and it doesn't save on to your computer, but other than that it is not bad. It is a very addicting game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All the critic reviews were written by people who got to play the game when there were no server issues. EAs current shortcoming in terms of servers and customer support mean that you should definitely not buy it in its current state. If you are considering buying it right now just know that  You WILL have log in issues, crashes and re-rolls and NO, you will not get your money back because EA refuses to refund anyone. The game is good but the DRM just ruins it for everyone. Be patient and wait for EA to fix this. On the other hand you could boycott them for horrible business practices that have brought them this far in terms of relations with fans of the Sim City games. Up to you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

SimCity is supposed to be THE city simulation game. Unfortunately, it has been corrupted by the scourge of EA.

The only redeeming features are a beautiful environment created by the GlassBox engine and breaking the grid, and for those I give 2 points above 0. This is after the most grievous bugs of the tacked-on 'MMO features' which were preventing the game from actually running have been resolved.

It is a huge step back from the features and gameplay of SimCity 4. The simulation is super-shallow and there is zero challenge and the game becomes boring pretty fast, and largely forgettable.

Stuff which should have been there from day 1 is missing, and we can see already the DLC on the pipeline just to give us what should be there in the first place. The number one on this list are BIGGER CITIES; seriously, each land patch is the size of a neighbourhood.

The writing is on the wall, it is just a matter of time until it becomes a The Sims-like monstrosity with 10+ DLC that would cost upwards of $500 to have the complete game, plus optionally buying in-game currency. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am sure it has been said a million times, but any fun this game provides is killed by the small map size.  Your map fills up extremely fast and then you really can't do anything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is garbage. I don't even want to talk about how the game requires an internet connection to start. Today it's the third time i start a city just to see it disappear after some  errors" or disconnections.
Waste of money and time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to keep this short and simple. This game fails to work properly, if my city isn't being rolled back for the hundredth time then my highways either stop working or work contrary to how you would expect them to. Also add to the fact that the always online DRM, eventually the servers will be shutdown and this game will never be able to played again. Only benefit was I scored Dead Space 3 as a consolation prize. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with the mean of the user score, even if I'm a professional reviewer and I've to give it a vote near 6 (55). I TRIED to play it at day one with the problems you witnessed. Then tried to play it after update 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. No way, SimCity is fundamentally broken. A piece of s**t, in other words. Will Wright, please make it properly (better than SC4!) via Kickstarter, we'll finance it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Looking for a decent modern city building game??

Buy Cities: Skylines. It is everything that EA failed to deliver with Sim City, basically after playing Skylines the  flaws in this game are amplified for all to see. This was not the game everyone wanted and expected, sorry EA but I won't be looking back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I unfortunately got suckered in and bought this game, the community is as good as dead. Still no leader boards or stats, a lot of promised game features still haven't been properly implemented, and server stability is a joke. I have had 3 cities i spent hours on just disappear for no reason. The 3 regions i play in, all my neighbors show ''Last online 3+ weeks ago'' Yeah.... That kind of speaks for itself.. THE GAME IS DEAD  I tried to get a refund from Origin support with no luck. Buyer beware... You will punch yourself in the head repeatedly if you buy this 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was terrible. It was a bad write-off of the old (and good) SimCity. I am very disappointed, and the fact that it has DRM makes it even worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok i really want to enjoy this game, it looks good, i like the mechanics BUT THE ALWAYS ONLINE DRM is not for SimCity.  And EA being EA this game will go offline and be unplayable in a few years.  Thats not worth it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot believe SC5 is this game. The cities are ridicoulous little, you'cant expand...there are not underground like in SC4...the traffic is not sustainable due to skycrapers in a little village...water, even close to the sea run out easily and people left city because of no water  this is ridicolous, in real life this is never going to happen). If you put a nuclear power station then radioactivity kills everyone in the sorrounding in few months... this is absolutely not real life!!!! Who was the diretor of this game? probably a kid of 4 years old could have done better job. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The premise has been lost with this game, with a name like Sim City you want to create just that. A vibrant metropolis of large scale.   Unfortunately this has been lost forever now it seems. Maps are smaller then ever and while it has many great features these are virtually the same as the four games before it. The innovation that was promised really isn't there.  The game forces you more so then ever to link your city to neighbors which I felt was the fundamental flaw in Sim City 4.  Everything under one roof so to speak now doesn't work.  The choice isn't even there and has been simply removed.  The are bugs and I had to hard restart the game on two occasions due to crashes.  These didn't seem linked either so two hard restart bugs on launch isn't good at all.  The biggest issue so far is the constant connecting to server issues associated with the needlessly over the top DRM.  This function shouldn't make a game non-playable but it does.  It kind of shocking that EA are so over-protective now that they will willingly hamper a players experience.   I hope this is quickly patched.  If so my rating will be higher, but in its current state the game is verging on unplayable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Content-wise it is a really nice game  very engaging and motivating, despite the criticism regarding map size or similar issues. If however I pay 80€ for a digital download of a game which is not an MMO and I am absolutely unable to play the game, lose progress on cities because connections are extremely unstable even 24h after launch something is very wrong with the deal... The two beta were meant to evaluate server load prior to the release  did they act on that? It seems that no: In the server list there is a total of 4 servers dedicated for european users next to US and pacific servers. Since EA is apparently that cheap, they´ll get an appropriate score from me... Don´t buy the game (now). At least wait. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Extremely buggy and servers keep going offline, causing me to loose entire cities. In game AI is absolutely terrible, certain building upgrades are very hard to build for no apparent reason, and there are other design issues as well such as some buildings being useless such as the nuclear power plant because it simply floods your city with radiation no matter what you do. Nuclear power doesn't work anything like that in real life. Also city sizes are annoyingly tiny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sim City has really flopped, even if you remove the server issues from the equation. I feel really bad for the guys at Maxis who had to make the game like this, I have a feeling that it wasn't their decision. Over the last two days I've managed to play for about 10 hours on the Europe West 2 server despite the horrible server problems, and I'm already getting bored with the game. Having spent thousands of hours to all of the previous versions of Sim City, that is a surprise I didn't expect when paying 60€ for the game. At 6€/h that is a pretty steep price for two frustrating days of queuing to the servers and constantly being afraid to loose your progress.

Severe points reduction from the city sizes that are probably the most crippling aspect of this game. The current map is full to the edges after only few hours of play and you get a claustrophobic feeling in the game with no space to expand. Moving to second region just postpones it a few hours and frustration returns even stronger when it also runs out of space. Your city looks like a downtown of a real city that's cut out from a larger entity with real suburbs and all that nice surrounding built area. Developers say that the choice was made so that even low end PCs could play the game. I don't understand why they couldn't use the same approach that has been taken in Sim City 4: variable size maps. You just pick the map that your PC can handle when it's maxed out and that's it. If the choice was too large one, try again with a smaller one. Problem solved. It's annoying how the developers are trying to explain away design decisions with "pretend logic" and hoping that players don't notice. I'm guessing most likely the orders came from above to limit the city sizes for some future DLC release. Or some other crap like that. I just want to refuse to believe a serious game designer wouldn't notice how much the city size limit affects the game experience.

Lots of minus from roads, somehow all the fun is missing from building the roads because of the minuscule city sizes and lack of choice on how to connect to neighboring cities. That's a shame because building roads and designing road networks has always been one of the key aspects of Sim City.  It's also annoying how you have to upgrade all your roads to high density because otherwise your city just won't grow in population, and then you have a city with only high buildings. Having the curvy roads is great, but doesn't compensate for all the other lacks.

To add insult to injury, there is the always on DRM that doesn't let me choose when to save regions, or allow me to reload regions at previous states. I don't have possession of my own save games from private region where I'm the only player. The pollution that crosses city boundaries into neighboring cities and abandoned city slots pretty much guarantees that I have no intention to play on public regions where I can't control actions of the other cities.

The game is pretty and smooth, credits for that. The simulation engine seems to work nicely. But I'm not going to spend hundreds of hours to this game just because it looks pretty and I can follow each Sim around in the city. It must be fun to play, the City Building must be the primary activity and the current version just isn't any of that. Many of official reviews said the game is a lot of fun. I disagree.

Looking at how EA did their calculations about the required amount of servers to support their player base,  it seems that they need at least 4-8 times more server capacity to do the job than estimated. After the doubling of the initial capacity that I've seen today, the servers are still completely bogged even with the cheetah speed and game features disabled. So here's an interesting thought to ponder: How much is EA willing to spend on running these servers for an extended period? How many hours of server time at amazon did my 60€ buy? At what point is EA going to decide that it's time to pull the plug or they will start loosing money for every hour I spend on this game? Their initial estimates on the server costs were 4-8 times under the mark, and you can bet your house on it that EA is not going to allow Sim City to add to the red side of their balance sheet if the investors have any say on it. Be prepared to make a door stop from your Sim City DVD much sooner than you thought, this one is not going to be kicking for 10 years like it's predecessor. Please, don't repeat my mistake and support this horrible business model of always on-line single player games that pretend to be serious multi-player games to get your moneys. I would ask for my money back, but apparently EA doesn't refund games bought from Origin. Thanks EA for ruining Sim City. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a long time fan of the series (Played every one including the original).  I fell into the trap of thinking that the complaints weren't justified.  Well they are.   The game is so close to being a real great title, but has too many gamebreaking flaws.  Always on DRM. I feel dirty for paying for this since I have balked at other titles for this very reason.  At first I thought the small city sizes was just a style preference, but I then realized it was a cover for the horrible pathfinding, which unfortunatly hinders not just traffic, but power,water,etc.  I think this game still has a chance at redemption, but unless they clean this mess up, pass on it and save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really like the idea and concept that no city lives in a vacuum, and the game attempts to reflect that by including multiplayer elements of cooperation with municipal services and competition in global trade of commodities, but in terms of the simulation it feels like it's "SimCity Lite". There were many features that were central to the SimCity franchise that got cut out in the name of "streamlining" i.e. plan your own highway off-ramp locations, tiny plot size, terraforming, etc. Sure, the much-vaunted Glassbox simulation engine that tracks the activity of every individual sim promises a more "accurate simulation", but it's moot when so many aspects of the game's AI behave like retards. Traffic goes into a standstill even if you spend 75% of your budget on public transport if you commit the crime of having more than 5 intersections in your main arteries. Someone even proved how pants-on-head retarded the traffic AI is by making a city out of one single winding snake road spread out across the lot, and managed to have a successful city because of it because 0 intersections  0 gridlock. vOv

I really want to like the game and the synergy it promotes, but unfortunately there are many things that need to be done for the game to be a success. The Always-Online system is not necessarily a DRM, but also something in-built to the game that had poorly thought-out execution. It failed to account for the contingency that someone's game would disconnect, and does not have an offline save that could be uploaded to the cloud the next time the player reconnects to the server (Diablo III and StarCraft II had that, at least). EA/Maxis also failed to properly stress test in their popular beta stages, and additionally they were piss poor in their communication to their players when they were attempting to sort out their server woes.

On top of the always-online stuff, the game itself is in need of a significant overhaul. Traffic AI needs to be fixed. The RCI indicator is a lie  after 2 days of playing and finding out that zoning according to the RCI indicator did nothing for my economy, I clicked on my population window and found everything I needed to know in the detail tab. I then decided to ignore everything the game was telling me through RCI and the ingame prompts, and did much better in my subsequent cities. There are just way too many aspects of the game that were either because of poor design decisions and poor execution that kind of border on amateurish. Somehow, I think that this SimCity 2013 has become a deeply wounding blow to Maxis's reputation. Lots of fanbois will protest and say that Maxis is perfect, and EA is at fault. But I've been observing this game for a long time, and Maxis is just as complicit as EA in this, from the Online Lead being a Maxis staffer to Maxis designers themselves who wanted the always-online concept to begin with. Lots of people who have been playing Maxis games since the 90s have since lost their trust in Maxis, and it can only go downhill from here. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you can't guess why, please look above or below me. Its the SAME. DAMN. ISSUE. Its one thing to have a bad game, its another to gave an unplayable game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Had high hopes, but was disappointed by several things. Obviously the connection issues and launch problems, but those are temporary issues for the most part. Overall I was was most annoyed by limited city size, and what seems like watered down tools. Multi-player isn't my thing so I'm forced to manage several small "cities" to get every thing going, which only makes the annoying load times when switching that much more annoying. I live in a rural area and the occasional drop in connection is expected, losing work to server issues is frustrating. Thankfully I purchased through Amazon and got my refund. The graphics are good and when it works it was ok. Launch issues, limited size, and the likelihood of paying to increase that size through DLC, limited life of the game, and terrible communication by EA are the reason for my rating. I won't complain about the DRM masked as multi-player/server side processing, but that isn't a plus. BTW roughly half the PRO Reviews where done on EA's private server before launch, and polygon lowered it's score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am done with EA. Simcity is worse then Aliens and Duke Nukem. The always online DRM is awful and my internet isn't very good so it crashes a lot. The city is smallllllllllllll and the AI is terrible. Origin is awful.  you EA I am giving my next 60 dollars to Valve 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is kinda fun without all the issues with the connection and servers, etc. However, the space you have now is very limited and it is the biggest flaw in the gameplay as you can build a whole metropolis in less than a day. The mechanics are fun, but I cannot compare them to another simcity unfortunately. Also, stupid DLCs and crappy graphics (unless you have a REALLY powerful PC) make it a complete letdown. It definitely is not worth ANY money, even for the hardcore fans as it will frustrate you more than it will amuse you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Had high hopes for the game, but it's now nearly day 4 after release and the game remains, for the most part, unplayable. Even in the few hours I was able to get on, I was discouraged by the prohibitively small city size.  From the lack of refunds, to the full servers, to the 2+ hour waits for customer service via phone/chat, I am sorely disappointed with this release. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have been very excited for this game, in fact this is the first EA game for me in a very long time.  Coming from many MMO's I expect server outages, patching, etc.  However I do feel that EA/Maxis brought this on themselves with lack luster beta testing.  The fact is they only allowed for beta for a total of two days separated by 2 weeks each time and only allowed you the play the game for 1 hour and not all the features worked.  So what to do you...servers not properly tested. The whole "you need internet to play this game because real cities need outsides" is BS.  This game should of had an option to play online or offline.  How is it that I create a city (mark it as private) and don't allow anyone to join but me any different then playing offline?  Its not.  The fact is the game is 100% online because EA/Maxis wants to make it hard to steal the game.

Over the past 48 hours I have clocked in a total of 3 hours of actual play time due to server issues and login problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA strikes again with its dumb buisness strategies. Forced Online DRM, Day one DLC, and preorder items (That cost 20 dollars more) making a large change in the game? Yeah, they did it all. I don't blame maxis for this, I'm sure EA took the wipe and threatened them, so instead of raging at the creators, I'll rage at the publishers. Warning, If you are here looking for a review of the game, don't look beyond this point, it'll mostly be the glaring flaws of the game.

Online DRM  One word: Stupid. Who thought this was a good idea? It literally does nothing good for the game, considering pirates have always found a way around DRM. Preorder Items: I'm fine with changed in apperance (Hats for example) and things similiar but for 20 extra dollars, you get a few items that change the game COMPLETELY. Day one DLC: I don't even need to say anything, if its done the first day, it should be in the game. Its that simple.
Now, I've never pirated anything in my life, but the actions EA takes make me want to pirate every single game they publish  so once again, good job EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

EA's servers are the biggest issue.  Selecting a server, syncing with it and actually playing a game is seemingly impossible.  If you are lucky enough to even get that far, look forward to playing for 15-30 minutes before the server is disrupted, in which case you will likely be disconnected.  After being disconnected you may or may not lose your progress, and may or may not be able to log back in for hours at a time.  Do not waste your time or money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've played SIM City 4 for years, total addict. I eagerly picked up the pre-release for this version from Amazon. I let the update run overnight (and it was still running this morning), and now I can't even find an open server. In all fairness, I was able to actually get into the game for almost 10 minutes before the game closed without warning. I have no idea whether my stuff was saved because, 3 hours later, I still can't get back in. I just want to build cities. I guess I'll go back to my old version for a while until this gets 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here is a game that might actually be fin if I could log in to play it.  Terrible implementation of DRM.  Always online really goes against what Simcity always was to me a game you play on a long trip.  In the middle of the night when you should be studying or sleeping.  Why force people to play online, if you want to have DRM then have it save  login occasionally not all the time at least, I want to keep playing when your servers don't work or when you decide to get rid of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I want to play the game. That is the problem, with major server issues this game is unplayable.  When I did get a chance to play I had a blast. I cannot in good faith give this game a good review based just on the game play, it must be given as much of a review on the whole product that has been delivered and that includes the persistent online features. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is OK when it's playable, but beyond not being available most of the time, it still has issues. Single player isn't really possible unless you create multiple cities in a region. I couldn't bring any of my plans to fruition with just a single city, so I had to make a fake city to supply some services to the main one. I'm also almost out of space at maybe 30k people. Of course, I haven't been able to play it much because it hasn't been available much. Many, many, many issues with server availability and bugginess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun when you can play... unfortunately you cant. This game will be plagued by always-online bull for the entire time its relevant. Its sad but true. Simcity is a single player game at heart. Stop pushing for online BS because tis has obviously failed you.

AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fun game when you can actually play it. Unfortunately, this is rare because of the badly implemented attempt at online-only DRM masked as multiplayer. When you finally manage to connect to the overloaded servers, there is a good chance that your city will not load, any work done to your city will not be saved, or you will be randomly disconnected and forced to wait in the queue again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not buy this game for now. The servers are unstable and always crash, the always online will mean you will have to either wait in que for long periods of time or not be able to log in at all but if you do and try to claim a city it might become corrupt later on, losing you those precious hours spent upon building your master piece. EA has done a horrible job with the games stability. It is sad because the gameplay is very smooth, bright and addicting just like the previous Simcity games except with more complexity and better graphics. Maxis is also at fault here and should take as much responsibility as EA. They have agreed to the always online DRM and EA hosting their servers and have yet paralyzingly allowed people to pre-order and deny people their games. Unless you want to do a card dispute of your purchase then I suggest either waiting for an offline patch, either official or not or just sticking to the good old Simcity 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst game launches I have seen. I would not recommend playing the game at this time.  Problems logging into the server, not being able to find a city that you've spent 3 hours building.  In my opinion the DRM is not the problem but the launch has been terribly executed.  To save time and frustration it would probably be in most peoples' interest not to try playing for a month until the server issues are resolved.  Too bad that you can't get your money back for this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

YAY! managed to play 45min on EE 3, now cant get back in.  THANKS EA!
if i cant play this game now? how about 5 years from now?  this is horrible launch, also even if this was a perfect launch, the city size is about the same size as a stamp. they better fix city size soon, and for free. this might be my last EA game, even ubisoft seems better these days, and ubisoft is terrible.
ranting ranting ranting 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

0.0After releasing a rushed , **** , disappointing game like DA2, I tried to trust them when they said they were "listening to the fans" to make "what they want" ****This DLC is pointless, over-priced , simple and not worth wasting your money or BiowarePoints on it.But I must say that DA2 original game is so **** bad that even this simple "Legacy" crap has a better story. Won't be buying another DA2 DLC unless it is like 100 times better than this one. 10â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bioware missed a major opportunity to win back some fans that were disappointed with DAII. Not that this wasn't a good attempt at DLC, but the fact that Bioware expects us to pay $10 for the DLC after the majority of us felt cheated. If it were a free release, as sort of an apology for the redundancy of the main story, no question that I would give this a 10. But as a $10 download, it's linear and unimaginative an give little incentive to play as it doesn't really involve your characters (except Varric) or give reference to the original game whose character we all felt a more personal connection with than the Hawke character because of limited choice. I'm you're wondering whether or not this is worth it, pass it up and wait for the Witcher 2 on 360. All Witcher 2 dlc has been promised as free. Hint, hint Bioware. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game should not exist even logically. But logic aside, there's just nothing new, they just enhanced destruction physics a bit (and there's not much different) and added Jason Statehem (is that right?). Rushed story with not really polished gameplay equals - unworthy of it's first game sequel that must be avoided by any FPS or Sci-fi fans. Seriously, i passed through it, like after 4 hours, A.I. is broken and it's hard to die even if you'll try to, It's one of the first games, that used regeneration and you're just invincible there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, this is officially an anti-recommendation… The Random Encounter was released to promote Serious Sam 3, fair enough… Unfortunately it’s truly awful… Serious Sam as an RPG should just not have been attempted! He doesn't suit the format; the game isn't fun and of course being a turn based RPG makes game-play rapidly slow, Serious Sam should not be seriously slow… This is a short game of nine levels, it’s safe to say I didn't (or couldn't) attempt to complete this as it just didn't grab me in any way! People who enjoy RPG’s may perhaps enjoy this title; but it’s pretty much choose a gun pick a direction or distance and select “OK”. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I might give this game a much better rating if I could play it. It has so many game-stopping bugs I've had to restart 4 times today. I bought this game a year ago, and gave up on the controls after an hour. I pulled it off the shelf today, dusted it off, and decided to get my money out of it. My keyboard refuses to respond on the map screen, and some bug keeps me from reaching the second island. PLUS the game keeps crashing at a certain point on the map screen whether I reload or not. Is it too late to get my money back? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yippeee!!!!!!!!! Another crappy fps to use as a coaster for my den! This game defines the phrase piss-poor. The graphics are so dated I had to check my calendar to see if I wasn't having a flashback of a bad experience in 1998. And where did they record these voice actors at? Was it via satellite? This game has a wretched score and the grainiest voice clips I've heard on XBox. Controls are awful, the single-player missions are completely unoriginal, and the multiplayer experience is unworthy of the "Unreal" title. In summation, this game brings nothing to the table that hasn't been done 900 times, and is just poorly executed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game's premise was interesting, however, very poorly executed. The game is a cheap (and bad) rip off of Diablo 3. I tried out the mage and the abilities were pretty much just poorly redone mage abilities from D3. Not to mention the UI and the way the loot drops/gold look. 2/10 glad I didn't spend money on this game.

The Grinding Quest for Mediocre Loot

First of all, I am playing this game since closed beta, and have around 150 hours poured into it.

In closed beta game was kinda ok, they had some bad choices with spending real cash, but I never cared about it and haven't seen it as game-breaking. But, after 15th of February of this year, game got a complete overhaul, they wiped all progress (which they promised they wont, but screw customers right?) and made this game an insult to anyone who played it.

Game is repetitive, has bad balance and terrible mechanics. Let me explain.

Progression is painfully slow. Amount of cash you need to upgrade your castle is equivalent to raiding 50+ castles for 1 building ( talking about levels 15+).

Their crown system is "worked on" for 2 years now (crowns are something like rating, elo, whatever). They have no clue how to fix it, and never will. For instance, if you have 700 crowns, which means you are not so bad and you've done well with your attacks and defenses, and you attack SAME LEVEL castle with 300 crowns, you will gain 5 crowns for victory, and lose 30 crowns for a loss. This is plainly stupid. On the other hand, if someone lower than you  on a ladder (crowns) attacks you, he will lose lets say 10 crowns if he dies, BUT he can grind your castle over and over again, learning all your secrets, and if he win, he can walk out with NET crowns even if he died 15 times in there. Dying after the first time dos NOT remove extra crowns from the attacker.

Monster balance is terrible. I bet you haven't used or seen at least 50% of monsters in game. Why? Because they are useless.

Some visual themes are simply better than others, and they cost real money. Meaning that some traps are harder to see on some visual styles then on another.

Game rewards brain-dead style of castle design. Placing all your monsters in 1 room, supported with tons of traps is most rewarding. ZERO strategy is needed to succeed.

Oh yea. You know how you can win every castle after you learn how traps work and how to avoid them? Aggro all mobs and run back to starting position, they will slowly follow you 1 by 1. You may not get max stars and max crowns for castle, but hey, you will still walk out with gold/life force/crowns.

That brings us to their free build mode, or whatever the hell they call it. Now you can set as many traps as you can in a small area (if they are supported by a generator) and place as many creatures in any room. This means that 99% of all castles in their level bracket are almost identical. There is some kind of soft/hard cap now, so even if you have 40 mobs in 1 room, only certain number of them will activate, while the rest will run away from you till you kill previous ones. This is simply BAD game design.

Oh yea. there is nothing Epic about Epic loot in The Mighty Quest for Epic Loot. Painting a brick purple does not make it epic.

Before Open Beta this game was kinda OK, after OB its down right insulting.

WHOEVER gave this game a good score is part of the dev/promo team or have played it for several hours.

I give it 2/10 because it is actually fun for the first couple of hours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Single player, booring, you have to pay for everything, if you want to be good. Don't try this game, realy, time waste. No Co op, no multiplayer...  you create a castle, somebody load it from net, and try to destroy it. **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mario Sports Mix may be pretty fun, but due to the lack of other fun sports, like tennis, baseball, football, and other fun sports, some sports that are somehow not based on actual sports, and lame voice talents, it is a waste of $50. So I gave it to my class, which has a Wii. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the worst camera in any game I have EVER played. The co-operative mode was awful as it just involved the 2nd player standing on switches. I must of died about 20 times on the same jump because the camera wouldn't straighten up. Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why on earth would they put together such clever writing, great voice acting, and beautiful art and then RUIN IT with that horrible camera? Any time I have to use the "flying" feature, I can't see where I'm going and get killed about 30 times before I can move on. I think I'm just going to re-gift this stupid thing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why? Why would they even release this game? It is poorly put together, boring, hard to control and just simply a really bad game. Don't waste your time. I'm a Trek fan and even this doesn't appeal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't believe these high user reviews - the PC and XBOX versions are identical. This game is inherently flawed and awful, bugs aside, the gameplay is BORING. The ship combat is terrible. This is space invaders set in the star trek universe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never posted commentson here before. However I felt i needed to as this game is rubbish! Being a Star Trek fan I was excited about wning this game however it sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved the first game, hated this one. Buy Splinter Cell (PC version). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first game (Project IGI) was more interesting than IGI-2 covert strike. I have a problem with IGI-2, I bought the game CD and installed it but all the weapons look white (white in color). If anyone has the solution to my problem please email me at: shaheen_khan_4u_20m@yahoo.com I have read all system requirements for IGI-2 and my system holds all of them but still its not running too smooth. But my main problem is with weapons looking white. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is impossible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Repetitive with no new unique element
Randomized map was too big with enemy concentrated at one small corner.
Get bored fast

Doesn't worth the money 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

graphics look great. game is pure garbage though. get 2k6 if you want a fun and great loking game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This DLC is just one massive, badly balanced shoot out that soon gets boring.

After the first 6000 rounds of ammo and 100 stimpaks, you are left wondering why bothered going there at all.

Especially when you go through a door way and there are 5 robots and 3 turrets with guns pointing right at the door at the other side and they all start shooting before the level is even fully loaded.

Still it could be worse, you might kill 1 raider leader after being told you dont have to kill all the raiders, only to find every raider in nuka world turns hostile the second you do that. So you do have to kill every raider in Nuka world.

When girl says the raiders have all gone... dont believe a word of it, they are exactly where you left them. You have wipe them out your self manually. There is no script to handle events in this, its just a simple shootout DLC.

Shoot outs are fun for the first hour... but after 12 hours of endless shooting.... YAWN. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty terrible. The 3rd person puts your character to the bottom left of the screen and camera movement rotates around your character. Extremely disorienting. The graphics are very bland. Police will die from a foot shot but will remain un-phased from 2 shots in the head. Plot might be good later on, but I just couldn't keep playing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

By far the worst product so far by Telltale Games. This is bad both as a game, and as a Game of Thrones adaption.

The good things first. Graphics are mostly OK, voice acting is very good.

The bad things. This ordeal misses the whole point of "choose your own adventure" games, and also makes a complete mess of a glorious opportunity with GoT. The world of Game of Thrones would be a perfect setting for plotting, intrigue, schemes both grand and small; a place where your choices could really count and result in either small victories or horrible calamities. What do we get instead? 6 episodes where you do not get to make a SINGLE decision that would affect the outcome ot things even in the slightest.

And not only that, the plot lacks all dynamics. There are no highs and lows, there are no funny moments, there is not even sex that is so abundant in both the books and the TV show, balancing the gore and horrors in both. At several points there is no logic behind what happens. There are only bad things happening to you in a steady flow, with no other options available than to sit and watch, apart from annoying quick-time events that you have to react to in order to keep the "fun" going. And, incredibly, at the end there is not even a resolution to the events of the season.

All in all, this series amounts to a stunningly bad gaming experience. I feel cheated and would like my money and 10 hours back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your choices don't matter - Have played through a few times choosing different paths(or so I thought) it ends up the exact same each time. It is somewhat fun to play with your partner if you're into the show, if you take turns, but yeah sadly no replayability, even though they make you think there is a lot of it... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Игрок не влияет никак на историю, все варианты ответов в диалогах приводят к одному и тому же, 90% всей игры утомительная тягомотина, клише на клише, мало того бедный игрок вытерпевший всю скуку, в финале СЕЗОНА (6 эпизодов) получит плевок в лицо в виде "продолжение следует". Такая игра достойна быть купленной разве что на мега распродаже за 2 бакса в одной корзинке с еще десятью такими же паршивыми играми. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you like rally (as much as I do) you won't be buying this piece of crap, where you drive the same stages with your goofy car horribly (bad physics) over and over again, until your head explode of anger and boredom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Di-a-boli-cal.

Slow, so slow it's unbelievable. Controls horrendous. Graphics pathetic.

This is my first SH game and I hate it. I have nearly finished chapter six and I have still only have two hours game play on the clock. Pointless useless notes left lying around to read. Oh thanks for telling things are fine now in that note. I don't know who you are or why stuff was bad before. I don't care.

I am sick to the back teeth or dying after a stupid combat with inadequate weapons or no ammo. Sick as hell of having to repeat it. On top of that it crashes everytime I minimise it, like when looking for a walkthrough. Basically 2.5 hours of nothing and 50% of that time repeating stuff. What the hell is that for over 1/3 of the game?

All I can say now is thank goodness I didn't pay £12 for a CD copy on ebay. The Steam copy is £18. For ages I kept thinking risk going for the ebay one. Anyway luckily a Steam copy arrived for £5.40 and I got that.

Days later and I tried to carry on a few times. still can't finish the chapter six boss. Wrangling with the controls to get him to axe the creature's arms is nearly impossible. By default it aims for the head. Then to aim you have to press shift. It is so hard to remember to cancel toggle shift after a strike. You get knocked down and get up to find you can hardly move because shift is still on. Smashed to the floor again. Maybe thirty goes at this boss. The end. I give up. Four days it has taken me to try finish chapter six. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The perfect example of how to ruin a franchise by selling the license to a bunch of amateurs.This game is wrong in so many levels. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?The only good thing about this PoS is the graphics and that's about it, everything else is absolutely flawed.Thanks for ruining one of my favorite franchises. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's spooky, I'll give it that, but not much more.    The game is buggy, and will frequently pause or lock up, requiring a restart.   The freeze and pause typically happen in combat, which throws off your coordination.   Your coordination is already way off, because the controls are laggy and imprecise, and in addition to inconvenient pausing, the game will sometimes randomly wrench control of the camera and your character away from you, right in the path of an enemy's attack.    It's like the developers (read sadistic -----) went out of their way to make the game as frustrating as they possibly could so they could claim it was "challenging."    If that wasn't bad enough, you've got a CONSOLE SAVE SYSTEM, with save spots fairly far apart.   Not only do you have to fight your way through almost an entire level after being killed by a level boss, but you've got non-interactive segments along the way that you can only *SOMETIMES* skip.  Sometimes, hitting escape will skip the in-engine cutscene.  Sometimes, all it does it jump you to the menu screen and pause the game -- ie. you have to sit through it for the billionth time.I loved SH1, SH2, SH3, I even thought The Room was ok.   I absolutely HATE this game.    It's a game designer's train wreck.    Hate this game.   It's a total waste of money.    The graphics are nice and slightly spooky, but there's no feeling of dread or goose bumps like with the first 3 games.   After all this time, I had expected the bugs to have been patched, but nope, this is the same steaming pile that was on shelves  last year.  I'm not even sure why I gave them a 2, other than that I can't bring myself to totally slag anyone's hard work (They'd get a 1 if the review system allowed for a zero). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I won't rant, too much, about how horrible this game is. It's not a REAL Silent Hill game, especially since it's made by different people. Sure, it may have Bubble Head Nurses, Robbie the Rabbit, and (dare I say it) Pyramid Head ("the Boogeyman" name makes him seem so lame... and they used MOVIE Pyramid Head!). What I'm getting at is, if I put Pyramid Head and Valtiel into Animal Crossing, it doesn't make it a Silent Hill game. Anyway, Silent Hill was never about fighting monsters. It was a psychological thing, and that was what made it scary. This game was not at all scary. I wish Team Silent would pick back up the series and show Konami how to really make Silent Hill games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was looking forward to this game being a Massive F1 fan and the stunning F1 games from Codemasters.

The graphics and cartoon effects on this game are great and very fun, but once you start playing, the fun pretty much stops, its one of the most frustrating games I have ever played and not fun at all!

Constantly you are taken out by opponents powers, and they are always faster than you, its very difficult to win, and if your car gets broken once or twice, you can kiss goodbye to winning the race, as usually the winner will win by about 20 - 30 seconds, while you spend most of the race looking for the pits driving around slowly.

The controls are horrific also, it feels like they did this game in a few weeks, and spent all the time on the graphics which as said, look very nice.

This is no where near as good as Mario Kart or Sonic & Sega racing, shall be trading this game in the weekend already, wouldn't even buy this game if it was in the bargin bin, is truly one of the worst racing games I've ever played and just so tedious, its not fun at all. Avoid and buy sonic and sega racing instead for a tenner or the new one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Deux points quand même pour la personnalisation très poussée du personnage, digne d'un vrai jeu de rôle. Le reste malheureusement, tout le reste est indigne d'un jeu de rôle. L'interface est horrible, le système de combat à la Final Fantasy mais en (encore) plus mauvais (si tant est que cela fût possible) est impinable. Musique insupportable, graphismes d'un autre âge (on dirait un jeu PS2 !!) et histoire d'une mièvrerie à faire bailler une chèvre. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If this is how bad real war can be...how disorganised and disobedient your troops can be...how lucky shots can end hours of travel & planning...how accurate people hiding in bushes "so thick they cant see the light of day" in can be...I hope im never drafted! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly I have tried to like this game, it's was meant to be a big moment for the vita but I just can't get into this. Controls feel slow and jerky, graphics are ok and frame rate is an issue. If you are a borderlands fan stick to the console. Some games just aren't meant to be handheld and this is sadly one of them 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My wife picked this up in the bargin bin for me. I played it for a few days but returned it. The good is that it has about the best off-season mode of any EA game to date. The bad is that you don't get to control the players and the graphics are on the level of Madden 95. So what's the point of having a football game if you can't play football? Back to the store it went. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game, that isn't worth the download in my opinion, very boring and repetitive. It doesn't have a storyline in my opinion. All I can say is try it if you got it for free, but don't if it will cost you 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've loved Silent Hill since the first one, and I started to see a decline in Origins but I still had faith in the series. I should have stopped, I found, when I bought Downpour. Pros: Voice acting seems to be better than the other Silent Hill games, I can actually tell Murphy is scared sh*tless. You can watch Murphy get more and more battered as he takes more damage. The UV light lights up hidden clues.You can (usually) block monster's attacks.While fighting a group of monsters, you don't lock onto a single one. You can switch between the group if one is about to hit you.Cons: The game is SO glitchy. Constant twitchy movements, and what's worse is the combat begins to glitch out worse as the game goes on. I'll go to attack a monster and my weapon goes right through the monster.The gameplay itself is just not fun in the least. I was constantly bored, and when I wasn't I was infuriated from the sheer frustration of not know what I'm supposed to do. Granted the other Silent Hills were similar in the fact that you had to really think to figure out a puzzle, but this gives you little-to-no clues whatsoever. The "mysteries" you pick up seem to have no relevance whatsoever to the game 90% of the time.I personally did not like all the side-quests you could do, I like Silent Hill to be a generally linear. You can only carry one weapon at a time. I guess it's supposed to add to the suspense? One gun, and one melee (or two guns if you care to try scouring the world for ammo)It's extremely gimicky, from balancing My BIGGEST problem with the game... You spend almost NO time in Otherworld. Out of the five hours of the game I played, I didn't even spend one hour in Otherworld.I was highly disappointed in the game, and regret ever spending the money for it. I caution anyone thinking of buying it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As said by others, this game is not deserving of its hype. Its game has horrible bugs and glitches that are so easy to find. The game has same very bad lags and full system lockups. It has terrible visual effects. (graphics are ok), the story is ok. The combat system is broken. Animations for using weapons make Murphy fly everywhere (as said by IGN as well), and sometimes in crowded areas the game slows down to an un enjoyable framerate per second. I agree with ccrogers15, he said it out right. This game never should of happened if this is how konami plans to lead on this once good series. This series WAS good, up until 4. After 4, we get games that are very unenjoyable. Book of memories is next, and oh god, im sure it will fail utterly. Konami, listen to your fans and PLEASE, develop silent hill 10 for us yourselfs. No more of this nonsence, or bring back the dev team who made Silent hill 1-4. Silent Hill 1-4 got all good reviews( silent hill 4 was lower), but the rest all got mixed reviews or completely panned (like origins). Come on konami. I took my copy back, and they gave me a refund at gamestop which is good. Im using the money for Silent Hill HD Collection, i suggest you should too, to avoid being disappointed by the worst silent hill ever made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Silent hill is coming to an end with downpour. Why cant konami just learn. We want true horror, not this crap. This is a horrible, boring game with several problems that make it literally unplayable. The game freezes randomly, lags constantly, the graphics glitch non stop, etc. Should i go on? SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUY RESIDENT EVIL OPERATION RACCOON CITY INSTEAD. This game is not true to the series, it is the same fail thats been going on since 4.This is it, i am done. No more silent hill for me. Was considering getting the new BOM for my vita, but after this crap, and noticing BOM was top down, im gonna pass instead. Too bad. Taking it for a refund today. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I seriously can not believe the scor this has gotten, this game is awefull. It has no atmosphere, none likeable caracters, not creepy at all, boring as **** and none silent hill feel. Silent hill is one of the greatest horror games ever and to see a travasty like this under it`s name is despicable, neve rplay this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely terrible. I expected it to be a 3D game like Pokemon X and Y, but it just turns out that you can't even catch Pokemon you would like without a handheld game. It sucks! Where's my Charizard? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love golf games..... I have been patiently waiting for the first 'next gen' golf game to blow me away, unfortunately the golf club isn't it. The game hasn't obviously been play tested before release , it's buggy the sound is awful and don't get me started on the visuals ....  jeez if this the best a developer can do then I am off to crack open my snes.  I am sure somewhere here there is a golf game but the shoddy mechanics, sound and visuals have ruined it. Shame on you HB studios , if I could get my money back I would , roll on pga tour next year , that's how it's done . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So when is EA going to do what they did with Fight Night Champion? As in drop in onto PSN and sell it in $5 increments. Because five bucks is about the total worth of this pile of scrap.BlackBox really dropped the ball on this one. A mere 2 hours will see you through the campaign, and that includes weirdly implemented QTE scenes. And after that, meh. Just meh.If you buy racing games you obviously like cars. My advice is to get into yours, drive to GameStop and trade in this junker. Or throw it at the cashier and run. Run! Who needs QTE's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Second worst NFS Series.
not much grip too much drift sequel of the NFS undercover. I bought this when it's came out but still sucks I don't know how to control car stability even now 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very Buggy Port of Crazy Taxi 1 & 2 for dreamcast, the worst version yet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As an avid f1 fan and a keen online sim racer, i was straight inline to get the 2014 f1 game. Wow. What a load of CRAP. Just my thoughts in no real order:
1. Its a complete copy and paste of the 2013 game, with a new skin over the car and a new engine noise.
2. There has been no improvement graphically between the games.
3. There has be no improvement of real simulation events (Pit stops for eg wind me up, no way to practice with your team to improve your personal pit stop times, and an average nearer to 4 seconds rather than the realistic sub 3 second stops.
4.DAMAGE This game you can drive into walls hit other players with little or no damage. Its so unrealistic. If a driver cuts across my wing i should loose an endplate atleast, but no. Tyre wear is no were near what it is in the 2014 season.
5. Team radio. Now i love team radio the concept makes the game more involving the team telling you whats going on in the race, but for eg, i was lapping same pace as alonso for about 20 laps, with a 2 second gap all those laps, then all of a sudden appartenltly im told im 3 seconds quicker per lap than the guy behind...? wtf. And also its tells you irevelivant info. if im battling in a championship for the lead, tell me in the race where my competitiers are. I won a season at the last race  bcos my competiter crashed out on lap 3 which i didnt know... grrr.
6. Get team performance relivant. If your gonna release a game sport related  this late on in the season, dont have the fudging lotus f1 cars winning races.... and where is mercedes / williams dominance.

I bought this game. 2 days of frustration and disapointment later i swapped it for horizon 2.
If you want a f1 game, get f1 2013 on the pc with all the realism and correct damage mods. Whhyyy stupid game developers when the infos and data is all there for you do you insist on continuing this scam towards f1 / racing gamers + fans. John. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's been a long, long time since I last played this. But I do remember one thing:

I hated it.

Granted, I will give it a little credit for trying to do something new, but what it does is still too rough around the edges. For a series with as large a fan base as Street Fighter, I was a bit shocked that they did this. I know that at the time 3D fighters were becoming more and more popular (with Virtua Fighter and Tekken leading in that regard) but Street Fighter was 2D and that is what makes Street Fighter, Street Fighter.

Overall:
I am just overly relieved that this was just a minor phase and that most future SF games went back to the 2D (or 2D-like) style. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

if you're looking for an aircraft simulator because you aspire to be a pilot (or you're already one and wanna practice the basics) by bunk-flying actual planes... don't download Microsoft Flight even if it's free. stick to FSX or even FS 2004.Microsoft Flight has absolutely nothing to do with simulation because they've messed up the angles in order to emphasize the game's graphics. one can't "scan" any instruments... there's just a GUI small enough to see the aircraft's heading, airspeed, altitude, power setting, fuel, and an annoying cross hair. there are no indications for vertical speed and turn coordination. there's also no point in having navigational instruments and flight planning since the game only takes place in Hawaii.as a game, it's not that impressive either. it only has the ICON A5 and the Boeing Stearman (if you have a Windows Live account) as default aircraft, the rest (which aren't that many) are DLC's in exchange for Microsoft points. i haven't tried this game with a joystick, but it does feel very awkward with an Xbox 360 controller especially during taxi. also, this game can be finished in a day because there aren't enough missions. flying freestyle is also boring with either of the default aircraft. the ICON A5 looks and feels like a car more than an aircraft while the Stearman is painfully simple.the only good thing about this game is the graphics. that's just about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really don't understand microsoft...  I think they would benefit providing PC Gamers, PC lovers, a game ahead if it's time.  Serioulsy I played Hawk 1 et 2 and the graphics was awesome.  The graphics in this game looks like 2007.  I think I'll just play Just Cause 2 and steal an arplane, it's seems more realistic than this...  Seriously Microsoft?!?!?!?!?!?!?If I put aside the lame graphics, the game is still a good sim, but when you want to feel like you are flying, and you know there is more out there, much, much more, you can't get over it...  I know I won't.  I played the demo and that's it.  I was waiting for this game...  DOH! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garbage! Their free-to-play content model does a poor job of masking the fact that this is a barely thought out and terribly executed excuse for a flight sim. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game originally had promise, however that quickly faded into obscurity.  The game had enormous potential, potential effectively pissed into the flusher by an incompetent development staff.  Graphically, the game is ok, not great, just ok.  The airplanes (the ones that are fully modeled) are nice, however the world you fly them in is stagnant and dead.  I won't even comment on the **** abominations that honestly have no place in gaming in the year 2012 (unless it's AI or a static display).  The game could succeed, however the developer needs to stop repeatedly shooting themselves in the foot.  More importantly, the game must find an identity, because really what is it?  An arcade shooter with no shooting?  A civilian flight game with an over abundance of warbirds? or a really poor attempt at a simulator?

As is, the game is little more than incomplete wasted potential. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If MS Flight is an indicator for what is to come for the games industry, then the future is bleak indeed. Flight takes a different approach to the previous games in the series; namely removing "simulator" from the name and giving us a small area to fly in, plus having customers pay money for additional aircraft or scenery; it's just that you're effectively paying £70 for about 1/100 of FSX or 2004. In Microsoft's rush to try and make the series more "accessible", all they've done is make a game too boring for the casual gamers and too insubstantial for older fans of the series. The only good thing I have to say about this game is that the graphics are quite nice, as is the sound. If I sound a bit dry, it's because everything about this game just makes me feel depressed for the AAA games industry and I really don't have anything to say about it, just don't download it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At first I was quite interested with the title, but after discovering the control system I was not happy. I don't think this type of game will ever be that interesting until the ability to fly is coupled with awesome scenic views. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has to be the biggest lie and letdown ever. I have never seen my money get pulled out of my pocket. I feel ashamed that this game (Wii port) even exists. I'd advise to stay away from this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Amazing DLC, but worst port ever. Game freezes every 30 minutes, collectibles won't get picked up due to a random glitch, ... Little to no effort put into this port. Buy it for PC, not for any console. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

got this free with ps4 monthly free games, i realise why its free, cos its worthless, it looks and plays like an old game from two generations ago, sure its fun if u dont care about graphics, and mediocre gameplay, but the cutscenes are half cg and half drawn as if they couldnt be bothered to finish it, but im glad cos i know its supposed to be fun and silly but the story is something a 2 year old could write, get GTA, any GTA you will have a far better time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are decent for VR but the things in the distance are limited by the tech which makes them blurry and limits its "graphic" rating for me. As some people have already mentioned, it truly makes you feel like they built this game for a toddler. The puzzles are trivial yet at the same time some of the tasks are painstaking due to almost no guidance, you will be constantly saying what the hell am I supposed to do or where am I supposed to go. I believe the movement is by far the worst part. Moving forward is unbelievably slow, I'd compare it to being in crouch mode for other games and this makes travel horribly tedious. Turning your body is insanely fast compared to moving forward which is one of the reasons I believe is the cause of most of the motion sickness issues and there is no way to adjust the speed.  This game is quite high up there on the nausea scale. I haven't had any problem with any other game and that could be because most are in fixed position but this one was horrible on my stomach. Even if you have no nausea issues with this game, it still doesn't deserve a high score because it is just too boring. I truly hope this is not what we can expect the typical game for VR to be or it is surely dead before it has even had a chance to begin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First FPS in years, maybe a decade, that didn't have a "down the sights" mode when using a gun. You basically aim from the hip, with a tiny crosshair in the center of the screen. Fighting regular Aliens isn't a problem, but try shooting those facehuggers without a zoom function. Add to that poor lighting, and you end up wasting a clip killing one facehugger. Then there is the combat droids, that can one-shot kill you from like 30 feet away with a shotgun. Try shooting off their heads without decent gun controls. Alien moved like it was drunk/drugged. Predator didn't get much time, as I traded this in as quickly as possible, so no idea on how he plays. Rogue Warrior may be bad, but at least it makes me laugh while I play, so thats some sort of enjoyment. This has none. I give it a 2 as it has color/sound and didn't crash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game. Too many other great games to spend money on. Unpolished design and balance 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game would've been better if they didn't try so hard to make it such a "different" game from everything that's already out right now. The complicated controls, and the lighting is just horrible, I wish i could have actually enjoyed this game. If you want a good shooter with mediocre online play your better off getting Bioshock 2 or even Modern Warfare 2 because this game has absolutely NO replay value.

Must be the stupidest single player campaign ever. The atmosphere with marine is gone (stupid chick keeps talking in my ear), aliens are like little old men walking on wheelchairs and take forever to get to me. The predator campaign starts ok but as soon as it beacomes a tomb raider it gets stupid also. The alien campaign would be decent if you actually felt like an alien and not a robot with hud display ans markers everywhere. The hud is justified only for predators and marines with high technology. Anyway, biggest dissapointment of the year, maybe the miultiplayer will save it but...

There has never been a gaming series so schizophrenic as the Gothic series. It started strong with a solid first two games, trailed off to rubbish for the third, now we have this mess. There is no excuse to release a game on XBOX 360 that runs so poorly that just getting around in the world is a chore. I swear that the frame rate is mostly around 15-18fps and it ruins any chance the game has at being entertaining right out of the gate. There are so many other RPGs to play on 360 that do everything better - so why anyone would bother with this mess is beyond me

Voilà une daube qui cache bien son jeu, car en effet le doublage français est de fort belle facture, la musique correcte (le thème du menu est très réussi contre toute attente) et la jouabilité à la manette fort bien pensée également. En outre, le système de combat à base de roulades et de magie n'a rien d'original mais se laisse jouer sans peine.

La réalisation est hélas atroce. Arcania est laid, parfois hideux même (les personnages mon dieu !) et se permet de ramer fortement et cela sans arrêt, à toute heure du jour ou de la nuit (les transitions météo sont trop brutales d'ailleurs). En vérité c'est un supplice constant (c'est programmé avec des moufles).

Le personnage imposé a le charisme d'une baignoire et l'histoire a l'intérêt d'un épisode de Derrick. Dans ce triste monde générique les innombrables quêtes dignes d'un MMO de Prisunic (va chercher, rapporte, bon chien) n'arrangent rien, on souffle et on souffre d'ennui assez rapidement. Las, on désinstalle, on éjecte et on balance.

This game appealed to me in various ways. I am a huge fan of the post-apocalyptic theme and competitive shooters. The map environments are well detailed and are interesting to explore. However, this game just feels awful. The controls and gunplay are extremely awkward. Besides the fact that the game just feels wrong, there is also absolutely NO playerbase to mention. At any given time I can log in and fine anywhere from 1-15 people playing. Also, the START match button on the menu has been broken for months and the developers have done nothing except tell you to use the browse feature instead. This game also frequently crashes on me.
Overall, this game really has no unique or interesting value to it. It is a very weak developed shooter with lots of broken features and no playerbase.
If the developers of Ravaged could at least take the time to fix a major bug present at the main menu, maybe I wouldn't rate the game as low as I am. But as of right now, Ravaged is by far one of the worst games I have purchased, ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to say, before you read on, I played only for 28 minutes. If this is an issue for you, ignore it, but I promise I have a really good reasons for it.

To start off with, this weekend was a free weekend for the game, so I fortunately didn't have to purchase the game. This game is just bad. It's one of those fun bads, but still bad. To start off with, the graphics aren't THAT great. I have my settings on High, and even then the textures look questionable. Graphics aren't everything, and they aren't straight out horrid, but not that good.

For gameplay? Oh god no. First off one of the major things I thought this game was about was the vehicles. Turns out, they're terrible. They drive absolutely horrible and defy physics sometimes. The sounds produced by the vehicles are alright, but just end up producing an annoying buzz after so long. The weapons are just silly. Most of the time the recoil either is absent totally, or is so large isn't not even funny. It's also funny how when you ADS, there is next to no recoil, while in third person mode, it's very large. The weapons aren't balanced either, as the M4 kills super fast, the snipers are trash (literally, they don't even work), and the pistols are just as good as any pistol in any game. Maps are alright. They got lazy at some points, when you go to a stair you just magically teleport to the top of them, you can get stuck in many parts.. it's just horribly put together.

Again, 28 minutes, not that long, but I just couldn't take it after using my M4 to blast my way to their spawn and camp them while my team just gathers gas cans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a huge worms fan and was very disappointed with Team 17's turnout here. First and foremost, the camera controls are TERRIBLE. It's nearly impossible to consistently get the camera to pan across the screen. Those good old days of just move your mouse to change the camera view were tossed out of the window when they made this game. I have no clue how this game passed QC or any usability testing. The other huge downside is that there are so few weapons in the game, it gets boring. the whole fun of worms is wondering what's gonna pop out of that crate, a crazy old lady, a mad cow, an iron donkey?? No clue why the limited the game to about 25 weapons. Finally, the other annoyance i s that you have to play a rather boring story-mode to unlock the mini-games and other sound banks. This is just a pet peeve of mine, but if I shelled out the $50 for the game, I shouldn't have to complete boring, pointless challenges to unlock content that I paid for. One other major drawback - no online game play. Honestly, looking back on this... I have no idea why I bought this game. I'll most likely post it to ebay this weekend and see if I can get some of my $$ back. Overall, I'd say save your money and buy a different game. If you must have worms, I heard there's an XBOX live version of Worms 3d for $10 instead of the $50 they charge for this game.

This is not a true Metroid game. So much so that it's hard to not think of it as a declaration of creative bankruptcy. Chibi characters in a series that's known for it's haunting, eerie atmosphere. Random space marines in a series known for it's strong protagonist. Nintendo truly has fallen from grace... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It barely has anything to do with metroid besides a few times they mention samus, why did they even call this metroid prime? Why didn't they call it "don't buy this game, it's **** federation force" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not much of an RPG... Dusnt make much difference which starting character you use except for a change in difficulty, and if different villains used different tactics in battle there would have been some nicer variety, but it's basically just a hack and slash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It goes between the RPGs but it all looks different. The 1950's sci-fi influence is almost totally gone. Thumbs way down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Below average game. Set in a world which it has absolutely misrepresented in every way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible terrible game. Thank god Bethesda took over and made things right.
Game has terrible graphics
Terrible gameplay
Too linear
Boring
No free roaming
Not even a real Fallout game
Just a few piles of  thrown together just to make a bigger pile of 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

**** ass game. I preordered it too and oh man it's one of the few times I have ever regretted preordering a game. Save yourself the 5 bucks it's worth now and dont buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

More a trial in patience than a new setting, Honest Hearts has one sort of good quality: A mildly interesting side story inside the caves sprinkled throughout the map. Besides this, it has a boring and predictable plot, way more walking than anything has a right to force me to do, no landmarks besides canyon walls, and characters with yawn-inducingly unoriginal personalities and goals.

It looks pretty though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well actually I started with MOO3 to play MOOx, Well and I guess it will be my last. I wanted to learn how to play but there is no tutorial and help is SOOO much txt. Actually I think I will not play it second time... I better play PAX EMPIRE - game is older for 5 years but gameplay is... better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This "game" is a great crap. MOO 1 is much better than this. What a pity of 20? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just not fun. The interface is unimaginably complex, and while you start off fairly well, understanding most of it, you'll soon be utterly lost, trying to remember to give a hundred different commands before you hit the next turn button. And the manual is glaringly flawed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has the absolute WORST UI I've ever seen -- EVER. You won't be able to see chat unless you stop doing whatever you're doing and hit ENTER -- good luck trying to communicate with people in the heat of battle. Supposed to have a voice chat system built in, but neither my husband nor I were ever able to get it to work. You'll probably have better luck using Ventrilo or Teamspeak.

Gameplay is incredibly repetitive. Do a mission. Turn it in. Go do an arkfall. Now go do a siege. Do another mission. Rinse. Repeat. And since there are only about 3 or 4 mob models in the entire game, it gets very old very fast. Seriously. You shoot the same stuff from level 1 to level 1000+.

There are 4 player archetypes to choose from, but they ALL do the same thing. The only way to really be viable is to pack as much DPS as possible. There is NO support for alternative play-styles.

My advise? Don't bother. Go play Warframe it's so much more fun and has way more variety. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do you like buying a mediocre, under-developed game, then buying endless DLC to fill it in?  Then Defiance is the game for you!  Defiance is the best DLC purchasing simulator on the market.  Marvel at the countless DLC pack, as you pay, and pay, and pay again, just to get the game you thought you were getting at launch!  Nobody does DLC purchase simulation games like this company!  Its almost like you're really spending endless money on endless DLC.  Very realistic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being in constant pain, I enjoy engaging distractions.
I enjoyed Sniper's Ridge, with my sniper!  But, in recent weeks (01 of 2015) the left click used for scope doesn't stay engaged.  This problem makes the target flip in n out of sight.  Trying to get a fix on this flaw appears impossible as I can't enquire for help from support. Clicking on their links gives me address doesn't exist.
This has gone on for weeks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While a few new concepts have been added to the gaming world, this game is not much to look at if one looks past the few shallow reviews left here by passersby. Let's start from the beginning, as i played rift before this game, and thoroughly enjoyed it's concepts and content, i expected something above average for this game, but that is not what i received upon being invited to the Alpha. Yet, then i went one to try to help with solving bugs and giving suggestions content wise, and that all went unanswered due to lack of fixes or simple neglect of the Alpha community, which made apparent that the dev has really given up or simply put down the project, and for this reason, i believe the game has no real value in terms of maturing over time, as the crew seems to have a different agenda then that of rift. It also seemed to be a rushed product, due to it's lack graphic wise and content wise, as the voice acting seemed so rushed and placed that it literally sounds if they almost didn't even do it in studio, and that's not even the worst audio, as the charger was changed multiple times due to the quality of recordings they received from dodge, which also shows how much they were willing to give up to their preteen associated sponsors such as axe and etc.
All this and i haven't even touched on the combat yet. As i said before, the game seemed rushed, and content wise shows so. The end game is non-existent, along with a viable progression system. Oh yes, i just remembered that, the progression system is linear, so no matter what level your weapon is, or what rarity (e.g. a green/uncommon, will be exactly the same as an orange/legendary, except for one little bonus effect that might or might not be what you need/want) they will be almost exactly the same, this amplified by the gimmicky perk tree that was constantly debuffed due to complaints of extremely unbalanced and unviable pvp that was dominated by rocket launching bunny hoppers (is still plagued by this if you must know), and is now so shallow that you feel as if you wasted that 10 hours getting +50 ego rating from some ridiculous broken "achievement" (which they call pursuits) that gave you them because you already ran so many congruent/exactly the same arkfalls that became so tedious you just had to force yourself to do something different. Also, if you want to say the arkfalls are akin to the rift system in rift, then your completely wrong. This "exciting" and "replayable" system has so little variance that, in alpha, people just plain stopped doing them, due to both their tediousness, and their lack of a legitimate award. Also, on a side note, if your hoping for an expansive vehicle system, their are only 7 variants of vehicles aside from colors, of which none are customizable at the least.
Oh, and to further make this mess worse, the reason they don't give legitimate rewards to you is so that they can make you pay for that weapon you desperately want. For example, to even be able to get a legendary/orange weapon  (extremely low chance that makes me want to cry due to their linear progression) you need to get a t4 lockbox that will cost 64 arkfall keys, and you will most likely only make 4 from a major, that will likely take anywhere from 15-45 minutes depending on how many people know what they are doing. This results in you needing to grind these arkfalls for around 8 hours to even get one, they will probably not even have what you want. So by using this 8 hour grind time obstacle, they made it possible to simply by them with your real hard earned money. Oh, and if you want one of the actually good looking outfits, you probably going to have to pay 10 dollars for that too, because you can't even earn them in game.
And to top all this off, they have had months to fix that unintuitive UI they try to push on their PC gamers that resulted when they were too damn lazy to change it from the console counterparts of this game. In fact, the entire alpha gave up on the topic due to their lack of communication regarding the issue. Such issues were brought up several times, but always ignored, like most of the bugs.
So all in all, i just wanted to save you from this worthless game that has reduced my respect for Trion Worlds 10 fold by telling how this rushed mess is lacking in every aspect, and that you should look farther than that fluff those positive reviews give you and see the cold hard truth about this game before you waste that coveted 60 dollars of yours. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This mediocre FPS MMO is littered with glaring flaws and distractions from really integrating the social aspect of the game.  The gear/looting and menus options just feel dated and clunky.  Top that off with dull environments and super predictable AI and you have a game worth half it's current retail price at best.  IMO wait for the price cut or steam deal before you blow money on this... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is unpolished, buggy, gameplay is fun at times, but unimaginative.  None of this kills the game.  That is done by the repetition and a system that doesn't keep you wanting to flesh our your character.  After 20 hours, you will have done anything there is to do in this world multiple times.  That is pretty normal for an MMO, where defiance differs is its Loot/leveling system, which is veryshallow and I'm hesitant to say it even has one.  You can easily get to the end of the game with the same guns you had at the beginning, this is because the stats on a higher level weapon is exactly the same as that of a lower level weapon.  In the end, you may be tempted like I was.  I bought this game and wanted to love it.  I have 20 hours logged(for many gamers 20 hours for a game like this is a laughable amount), before I saw this game for what it is, a rushed, shoddily put together money grab exploiting the first game of its kind.    Save your money for now and wait it out, by the time the price goes down, maybe it will be a game of comparable quality to some other games out right now.  As is, even if it were free, you could do better.  To Trion and Syfy, you could of had a contender, instead its just a bum, which is what it is... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoy Borderlands 2 Co-op, and think that you might also enjoy a less polished, buggy version of the same, then you "might" enjoy Defiance.

If you enjoy traditional MMOs, in any capacity, then quickly hide your wallet before Trion smells your money.

What I like about the game:
The shooting.  Surprisingly the combat is actually pretty good.  There is a decent variety of weapons, and I haven't noticed any bugs involving poor bullet pathing or anything like that.
Rocket-boosting your vehicle over hills and watching yourself fly knowing there will be no damage or penalty in any way.
Missile Launchers.  I felt this one needed it's own good point; not sure why.
Everyone gets their own loot and xp is given to anyone who participates in killing an NPC.

The things I disliked/hated (get comfortable because this list is quite daunting):
This is not an MMO.  This is a Co-op that is awkwardly placed into a persistent world.  In fact, I would say that the only aspect of this game that is utilized by an open-world environment is the driving, and even that doesn't NEED the persistent world and might even have benefited from an instanced, scripted event.
The driving uses the god-aweful controls of A and D to turn instead of the mouse, and there is no way to change it.  Needless to say, this is completely archaic and no one enjoys driving with keystrokes.  To be clear, Borderlands driving  Good.  Defiance driving  Clunky and unrealistic.
The game is marketed by offering players the chance to get their hands on alien technology!  Exciting!  But wait.. you get that technology almost immediately in the game, and it is WORSE than the standard realism weaponry that you get in any other shooter.  One weapon simply fills the gap of the fantasy "healing gun", while the other is decent in itself, but fails on the basis of being of limited use.  Short answer, you will find yourself using standard Earth technology unless you insist on gimping yourself with their alien technology (this of course does not include the "alien" elemental versions of standard weapons).
There are no "dungeons" or really any reason to ever invite someone to a group.
The massive events that pop up are a faceroll.  It is all very, very easy.
The perk system gives off the impression of "uber customization" but in actuality there is very little true options.  By selecting one core ability, it cuts off around half of the perks as viable options for your build (since they directly affect another core ability).  Looking at the perks, it is very easy to see several possible "builds" in which you venture toward, but a lot of these builds are not actually viable in-game.. Most notably the Melee Build, in which you do very low damage and get eaten alive by pretty much every NPC you encounter, and the Medic Build in which you almost never find someone to revive because the game's difficulty is a joke.
Lastly, I want to mention the game's use of character speech.  Quite a lot of characters talk to you during the game, whether it be during a cut scene or yelling at you as you are doing a nearby mission.. but the one glaring problem is that your character NEVER.. EVER.. SPEAKS.. EVER!  He (or she) just stands there like a mute idiot while other people have engaging conversations AT him (or her).  (s)He doesn't even change facial expressions or anything.  It is as though your character is completely unaware that other people are in the room, let alone talking directly to him.

TL;DR  If you want to spend $60 on something that truthfully should be F2P, then you are in the right place.  For everyone else, keep waiting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story is poorly written, voice acting is average, and most importantly (because I can forgive the first two things) the gameplay just sucks.  If Planetside 2 was really bad and had PvE, it'd be this game.  Unless you just hate PvP, don't play this game, go pick up Planetside 2 for free and jump into some great shooting.  I suppose the PvE isn't horribly implemented, it's just so repetitive that I couldn't play it for more than six hours total over three days.  Haven't logged in since.  If you're like me and think you might give this game a shot, bear in mind that you can't get a refund on Steam and there are better online shooter experiences out there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garbage, wish i had my money and time back.  I can't help but question if all the positive user reviews that came out immediately at release, which were notably done by mostly people with no other reviews, were paid for by Trion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A friend of mine hyped the game alot for me, so I decided to buy the game (which I did, at launch).

First, the patcher is horrible. You have to download 15 GB straight. If you close the patcher and opens it again, you have to redownload the whole game again  and it does not delete what you already downloaded.

Second, theres no real progression in the game. It is a online shooter, and the RPG elements are limited to allmost none.

It would probably have received a better score if they have called it a MMOTPS instead of a MMORPG. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do not get fooled by flashy and amazing videos of this mmorpg...
1st of all, there is a lot of what you can see in those videos, that never been implemented in the game.
Crazy vehicles, interactive weather system, thousands of weapons etc, you wont find in Defiance.
Also the game itself was supposed to be revolutionary, with a lot of players interactions between the TV series on SyFy channel and the actual game... It is NOT.

Defiance is a simple online shooter with a storyline... Although a storyline so short (2 weeks of gameplay) and a map so small, that i found myself having nothing to do after only 2 or 3 weeks of gameplay. Once you're done with the storyline, you will be doing a series of highly repetitive side missions, with the same voice over, again and again, which can be done in no time as well.
And then it is pvp time for you, or you'll find Defiance quite boring, and really fast.

For 60$ (Now 39$ since the reviews were terrible) i would have give a good average score if the game itself would have been around 20$ at launch, which would have been a fair price for such a small game.
But unfortunately, Defiance has been one of the major let down for me, since Aliens Colonial Marines.

The combat music is monotone, and on a perpetual loop...
smallest map ever on any mmorpgs i've played so far.
Ridiculous weapon system, with no real impact on any stats whatsoever.
Repetitive boring side missions
Shortest main storyline ever created.
3 kinds of vehicles, with no weapons mounted on them whatsoever.
No weather system, boring "Rift like" arkfalls, No big rewards, and lame Achievement system.
Almost non-existent in game store, selling armours you can get in game for free...just different colours.
NO economy whatsoever, No auction system, no brokers, no crafting.
No real goals, no immersion, no feelings or attachment to the main characters.
No real interactive tie to the TV series, unless some minimal impacts.

The only thing this game has, is good graphics, visuals, effects and cosmetics.
But even with that, as a shooter 1st, the mmorpgs element aren't there at all.
Its a good little shooter game you'll want to try once it'll go down 20$ or 14$.

So wait until it comes down as for the price. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not mind massive multiplayers. However the idea of the game was what convinced me to buy it. With the exception if some not bad graphics I am not at all impressed with the game. The graphics could be better. What they show you in the loading screen is obviously not what you get in game. The amount of space it takes to actually play the game (which must be from your hard drive) doesn't justify the waiting time. This being said I do not enjoy having to wait 6 to 10 minutes to play an average game. The view of your character is inadequate, as she is tiny (and I've a very large tv).

As I said the idea of the game is cool. However the content and waiting time per each session is lost on me. And the content is just not worth the wait. I'll enjoy the show more i hope.

As a foot note server que times for a game I spent 70$ to buy is not acceptable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Defiance is an average, painfully repetitive game, but it is oddly addictive.

The game is very bare bones, there are only a handful of missions and they are repeated throughout the game. The weapons rarely feel unique, you get your RPG's, AR's, pistols, sniper rifles and so on, but most feel weak and you'll stick to one or two through most of the game.

The missions themselves are very dull, go here, kill all the enemies, activate an object and kill more enemies. The story is pretty bland with main characters that are cliche and boring. The fact that your character doesn't have the ability to speak or even show emotion during the cutscenes leaves little reason to watch them. At first they're a nice break from the constant shooting, but I quickly found myself skipping them as they were just boring, poorly animated scenes of NPC's standing around talking about why I need to go to a location and kill some more.

The Arkfall's are pretty interesting, they don't really bring anything new to the game, but stick with them and a large enough group of players will arrive making for some chaotic fun. The vehicle controls are poor, the vehicles feel like they're made of cardboard and using the W,A,S and D keys to control them doesn't help.

The whole MMO thing doesn't really work for this game, at least on the PC. I've never grouped up with people or needed help on a mission, and I rarely see anyone speak as the chat interface is awful and most people either ignore or don't realise it's there.

Overall the game has some fun to be had, but it's not worth the asking price. Wait for a large price drop first. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

people, as much as i love the wii for mario and zelda games its just not the console for fps. you go to xbox or ps for that, just look at the cod ports, they just dont compare. do what i do, i own a xbox mainly for shooters and use my wii for platformers and adventure games, simple as that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A generic platformer that lacks any immersion and does nothing to showcase the possibilities of VR. Why would Oculus choose this of all things to bundle with the Rift, or to make Rift-exclusive? You could get the same experience using anaglyph 3D glasses. The mind, it boggles.

As a platformer it's a decent if forgettable experience. As a launch title, it's utter garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game's online play is a mess. I want my $30 back. Online play is so buggy that you'll probably only get through an entire game without it freezing about 40% of the time. EA keeps the disappointments rolling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is just worthless.. The driving experience is quite good, but the damages are really unreallistic. I have never seen a F1 miss a turn and crash into a wall at 120 mph go without any damages. I really miss the first F1 game in the previous gen (PS3). No career, which is in my opinion the only reason to play any sport game. Really, really disapointed 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll make this short and sweet:  Alpha Protocol "might" have been well-intentioned BUT caveat emptor  BUYER BEWARE!  This "game" is supposed to be an RPG with action-elements but after having repeated freezing, weird graphical anomalies, poor collision, extremely unbalanced BOSS fights, and just plain ol' sh#t-on-a-stick gameplay, Alpha Protocol trudges very close to "shovelware" and "coaster-of-the-decade territory. . . .   -Tried playing this on both systems and encountered bugs aplenty.  And, after nearly one year since its launch, there has not been (for this PS3 version at any rate)  any patches nor is there any DLC to make it more playable.   The devs at OBSIDIAN have suggested, in a recent interview following the launch of their latest opus Dungeon Siege III, that they'd LIKE to make a sequel to Alpha Protocol. . .    Hope not.  That would mean we'd, likely, have two versions of Alpha Protocol to toss in the garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WOW is this game a broken piece of crap!!! awful story,broken gameplay and poor graphics keep this disaster on the worst games ever list.bugs bugs bugs everywhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sad,because I bought this game thinking it would be great,but it's not.The levels are too easy.The look is awful,the first one in snes is amazing!!this one is a bad,really bad game.40 euro spent in a game that it does not deserve it.A waste of money :(
Since December last year,3ds has not any good game,3 months of nothing at all,and the future looks bad,only Smash looks good.I'm start to think in buying another handheld :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've barely played it (only played 4 levels) as I can't stand how it looks. I realize it's supposed to be a "Story effect" like on Yoshi's Story... but bleh!!! It just looks awful!!! I'd rather play the SNES version of this game than put any more effort into this one... This is the only Mario Game that I'm never going to complete unless Nintendo decide to release more junk like this! Also it's too easy!!! it's a mockery to the original game! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of Yoshi's Island games and this one wasn't fun. Its honestly the worst Yoshi's Island you will see out there. I really disliked the world, music, and overworld. Everytime I beat a level, it felt like a chore. Yes I beat the game and it felt like I was watching Les Mis (3 Years). I don't see a reason to replay this game because it is worse than New Super Mario Bros 2. This is not a MUST BUY for anyone. The only good thing it has is controlling the vehicles. Thats fun but its not in many levels at all. Do not pay full price for this game because it is only worth $5.

Yoshi's New Island gets a 2/10 :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this new edition of Painkiller -- really I did, but it is not the same old fun. Twitchy, weak levels to play, too easy, then too hard. It is like a sloppy mod. I have read it is not even the same production team. Save money on this one folks - go buy the original! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is impossible. And the drag races SUCK. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i would rate this game higher but it keeps freezing up on me in tournaments. i have gone through 2 games so far hoping that the first game i bought just had a defect but the second one i bought did the same thing. i get down to about 40 people out of 250 and thats when it happens. it takes a long time to get there too. other than that this game is pretty cool. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just jumping into the mix. At first I thought the freezing was just a random fluke. But, after 5 straight times of having it freeeze at the 4th or 5th round of blinds of the same 200 person tournament, I knew it had to be a programming flaw. This game is now an expensive paperweight. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked the game, then it started locking up on me. You spend the time and play hard just to get to the final table and it freezes. I hoped I was waiting for someone from another table to show up..... apparently not. At least I am not the only one who has had this problem. It takes all of the desire to play this game away.

This game dosn't deserve to be in the Lord of the Realms series, it sucks. Go back and play LOTR II its at least a hundred times as good. You win battles or lose them with little difference, your enemy just as yourself just drags in a new serf and give you the ole rope a dope. You have to take out several regions simultaneously to have any real effect. But why bother your attention can only be on one thing at a time, so there is no way to enjoy the random victory you will sometimes 'enjoy'. After a about 10 time trying the game I have decided to toss it, the times I won were at dissapointing as the losses, it just plain sucks!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game actually sucks! And I was waiting for it for so long... I am very disappointed. :( I was very big fan of LOTR2. When I started to play third part I was expecting something like LOTR2 but with 3D, but instead of that I get... I dont know how to call it... childish strategy, why childish? because it is SO simple - there is no need to get into battle yourself, computer will do it just fine, so all you have to do is to manage your land - that is just choose what kind of man will be your vassal (knight,serf,priest or burgher). If you liked second part of game or if ya liked Stronghold then dont buy this game - you will not like it, actually I dont know who would like this game and why? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't want to repeat all other users opinions, but this game is crap compared to LOTR2, and crap compared to other today titles too. Building own castles is a great innovation, but it means nothing when whole game is a mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slow moving and poorly planned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wasn't at all what i expected. I did enjoy the seiges, but he battlefield is useless to command yourself as stratedgy is taken out of it. Also could't figure out how to train troops other then mercenaries. They have ruined a great series in my books. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a huge what the heck? If i put on an older game, and compared it to the orginal of Spyhon Filter 1,2, and 3, u could hardly tell the difference. The whole scenery in this game, no matter what level, is choppy and more like a playsation game. But, u will not be able to tell that much. The game was mainly overshadowed by darkness, terrible controls, as well as terrible scenery, even overshadow a lackluster preformance. Also, I maybe or not maybe be a soldier in a war, but i do know that when someone was killed, their body does not look like that of someone who is prefectly fine. This mainly applies for when a "main" character is killed. Syphon Filter The Omega Strain does not fell a "new" Syphon Filter" game. It feels more like an expansion pack. In this game, u take command of an agent for Gabe Logan and numerous other people. The heroes of the older games are now retired in a past sense, even though they do not look as if they have aged at all. However, terrible controls worse an already lackluster performance for Syphon Filter. The sound were highpoint of the game, but its far from perfect. It was extremely hard to hear what the mission is supposed to be because the characters speak to quiet unless the volume on your televison is at 70%. u will have trouble trying to get backgrond information on your duties. i remember when Syphon First came out on the playstation. That great game leads many to believe that it could have been as great as Metal Gear Solid was. Syphon Filter could have accompolished that task of somebody didn't get lazy when they designed this game. If u are resurrect a series form the dead, make sure that u dont ruin the series completely . Stay away from the game and play the original Syphon Filters on the ps1, because that is the memory you should have of a great series, not this terrible memory that this game has given me. So dont let it tempt to u.

Who ever gives this game a score above 5 is a fool, and here's why;Capcom doesn't care about the gamer, they care about their pocket book. The mercinaries is a mini game that has been (and this is rare for capcom) free in their most recent releases of resident evil or biohazard as it's known in japan.My complaint plain and simple is that it's a $45, 300mb on a card that can hold up to and excess of 50gb of data, and get this; Resident Evil revelations, their next full release coming up in a few months for the 3DS is only to be roughly 1.3gb in size, so why not just put this mini game on their? Here's what you have been fooled into believing; (1)"its a bench mark test" -no it's not, capcom begins distribution of their games one year after they're done being made (2) "the idea of having this nice mini game in your pocket is so nice" - again, why not just put it on the already finished full game coming out for the 3DS in a few months (3) "it was made for the fans, you wouldn't understand" - i just want to punch youSo anyways, heres the answer to the they released it on a seperate card; to make more money. "well Matthew" you say, "isn't that the whole objective of a business, to make money?" well technically yes Mr. useless, mindless 'video gamer' fool, it is! Except the difference is that usually you don't want to willingly get ripped off by an openly admitted company attempting to be a monopoly.So what's my verdict? I am definitely going to but RE Revelations coming out soon, but under no condition am I going to buy their $45 mini game that should be already be on the fully released game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrendous! Considering the game was based on (arguably the best online shooter ever) COD4 it leaves so much to be desired. So much so, that after only 3 hours gameplay (having completed the game on its hardest setting first time around in that time) I am willing to trade it in or sell the game to anyone willing to waste £30 on it let alone £40! If you liked COD4 steer clear this game is no where near it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

*Sigh* I don't know how they screwed this game up. It had so much going for it. This game had so much potential.

Plot: The plot in this game is bull **** if you played the previous games. It's still bull **** if you haven't. I won't spoil anything, if you wanted that you could look it up.

Gameplay: Holy crap, this game did so much right, but had terrible level design that made all of the good things not matter. It gave zero an (almost) entirely new set of move he can learn instead of just copying moves from X4. The weapons for X are unique and useful. Zero's buster has been improved making him more effective at ranged combat and X gets a z-saber slash which can be useful, but most of the time your just better of spamming projectiles. The level design is that bad. Despite all these good things, the level design is just crazy. I really wonder what they were thinking designing certain levels.

Controls: They're a bit more clunky then previous installments, but they work.

Conclusion: I can see why some people enjoy this game, (As I mentioned, there are good things about it.) but is it a game worth paying money for to see if you like? Heck no! If your truly curious, get the megaman X collection pack for gamecube or PS2. It includes megaman X 1-6, and an unlock able megaman racing game that was never released in the US. It's actually pretty fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mega Man X WAS good until this abomination came out. Everything is clunky and the story is terrible. This game sucks and the levels are an abomination as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was by far the worst dlc for fallout 3. Many compare it to bethesdas first dlc Operation anchorage which was a major disappointment. But although that one was short it was a lot of fun and you came out with great equipment. Like Operation anchorage Mothership zeta is based on Fallout 3s combat. Unlike Operation anchorage mothership zeta is just plain old boring. Once completed theres no reason to replay. It gets boring real quickly. The most interesting highlight was the space walk and an interesting death ray battle. The new characters are interesting. Being able to meet a pre war soldier and a cowboy from way before the great war was amazing. Until you realize that all they have to say is I can't believe they did that to the world. The new equipment is bland. There is nothing original in the alien designs. Its different from fallout and is cool to look at for a shortwhile. Buts its like any old alien movie, little green guys speaking in jibberish with bug eyes. This is the worst dlc of all five. The fact that this is the last is the worst way bethesda can leave us. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This DLC sends one of my favorite games out on a bad note. Linear pacing, almost no Karma alteration (killing the unarmed xenocidal maniacs in the ship nets negative karma, and that's about it), and an almost complete lack of story put it on par with Operation: Anchorage. Unlike O:A, though, there's no game-altering loot like the Stealth Armor or Winterized T-51b Power Armor. Sure, there's a bunch of nice energy weapons, but none of them markedly better than what exists in the core game. In the end, I find myself hoarding the Alien Epoxy found on the ship (which can repair any weapon on its own) and ignoring the rest of the DLC. After completion, one has the option of returning to the mothership; I find myself wondering why to go there in the first place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Godfather 3 of DLCs. Doesn't make much sense and doesn't advance the Fallout narrative whatsoever.
I'm playing it through this second time now purely for the achievements.
Play it once if you're a completionist, but never again.
The worst of what the Fallout series has to offer.
Playable, though just barely, and easily forgettable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You'll start playing the tutorials and slowly you'll realise that you're dying with every minute. You'll finish the field for tutorial 1 after what feels like an eternity. Then you'll look at the list of tutorials and see that tutorial 10 is "plant potatoes". Oh good god this can sod the hell off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad. It's very very bad. I'm not comparing it to big consoles versions and downgraded to floor-level graphics is not worst part, but re:r on 3ds was much better than this though it was much weaker console. Worst part is optimisation. When you got severally hit it becomes complitly unplayable. Controls freezing like hell and it looks more like punishment for buying it not game and fun. Because of graphics level it completely impossible to see pale red clouds of monsters and even worse with those invisible mothefu...monsters.
I regret for wasting my money on this. It's got two patches already and they weight is half of game each and after those there no improvment of game quality at all. Programmers weren't even trying do something worth, they just downgraded and cut of all stuff that vita have no power to vield.
It's not optimised, bad looking, hard to control and it's my worst vita experience of all time. Don't even think to buy it.
Ps and i'm not talking about gamedesign where you must replay all levels for two times 'cause developers are lazy bastards and they don't care about game itself - just profit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The control methods used in this version of the game for Wii render it totally unplayable. This game looks and plays more like a badly written budget game and I am very surprised Ferrari would even put their name to the Wii version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is sad when you figure that an older version of the same game is better, even slightly. They ported and somewhat modified the graphics (not the gameplay, more on that later) of the GBA version to the DS, and it didn't work. I already did a review of that game. This one, though, fares better because it looks and feels better, like it was meant for that system. Those are the only praises I can give as it is the same old boring dungeon crawler with no story, boring characters, terrible art, and gameplay that hasn't been innovative since the 90s. A good attempt from a budding company? Maybe. But they have to up their game if they want to make a dent in this industry. Too flat, too common, not enough effort. Do not buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

too complicated, looks nice but that's it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So bad... I'm really disappointed.
Voices are really poor, the hero has a deep dark cliché voice, there are no emotions at all...
Animations are horrible too. Very slow, unrealistic...
Took me half an hour to start playing because the game was crashing. Why ? Because i have more than 4 cores in my CPU -_- Had to change that manually and restart the whole computer in order to play.
5 minutes after starting the game, it crashed on the "jump" tutorial. Had to restart 5 times to be able (i don't know how) to pass this point. I think i've a pretty decent computer (everything to ultra by default), but still, the game was slightly laggy (every 2 secs, very small freez, and sound sometimes jumping a bit). Tried to set the game to the lowest graphic settings with no change at all !

Game mechanics and enemies are almost the same than Risen2. You start on an island and meet no less than 9 different type of enemies, one after another... Problem is that you fight all of them exactly the same way. Fights are hard, but not because it's meant to be ! It's because 2 times out of 10, your hit will miss for stupid reasons like not aiming perfectly at the enemy pixels, or terrain elevation.
Still, monsters have no problem hitting you and chaining attacks like pros. And don't get me started on multiple target fights, where you can't even properly choose your target !

Programmers where lazy too. Climbing a ladder ? NP ! Just fade to black and teleport player on top ! Need to climb ? No need for a climbing animation, just use the jump then teleport to the anchor point and let the camera rape your eyes while trying to follow the  motion !

I loved Gothic. I Loved Risen so far. But this one is a piece of crap. Poor game play, bad Risen 2 clone, lot of bugs, terrible voice acting and animations... I really hope they'll do something better, but for now, it's a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrible its not even open world the areas are so confined it feels like an rpg on rails.
The story is so cliche and boring the side quest are more dull usually kill x amount of monsters and collect Y amount of loot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, it's not as garbage as Risen 2 was, but it's still a bad game. Every aspect is lacking, combat is laughable, the character system is pointless since the game presents everything it has in the first 2-3 hours and lets us to beat it without bigger problems.
Not ditching the worst pirate theme in a history, rehashing Risen 2's plot that makes no sense... The game has no direction and no sense. It was made because "it had to be made", even if the developer had no idea what to do and probable knew it shouldn't do it after all. And the players had to play it, just to examine why it's dead and why this developer shouldn't be making any more games.
It looks like a mix of different ideas, that were put in one box without no one checking if it works. A shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucked. It's not average. It's not bellow average. It just sucks. The story is terrible, and poorly written, recycling tons of cliches from about everything, and you freaking play as Christian Bale. I'm not joking. He looks like Christian Bale, he goes around being a douche to everyone and he is generally uninteresting. Just like every character in the game. I didn't like a single character in the game. Not one. Hell, I can't even tell the difference between most of them because they all look and sound pretty much the same. In fact, this game reuses character models and even entire villages from Risen 2. Why? Because it is Risen 2! Zero effort, and no improvements what so ever! Combat is a joke. It's one button and a block. I'm serious. And because of this, combat is extremely hard, and not in a challenging, tactical way like in Dark Souls, it's just impossible to beat anything other than rabbits because they have light and heavy attacks, and you don't! The game randomly picks for you. Stupid. Also, the graphics are still as crappy as Risen 2, with low res textures and some just ugly environments. Boss battles are QTE's. That's it. But it's better than playing the actual combat. I poured 80 hours into this piece of **** 80 hours of boredom. If you buy this game, it will happen to you too. STAY AWAY! STAY FAR AWAY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! 10? People are rating it 10? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!...No but seriously don't buy this huge pile of carbage...don't even torrent it my god it's just awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is the perfect example of a bad game. Bad art direction, bad animation, bad sound, terrible gameplay, terrible story... It looks and plays like some low budget title made in the early 00's, and not in the good way. Comparing it to the Gothic series is not even a possibility. Every aspect of this game seems like a joke.
The first Risen had some good RPG elements, combat, atmosphere and story. Risen 3 has nothing of it.
Don't buy it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this game. Found the world to be interesting and felt compelled to explore it, however.. this game has some really REALLY terrible controls and feels clunky as hell at every turn, and I had it setup for use with the XBox controller..

The voice acting is pretty bad, to the point where it was just annoying to listen to less than an hour into this, and why did it seem like "Bones" voice changed suddenly after being obnoxious for 20 minutes? While I did feel compelled to explore what world was presented to me in this title, I wont.. because it just feels like a terrible chore to even play this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I played this in the massive boom after release. It was fine for a while. I genuinely enjoyed the concept. Nice worlds, decent *enough* combat system, which was a hashed out Spore creature phase.

The flaw is repetitive nature and the ramping of difficulty. Whoever's behind it has absolutely no understanding of RPG  hack and slash genre. I read with my own eyes people asking for account resets in forums so they could start over.

There is no 'winning' in this game. If you think simulators don't have win scenarios, fine. But this game literally can't be completed. You play as far as you're able to and then that's it. Let's say you walk to the grocery store every day. One day, the sidewalk is slippery from ice. The next day, the ice and then a fireball is flying across the sky. Then combine that with sirens going off. Eventually you're literally flaring your nostrils trying to take in more air to relax you while the 7th chain of enemies is coming in, praying to Jesus and Muhammed that nothing else will appear so you can finally complete the level. Then you retry the level and get a spawn so easy that makes you think you're playing dozens of levels below your difficulty.

Your real life friends will get bored with this in a few hours, and then you're in trouble. There is no making friends in this game. You do everything you can and you don't know why levels can't be completed. You will always think it's the other person's fault if you're playing CO-OP. You can't logically comprehend a game being so impossible. Then when you try the level alone after that person disconnects, you're only able to keep your interest for so long before you decide you won't be returning to the game.

If you want RPG/ hack and slash meets Spore, play a hack and slash and then play Spore. You will get nothing from this game. It would be neat to try for a few levels if it were free, but I can't in good faith recommend this game to anybody. I would feel like I deserve to get punched in the face, which is just about the same feeling you're going to have while playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a fan of MAXIS and their work but sadly in this case with Darkspore, they did not deliver... It was not long before i gave up on this game entirely as it repeats the same simple process of Start Mission>Mobs>Kill Mobs>Obtain Loot>Kill Horde>End Mission... Besides bashing things there is nothing else the game offers other than some pretty graphics... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucked. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks. The music is a **** and the gameplay is awful. The greaphics aren't so bad but they aren't good. Everything that makes Yoshi's Island a good, this game makes bad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible graphics, horrible story and very short lived game play. Do not buy this game, rent it, and only if you have nothing better to do than play a cheap knock off of a RE game who's programers were more interested in making a few bucks than in producing a good story with lasting value that would actually add to the RE series of great, top-notch games! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a huge FIFA fan and a particular fan of the international competition efforts from EA, I had high hopes for the Euro 2012 expansion pack. Despite rumours that EA had binned the development off and handed it over to Double Helix games and the complete lack of news coming from the EA headquarters, as a loyal FIFA buyer, these issues were simply brushed under the carpet. It's a FIFA game, it must be good, right? Unfortunately not. First impressions were actually quite good, the layout is very nice and the atmosphere of the tournament is spot on. The expedition mode is a nice touch aswell. But, it doesn't take long for the faults to become blindingly apparent. Firstly, EA's claim to have "over 50 FIFA registered playable nations" is the grandest piece of misleading advertising I've seen in a very, very long time. Yes, there are 50 playable nations, but many of them aren't licensed, including no less than the two co-hosts of the tournament, Poland and Ukraine. If you were hoping to get Wales to the finals, you'll be doing so with the likes of Gareth Belt and Craig Belmont as your shining stars. That leads nicely onto my second point, because I've made a mistake there, because no, you can't take Wales to the Euro Finals and thats because, rather strangely, the qualification campaign is not playable, making the whole games playability very short. You have a selection of the 4 final groups and you can only rearrange them to include other nations, other nations undoubtedly filled with fake players, kits and emblems. I'm both genuinely upset and appalled with the UEFA Euro 2012 expansion pack for FIFA 12 and the lack of game modes and effort put into its conception by EA. The rumours that Double Helix, creators of Silent Hill Homecoming, were going to be the developers of their first football game went down like a storm in a tea cup on the online forums. Unfortunately, their effort would have probably been far superior to this diabolical shambles offered by EA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No qualifiers! Really!?20â 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

well Opoona ,
fails as an introductory RPG, and if you want to buy this game you may well be burning your money
and i dont know how you guys can think this is a good game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this game a two because it has only two things going for it: graphics and customization. The game looks fantastic and there is a huge roster of cars with loads of customization options. However, even though the game looks good, the open world itself sucks because it's always night time and for some reason its always raining. Another thing that really put me off were the live action cut scenes, they're just really boring and kill immersion. The characters are flat and missions are not as well designed as previous NFS games. The worst part is that this game is always online... that just sucks. Whoever decided to make this game always online needs to go f**k himself. This is a critical design flaw as online interactions are very rare. This game would be better if they just removed that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A Need For Speed title that requires constant online connection yet lacks  a proper multiplayer racing feature. I was prepared for many of the aspects of the game to be bad or lacking but... this? What a stupid blunder by the game developers. The game also loves to stutter on Xbone, civilian cars randomly disappear all the time, even fully tuned cars rev only till 7k rpm, using handbrake to throw your car sideways can reduce your speed from 200kmh to 0 in less than a second, soundtrack is small and not memorable in the least, rubberbanding AI is a real pain in the ass.. the list goes on and on, I probably forgot half of the problems the game has.

Worst of all, after 15 or so hours of playing I actually find myself enjoying the game, especially the touge area is really fun to drive. This game could've been so damn good but without actual multiplayer race lobbies the game has hardly any replay value and won't live long :| 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Need For Speed 2015 is a disgrace to the Need For Speed name.

The gameplay is just straight up horrible,with terrible physics,a counter-steer system which makes drifting near impossible,and considering that drifting makes up a significant portion of the game,this makes the game a chore to play,then you have the awful rubberband AI along with having to be always online to play the game.Then we come to the decent but extremely overrated customisation system,which is nice but with the awful gameplay it doesn't mean anything.

The graphics are great,but the framerate needs some serious work,like most of the game.

Then you have the cringeworthy,downright pathetic and the ''actors'' who perform these scenes are awful.

The sound design is good,but the soundtrack is awful.

Overall,Need For Speed 2015 is an awful game that has made an embarrassment of this franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring "linear" shooter, even Bethesda calls it "RPG". No different "hit zones" (apart head and all other) For a RPG it would get 0 , as Metacritic "First Person Shooter" describes Bethesdas last games better, I will give it a 2. (But since level 6 you feel already like in a god mode) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This DLC does everything wrong that Fallout 3 does right. More often than not there's only a single path to take and when there's choice you'll find doors locked behind you to make sure you cannot explore the other option. Sometimes you cannot leave the room until you've figured out which button to push. And so on. This DLC constantly bosses you around and tells you how exactly to play it. Make 100% sure you save before you start the DLC so you can opt out of this crap. I didn't and now I have to bite the bullet and finish it to return to the real game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's an FPS. And it's linear. What else is there to say ? There is no exploration, no choices, no RPG elements... I mean, it's not even a good FPS.

Want to know why I don't rate it 0 ? Because I like the outcasts outpost as my new home, and because at last some opponents use sneaking tactics against me (who sneaks the entire game.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2/10 only because of F1 game now being available for PS4.
The game itself cant get much worse anyhow.
There's time trial and quick race left, which both has been destroyed by insane bugs, glitches and penalties including time trial "track limits".
Going on Kerbs might black flag you.
More shallow than any previous F1-game now without career mode. Yes, they left it out completely.
Also, codemasters somehow thinks forcing you to play difficulty settings every car game has if you just crank em up is fun.
Its not, AI crashes you out while game takes care you get penalties enough thats impossible to do 100% races.
Online is worth seeing, but only in youtube fail compilations.
Online cars fully stops or randomly speeds through walls etc. giving yellow track while you get penalties after penalties for just driving.
Codemasters probably really hate their F1-license. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can you say 'vote padding' much? The graphics were dull and lifeless back when they game shipped, the controls were overly simple, the first 5 or 6 stages are mostly indistinguishable from one another, the enemy designs are neat, but are hampered by ugly textures, and the game overall lacks a feeling of freedom, as using the wrong legion during a fight will get you stomped. The people rating this game 10 are either blind, ignorant, or are very annoyed game devs who feel the need to make their game seem like an underdog. Less fun that Devil May Cry 2. Bottom line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought RPG Maker 1 was the coolest thing ever. I had no experience with game editing before playing it, and you can probably imagined that I was confused as all get-out at first. Well, me and my friend were both in the same boat on this one, but every weekend we would go to each other's houses and work on our games, imparting what little knowledge we had learned over the week to each other. After about a year or so, we decided we were pro. If it was CAPABLE of being done on RPG Maker, there was no doubt in our minds we could do it easily. Most people can't even concieve the idea of making a boat that you actually get in, and ride around, or making a general lead an army forward (all of them moving at once), then turning around to talk to his troops, then all of them moving forward at once again. Or a base designing sytem which allows you to have place to store, and manually choose your characters while upgrading the base and selection of items its stores have to offer. Oftentimes, even the most pro RPG Maker players are perplexed by how to script such things, and if you know how you are pro too. I am self learned from the days I couldn't figure out even how to make the inside of a house, so please do not think I am giving this game a bad review because it is confusing. I eagerly awaited this game for so long, and months ahead of time, I knew it would have bad graphics. So did the first one. The fact of the matter is you simply can't have that much customization, and have good graphics to boot. This was no big deal to me. When I put this game in, I had no idea the horror that awaited me. My first problem was the controls. There are so many places in the game that lack menus in favor of "To do this function rotate this analog stick this way, and then this way!" which is ridiculous. I'm trying to design a game, not play one. There should be no challenge to getting the game made if you know what to do. That being said, the method of gameplay for if you don't know what to do is awful as well. Begginer and Moderate difficulites set you up with so much pre-made data you're not making your own game anymore, but if you delete it, you are on advanced mode, in which hitting people doesn't even do damage unless you script it to do so. It's bad all right. Then comes the most awful thing of all. Almost all scenario scripting doesn't work correctly. Set a teleporting event using the X,Y,Z coordinates precisely, then test it, and watch as the game manages to screw a simple command like that up, making you teleport at all kinds of crazy and random places! I'm suprised Agetec was able to make the half-decent test game at all seeing as how almost 5% of stuff you script bugs out if you're in Advanced difficulty. Just plain wrong. I honestly would have settled for the old RPG Maker with a variable option, better control of duplicate events, and the freedom of the room of a PS2 memory card. Battle scripting would also have been nice. If they would have been smart and just added those, you'd have the tool you need make anything happen. Overall, RPG Maker 2 just isn't user friendly be you noob or pro. Bad controls, bad scripting, bad starting data. At least the map editor was pretty cool. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hate all of the ghost whoever came up with that was stupid. If you had a sims game not based on ghost you would make a better profit, please come up w/ something better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ants simulator, mess edition.

The fact that, for the campaign, I had to play an elf, the unwanted plague of fantasy cliché races, is far from being the worst aspect of HoAE. Even with his ridiculous voice acting and dialogues.

What is really, really bad is that everything is so tiny that I have no clue what any unit looks like, what it's doing, which side it's on, etc. I'm basically watching swarms of colored pixels clashing under the constant swirling sound of a toilet flush (the horrible music being turned off as usual.) I get that games think they are cool because they don't offer a pause (they do it so that we don't see the flaws while pretending it's for the challenge,) but what this one truly needs is a bloody zoom key, since we don't have 40 inches magnifying glasses to mount in front of our monitors.

Do I even need to mention the terrible micro-unit micro-management ? I Guess when a creature is only 4 pixels high, there's no room for putting a brain inside it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You have to undrestand my frustration.  I've bought the game,  started it... got through registration, finally launched the proper game... I've waited 10 minutes in freaking matchmaking lobby... And then... Match starts.. LAGS!!!  This game is terribly optimized... Pc port sucks major ass. How can i review Gotham City Impostors, if my game lags like hell ? It's totally unplayable, framerate drops BELOW 20fps.  That's a total DISGRACE. There's no actual explanation  for such bad performance, this game seems to lag without any reason. Yes, devs promised patching this and other issues. IN MARCH. Suck my %^(#. Really.   Two points, because this game seems like a great fun... I will change this grade to higher IF IT'LL ACTUALLY WORK.

2/13/2012: This game is **** It is for all intents and purposes a Call of Duty clone, and a rather thinly-disguised one at that. Quite literally, given the intentionally shoddy quality of the costumes the characters wear. Its got fun items like a grappling hook and double jump boots, and is far more vertical then CoD, requiring you to battle for control of rooftops and the skies. However, it has a crippling player count (Six versus six, AT MAXIMUM) and very few people seem to have bought it anyway. It also has some glaring balance issues, endemic to the CoD generation of shooters, such as the clear superiority of certain items and perks over others, one-hit-kill sniper rifles (headshots optional), rocket launchers with ridiculously generous ammo counts and so on. Add to this mix only three multiplayer gametypes, the cursed consolization that is Matchmaking and a tiny number of maps, and you have a game that is barely worth the already low price. You're better off playing Space Marine. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love thought-provoking walking simulators with their relaxing slow pace and abstract level design. I HATE pseudo-philosophical 1st person platformers. It is simple rule. Wanna make surreal interactive art installation? No problem. Just let me WALK around and WATCH. Wanna make game? Learn how to construct game rules, mechanics, goals and obstacles. Never this frustrating and nonsensical crap in-between 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simplemente una copia sin mejorias de grandes Juegos de este tipo como Saints Row y Grand Theft Auto es lo que me decepciona, triste historia para Electronic Arts 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Vanilla only and FPS dropes. Thx, Ubisoft, keep it up, so we can hate you more and more. There is nothing more to say, but my review must be at least 150 characters long. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Heroes 3 is in mine opinion best game of all time, but this HD reskin is bad joke by Ubisoft. Graphic looks worse than Heroest 3 HD+ fan mode. This so called HD edition dont even have expansion packs.
Doesn't have autosave!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Minor graphic enhancements at the expense of missing expansions, online matches, random maps and FPS. Play the full game instead. If you buy it, at least buy it from GOG or any other site which sells it cheaper. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why all the love for this being playable on an Ipad? This is specifically, and bannered quite clearly as a review of the PC version of the game.  It's not even as if you get the Ipad version free if you buy the PC version, they are completely different products.  The choice is simple. You can buy this, less than half a game with some HD sprites that look marginally better (marginally). OR go to GoG get the whole game, all expansions,  random map generator, fan patches that work with it  -  and free maps - for less than half the price. That works perfectly well and silky smooth on all operating systems (Win 98 through to Windows 10). Why you would spend twice the money on less than half the game? Who knows. It gets a couple of marks for the base game being as good as it always was. Ubi didn't cock that up  - but why they bothered for PC players is beyond me when a much superior and much cheaper version is already available. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When i was ten, my friend recomended me to play HOMM IV. I liked it. Then i found HOMM III and i loved it. It was so fabulous and entertaining, so i thought HD remaster will be even better (800x600 resolution was not very comfortable), but what i got is... is just horrible. This "remaster" is the same game as in 1998 but with blured textures, bugs, without addon support and without normal multiplayer. We can just download the fan made HD patch and have HD resolution and more options. And not spending money for ths "remaster". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Clunky, awkward, and not very good. Hard to use force controls and a lack of first person view both suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, it's fun. It's Star Wars. It's one of the worst ports I have ever seen. No AA, No Bloom, restrictive resolutions. If you are going to port a game to the PC, port it right. I have a PC because my GPU kicks PS3 butt. So I see no advantage of buying this for the PC. I want my AA, I want my Bloom. I want my 2048x1152. Hopefully this will be patched. I doubt it though, and I won't buy another stupid Port. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed in this game and very surprised that Lucas departed from a winning interface.  Perhaps the most disappointing part of this game is that it is an obvious and very poor translation from a console game to a pc game.  The GUI and screen displays do not work well and are very frustrating.  I have played the KOTOR series and love those games.  Those games were a huge hit, so it is puzzling why they changed the interface.  Save your money.  This is a waste of disk space. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This POS is the only game I rated so low on Metacritic.
This is A BLATAN CONSOLE RIP with extremely unresponsive controls. Targeting system is horrible, there is a lock system mechanic that just PLAIN AND SIMPLE DOES NOT WORK.
Examples: - you press E to force-push a weakened enemy and your character turns around striking an enemy across the room instead, ignoring the auto-lock
- you throw an explosive container at an enemy, and instead of throwing forwards it throws it to the left or right to hit another container because targeting system thinks you always want to hit the closest target when throwing (because logic is overrated)
While the game does have some potential and nice animations, particle effects and what not, I just couldn't get myself to enjoy it with keyboard and mouse. Whoever was in charge of making the PC port FUDGED IT UP COMPLTELY.
Also I expected numerous glitches with level geometry, disappearing textures and what not.
This is not worth your money nor your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yeah, I don't get the point of this.. Lets have a really poor storyline and tack it onto the most popular multiplayer shooter at the time and then make it single player.... er... What were you thinking. If you want single player counterstrike grab the bots. If there had been a really good storyline attached I could have seen a reason for the release of this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a dissapointment. it took valve way to long to take cs 1.6, and add bots (wich by the way are shit) and make you have to unlock maps. i hate bots so much, and i think they should be taken off of the game. they sit there like retards, atleast make them smart. half of the time they sit in a corner and stare at an enemy through the wall, who is also hiding in another corner.... make a better version of ce, one that has 1.6 graphics with added features. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game sucks do not play this piece of crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrible if you want a good action game play devil may cry it is way better than this piece of crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Journey to the Center of The Earth just feels broken. The controls are off, the visuals are bland, and the gameplay is dull. Not to mention, the protagonist doesn't seem to be able to do things that should just be simple. My top example of this is the gloves. Need to fix some wires? Nope, you need the gloves on. Need to chisel out a gem? Nope, need gloves. Not to mention, the game gives back no input on this, so you have no idea what you're doing wrong. I have the disc version, which means it has the seal puzzle. Now, I've tried the correct combination of gems on the board. IT DOESN'T WORK! I even checked 10+ online walkthroughs. The puzzle doesn't work! The story is also uninspired, but the voices... AAAAHH. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the frontline but hate this one. Graphics are terrible, levels extreamly easy, and the weapons are very unrealistic. Come on, why do I have to shoot some one 5 times with a 30-6 rifle? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The controls are weak and untuned the graphics are bland the gameplay is linear and boring the swinging on pipes is ridiculaly buggy and the combat is a beyond bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is really fun to play with family and friends. It has a variety of sports to play and there is a large amount of different Mario and Sonic characters to play as. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor Graphics, poor audio, pure failure. This game hits the nail on the head of 'Glitch' and corrodes depressively by trying too hard to concept so differently in comparison of other Role-Playing Games. The Complete misconception consists of unrealism by enabling  the ability to forge an item with another item of it's self, in a combination of greater power. Overall, The game exceeds an outstanding 10/10 for bug exploration. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointingly it's almost an exact copy of Oblivion just far worse in every aspects. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Couldn't last more than 3 hours. Game crashes often (that is, if you succeed in making it work in the first place - as of 2008-01-07). For the quality of graphics, I find the game a little slow. I was disappointed to find that you can't play the main storyline in multiplayer mode. I'd like to be a little more thorough, but my patience has limits. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will not talk about the "game". (Hint: there is no game it is yet another walking simulator but this time with teddy bear).
I actually want to ask the developers when they last time visit the eye doctor? This is very honest question. I am concerned about them. True. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Critically limited in the tools available to anyone remotely serious about making an enjoyable gaming experience, this is not for anyone who has any experience in past RPG Maker titles, or those who wish to do much more than make a map, make a character, then have them wander around aimlessly.

At surface level it seems interesting - the map design is made easy by the touch controls, but that's just about where it's merits end.

Here's a small list of the major mechanic limitations I've encountered in 2 days of play:

-heavy limits to specific creation areas in the database: 16 classes, 16 party characters (total possible throughout game), 64 items, 64 weapons, 64 defensive equipment, 99 monsters, 99 battle groups, 99 MAPS (hope you don't want a massive game world!)

-zero interface dialogue alterations. Every battle for every user will end with
"has
X experience
X gold

" in a large empty box

-almost no unique event options; want conditional branches? In this software, you can't have them. There is no room for "if switch = ON make X happen, else Y", it just isn't an option. This is but one of the critical tools in story creation that are missing from this.

-party stats are locked to their profession; you set the value they are at level 1, and every level it will increase by that amount. You can't make items that increase this, or alter them in events, this is the system you have to use.

-equipment only alters one stat for each piece; no heavy equipment possible that increases strength at a cost to speed! No special equipment that increases several stats, it's again take it or leave it.

Honestly, I could continue for a long time listing features I would consider very basic for a game maker, nevermind an RPG maker; it is obvious on a portable system they wouldn't include a script editor, and that was something I was prepared for - but there are countless fundamental basics you cannot do in this game. You can make text, you can move events, you can manipulate them with switches and variables (as long as you don't want too much of an impact to occur in the event manipulating the values), and that's about it.

There's also the content issue in terms of games assets. In terms of the RTP they provide, it is quite expansive - to a degree. The basic set has maybe 100 or so character sprite / body image combos, each with 4 colour / appearance alterations; this is large enough to have diversity in games, but not large enough if you're wanting your game to be along the lines of a Suikoden clone or the like - and this isn't possible anyway, with a max of 16 per game. Tile-wise there's 10+ pages of ground and object sprites, plenty to make world maps, varied towns, moving water in ports etc - and they're all easily implemented. The trouble is without user content or a mass of additional DLC in the future these will be a problem. In the 2 days I've played around with it, I made a large world map, I think 10 or so villages-cities, several accompanying dungeons, and a few random houses - and I've used most of the tiles by now. You will need to be incredibly creative in you map design to make these last a game's length, never mind making your game appear different to everyone else's! This may improve with time, but given the Day 1 DLC being 4 or so packs priced around £3-5 each, it doesn't seem likely.

Lastly, the editor music. Oh my days. You can listen to the one track ad infinitum while editing, or you can turn your sound off. You can't seem to select an existing song you're matching to the map you're designing even, to help keep the mindset needed for the situation.

Sorry for the wordy review spewing out of me here, but I felt strongly enough about the limitations that I made a meta critic account simply to get this out there - most of the reviews seemed average - glowing, with little being said about the downsides of the software - and they are critical to anyone not making a game in an extremely casual way. RPG Maker FES does have a market - people extremely new to game design, who are very casual in their approach to telling a story; if you have an RPG in mind, and a story you would like to tell in a similar style, don't bother; there is no way to even come close to matching what you will have in your head with this. If you just want to tell small and silly stories that you can have your other friends with a DS to play, go for it - their system of upload and download of games is certainly robust. If it weren't for the pitiable lack of functionality otherwise, it's worth in my eyes would skyrocket. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Short. Not innovative. No nice bonuses. Adds nothing to the Mass Effect 2 experience. Takes place in a bland and rather familiar setting.  This DLC should have been give away for free to Mass Effect 2's loyal fans; instead they give us a full-price DLC that's half the length and half the originality that it should be.  It fails terribly at getting me excited for Mass Effect 3.  It succeeds only in irritating me that I actually paid for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply put this game is a discrace to all fighting games... it's too slow paced too incredibly easy and the only people who actually go out and buy it are dragonball z fans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To be honest, i never played SUCH A BORING game in my whole life. Seriously, pressing 1 button over 9000 times isn't too exciting to me. Same maps, same enemies same attacks... Only thing i liked about this game was the music, it was kinda cool. But overall, it's the worst game for PSP ever! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bought it for my birthday that first week when it came out, due to the hype and visuals that looked like it was an updated Dungeon Keeper. It was unplayably blech. I'll give it a 2 for the number of hours that I played it. At least I had some decent birthday cake that year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game got the same syndrome as Dragon Age 2 - they wanted to make spiritual successor of other classic hit game (DA2 from Baldur as Dungeons from Dungeon Keeper) but instead of making exact copy with better graphics they started to improve it, fixing and being creative plus rushing production and as always when you try to fix something that is not broken you can be sure that you will brake it. They broke it. they broke it baaad. They used to much illegal substances at their brainstorm where they got those ideas implemented in Dungeons and I'm sure they were stoned then because they not even sound fun so what was the point in selecting them? I mean instead of creating space for your minions so that they could train and multiply to create mass capable to destroy other lords and all those crazy heroes attacking you all the time you're now creating fun place and statue-like minions for those heroes so that you could charge fee when they want to leave. But it's not those heroes should have fun - I should! And I don't. And they knew what they were doing - because even if they would only give your minions possibility to move and you to control them it would be totally different game where you could slain every hero just by number advantage - this would kill whole game concept but would also make this game a lot more fun than is now - and a little more like DK. I'm not bashing this game because it's not DK - dont get me wrong - I'm bashing it because Kalypso made some suggestions this game will have something in common with DK to feed at DK fanbase (like me) when there is almost nothing in common. Except ripoffs like dungeon heart, graphics, dungeon creation method, crazy heroes and so on and so on. All of this wouldn't be also a problem if this game would be good or at least medium - but it's no fun to play and because of similarities to DK you just have to compare and this compering just K.O Dungeons 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a disappointment! I'd fall asleep playing this game if I didn't have to constantly scramble to complete timed missions that are only there to keep you from realizing how bored you are. This game resembles nothing more than a poorly made tower defense game that had a freak child with Roller Coaster Tycoon. It's really sad, because the game looks pretty and had potential, but some genius thought it'd be fun to pamper your enemies...(evil my a**) while they bumped and stumbled their way into my dungeon, to get happy and then wander into a monster pit. Wake me up when it's over. No freedom to dug my OWN dungeon, no freedom to research stuff, and my minions aren't so much minions as they are punching bags with about as much personality. Don't even get me started on how buggy and unstable this game is. Just avoid this game. If you want to take a chance when it's sitting on the bargain bin for $5 (which will probably be very soon) knock yourself out, but in no way is a tower defense game worth $40. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was a total disappointment. These guys would've been better off making a dungeon keeper clone. The monsters have no AI whatsoever, talk about gaming companies taking a step back - well these guys took not one, not two, but three steps backwards in so far as AI programming and game potential are concerned with Dungeons. Imagine a game with near "Sims" type AI for each of your monsters and traps vast and various, but no... these guys went back to 1985 and threw in the AI from the monsters in doom 1. I feel this was a vast waste of money I could've better spent buying pizza for a night playing BC2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring, tedious, buggy and wrongly hyped as being similar to Dungeon Keeper. It's not, and even disregarding that fact the gameplay is slow, tedious, repetitive and simply not very fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the glitchiest game I've ever had the misfortune of playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game was promised to be a revolution in the gaming world. it was incredibly disappointing to find that the graphics were, for the most part, horrible, especially in the animated cut scenes, the driving levels were a joke, the environments were crappy and unrefined, there were some major glitches, the gameplay overall was bland and monotonous, and what the hell were the designers thinking when they made the last levels? ok, we are going to have the player just run for about 10 straight levels, then driving through some dark tunnels. wtf? the only fun parts were at the post office and power plant. other than that and the few cool things you could unlock in the hacking mode, this was a sorry excuse for an action game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Spend your money and make them rich scheme. This game is bad, it should have been out in 1999. The graphics are just junk. Gameplay, jump kick shoot bulle-time like maxpayne. Controls and levels are similar to shinys messiah 1999(aka gutter levels). They are not going to get their act together unless people stop buying this game. Hocky maket scheme for kids, matrix fans to buy this game without thinking. So thier game messiah which came out in 1999 has better graphics then matrix. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No no no EA has killed another need for speed
physics are terrible, its very annoying to drive and the story are crap. I also had some problem installing this on my computer. I do not recommend this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really have nothing to say about this game. I installed it on vista. HUGE PROBLEMS. I gave it another chance. Installed on XP. MORE PROBLEMS. Indeed and the worst part is that I don't find much of a difference between this game and the Most Wanted. I hope if you're thinking of getting this game, get Burnout Paradise instead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game is disappointing as it tries to be like NFS-Most Wanted with high HD requirements like higher RAM & graphics. There was a much higher expectation from this game but it failed. Wild cop chases,cut-scenes & excellent driving cars makes it a bit cool; but it has tons of problems whilst playing the game which annoys the user & makes it unenjoyable!! NFS should make it a lot better!! Better luck next time guys!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game doesn't bring anything new to the series. Just like every EA-game so far... Unrealistic handling, boring storyline, boring races with nothing new to them etc. This game was just like playing Carbon, except the graphics were amazing and the best so far. There's few new things, such as taking out some "gang-members" by crashing into them which was just stupid. The game ended by taking out some other street-racers and that's it, also the game was way too easy. I have bought few NFS's, but I'm not gonna waste my money on any of them anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The 360 version of the game was great 2 years ago. But the fact it is a Co-op that still isn't functioning a week after release shows extreme failure by Overkill. It seems they need new management. This should have been a monumentally successful launch. Instead it turns out to be the worst single player campaign game I've ever experienced. Save your money until 2017 they will have it patched by then. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hard to review - after about twenty attempts, still unable to get into a game. I don't mind single player, but this game doesn't have single player, so... Bottom line, you'll probably have more fun grabbing a shovel and just burying sixty bucks in your yard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trash.  Multiplayer is completely broken and unplayable.  Which is kind of the entire point behind the game.  Not sure how you can release a product and call it "finished" and have more than 50% of it completely unusable.  I'll be looking for a refund. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is stupid. how can this dev release this game? its unplayable (yes yet another game!) - everytime you try and attempt to log into crime net it freezes, therefore you cant really do much, ive had it since launch day, its a complete waste of space so im selling it. The dev has recognsed there is a problem but i still believe its unacceptable that the game is released like this.

I tonight attempted the offline mode as thats the only option available to me and its a complete pile of rubbish, the AI is beyond stupid and its just painfully boring. SELLING THIS GAME TOMORROW. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After spending 40 days 12 hours and 12 minutes playing this game for the Xbox One I can say that the game is horrible. The game haves you assume the role of a criminal who robs banks, frames people, and rigs elections, although the games perks and weapons either make you completely useless or completely overpowered. If you know what to pick for your perk deck, skills, and weapons you're fine, but someone who is new to the game will most likely struggle and find this game confusing. The amount of content may look amazing at first, but with enough play time the heists you want to play and the weapons you want to use will become limited. Now if you're looking to step into Death Wish difficulty, game will become better, somewhat. This difficulty is the only challenging one to anyone with a comprehensive brain that functions, but this may allow for people to play some beginning game heists again for a achievement, but the weapons, perks, and armors will become extremely limited in this difficulty. Now lets talk about the support that overkill gives the crimewave edition on both ps4 and xb1....... Yeah, there's none. After a year has passed this game still has no real connection fixes, no new dlc, and the PC version has had over 50 updates since the release of the crimewave edition, and that's not counting the numerous hot fixes on the PC. If you're looking for co-op fun, go buy Left 4 Dead, Dark Souls, or GTA Five. Left 4 Dead is a co-op horde shooting much like Payday, Dark Souls is extremely challenging, and GTA is the best criminal/ heist game I've ever played. If you want to try this game out, don't buy it. Rent it, or borrow it from a friend. Don't give the scumbags at overkill software your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really unhappy with the direction this game took the series in. The speed is gone, maneuvering your robot is a chore, buying new items is confusing and the visuals are sub-par--textures on the mech models are muddy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Good: Graphics are pretty and the story starts out pretty interesting.

The Bad: Everything else.

The combat is blatantly stolen from the Arkham games but it's dumbed down immensely and slightly broken. The platforming is horrible and lacks polish, actually the same can be said of all gameplay elements. Camera angles are incredibly annoying as well, sometimes leading to you getting hit in combat without even knowing what's hitting you.

It's also short, which given that it's basically an interactive movie...that might not be a bad thing. On the hardest difficult I beat it in about half a day.

The story also trails off and just gets weird instead of interesting by the end, which is sad because it's one of the only things the game has going for it.

I suggest you save your money and just watch youtube videos of people playing it if you're interested. You'll get the same value out of it and save a little time and money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was always interested in this game since I first saw it. It looked like it could have some real potential.
I then proceeded to forget about the game until I saw it on special offer on Steam. I figured why not and downloaded it. Sadly it doesn't compete with almost any game released in the past 10 years or so.
The graphics are in dire need of some work, mainly the poor textures and shaders make it look a little dated.
Sadly it doesn't only fall short there, the gameplay is extremely linear. The game isn't so much a game as a story with a menu screen. You are directed, with no perceivable allowance for exploration, to each objective. Episode 0 is a good indication of that as it sets multiple waypoints just a few metres apart for you to follow. The only control you have is with the "combat" system. You can choose how to beat up some truly terrible AI opponents, as in do you punch or kick them. That's it, but in all fairness they're so stupid that you only need that much choice.
Platforming sections? Of which there are quite a few, are a poor mans version of tomb raider. No alternate routes, no challenges. Simply follow the only direction you can possibly take.
Then there are the memory remix parts. Rewind to start and look for blurs, then slow it down and click. Move to next blur and repeat.... yawn. Though clever in concept it's too simple and basic in application.
The voice acting is pretty good though, I liked the voice acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Game as most people before me have said is a great idea for a game it just has that problem of it being poorly implemented. The on of the bosses for the most part unbeatable because the game gives no indication that I'm doing jack to her, and don't say "well you ain't good enough" because I am because I got to that point in the game on hard mode with only 10 deaths so if I can't figure out what to do then they've got a serious problem. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull dull dull.

Borrowing cues from fan favourite Secret of Mana, this game promises much but delivers nothing. A repetitive Diablo-a-like that just isn't fun. Each level feels like a trudge. The bosses look impressive, then die in a few hits without any challenge.

There's nothing to recommend here. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worsed Games i ever bought full price. Even imported it to play it together with 2 other friends. Well we never finished it. This Game simply has no point. The Itemsystem is too boring to get the "Diablo effect", the Monsters and even the Bosses are  far too easy so u wont get any challenge at all in this game. No funny unlockables or any other point to play this game long, twice, or even more than like 4 to 5 hours. So 2 out of 10 from me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Remember that PS1 game "Independence Day" from the movie... Well this game is just like that... only more of a waste of graphics and time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is unreal how short this game is. I have played previous Pendulo games and generally enjoyed them, not sure what they were going for here.

The story itself is mildly interesting but lack any real direction. There is too much bouncing around or at least bouncing around in a way you don't get until the end. There is also too much hand holding. This is one of the first adventure games that basically gives away the clues to every puzzle. Extremely disappointed. High points were graphics and voice acting. Lowe points, playing the "game". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Five reasons this game is absolute s h i t e !

1. I needed community support to even start the game.

2. Game-mechanics are somewhat booring. Rather limited options for doing anything, and unless you know the tricks you'll be doing absolutely nothing the first half of the game.

3. This game is drudgery galore. It's main game-mechanic consist of organizing your troops into a proper chain of command. Doing this is about as time-consuming as in real life. A cluncky and unintuitive interface makes this chore into your own personal hell.

4. HoI3 is spent waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never does.

5. You have to go online to learn how to play the game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought "Slender: The Arrival" because I needed a good health and fitness game. Sadly this is disappointing. I don't think I've lost any weight since I've started playing this game. And for some reason, the fitness instructor only shows up for a second before disappearing every time. How am I supposed to learn good health habits from someone I can't even talk to. All and all, for a game with "Slender" in the title, it doesn't do its job.

O.K., this game had some scary elements. Things would pop up on walls that weren't there, the music was well made, little common horror elements were used well. However, the game was just a misfit. In the first Slender the Slenderman was actually a jump out kind of horror that was O.K. for a free game. However in this addition he appears so often it becomes so routine it is like killing grunts to avoid him. He doesn't kill on sight all the time. There are two other enemies in the game, neither of which pose any threat or are scary at all. There is a tiny outline of a story in the game, but it is boring. and is too secretive. Also, the game tried some Amnesia-esque mechanics (click dragging doors, collecting notes to put in a journal, etc.) that really just didn't fit.

Too Human was the first game I ever bought for Xbox 360 and damn, was I scarred for life. This game was incredibly bad and was probably the worst games I have ever played. Although, this game did have some neat mechanics that didn't really expand. For example, the different types of guns were randomly generated but I didn't actually get a variety throughout the game. The story would be the biggest let down, it only took me 5 hours to complete! I took it back to the game store after 2 weeks of buying it because I was so disappointed, what a way to start with the Xbox 360.

I so badly wanted this game to be the kind of work that would vindicate all the hard work that Silicon Knights put into this. Instead what I found myself playing was little more than a button smash, hack and loot game. The thing that drives this game forward is the single minded pursuit of better and better loot. No matter what level your character is the cookie cutter bad guys scale to match you. All too often you make the effort to "craft" an item only for it to be rendered obsolete by some random loot drop. The gameplay can be summed up rather nicely by the phrase, "Shower, rinse, repeat". There is little more variety than this. I have played many games with poor gameplay in order to participate in a good story. Too Human also falls terribly short in this area as well. The story is little more than an introduction to the cast of characters. Leaving only multiplayer, which I cannot comment on because a gold Xbox Live subscription for a year would nearly double the cost of this dreadfully disappointing game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible game. the demo sucked and whats with the 30 second video when u die 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Animations suck, camera sucks, overall game play just isn't there either. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really, really, really wanted to like Too Human.  It had a lot of elements that interested me, mixing Viking mythology with science fiction seemed interesting and new.  Then I actually played the game and found it to be the worst game I had ever played.  Mapping the attack button to the right thumb stick was just idiotic.  It would have been better if say... you moved the thumbstick towards an enemy and you attacked that enemy instead of leaping somewhere to attack something off screen.  I would have felt better paying someone else to play this game so I could watch because the story is quite good.  It just gets ruined by every aspect of game play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just play through the demo four times and save your money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is it that this game got such a high score. 68 for a game with repetitive game play, lousy graphics and poor QC. Don't bother with this one if you must then either rent it or wait for the bargains. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Forge has alot promise and might have bright future as great PvP-oriented game. Sadly, its still way too incomplete to offer any incentive to keep playing other than few matches and is filled with small bugs, nothing gamebreaking, but annoying ones(So called "Domino effect" in particular). Given time, those small annoyances will probably be fixed(along the reward system). Id also like to see the game gathering larger playerbase, as now its hard to have even 5v5 games. They could have also post-poned "Launch" that was 4.12.2012, as the game is nowhere ready to be launched.Concluding, i wish all well to developers and will continue monitoring developing progress.

This is a poor show from firefly. Rather than innovate and add new ideas, features and concepts to the original stronghold crusader all they seem to have done is remade the same game with the terrible engine they used for Stronghold 2, 3 and Legends. I really used to like this company, but their continued failure to innovate means if you have played one stronghold game you have played them all.

Stronghold crusader HD is available on steam, and is the exact same game as this from a gameplay perspective without the terrible graphics (the old graphics are far clearer) and is currently £22.50 cheaper than this piece of junk, even on ultra it looks like a drawing you might have on your fridge. I really can't see where Firefly have spent their time on this, it is definitely not worth the £30 they are asking, looking through the menus I counted 1 new building the "artillerier" or something equally retarded which I believe is just a renamed "Engineers guild" from the original game?

If you have fond memories of stronghold do not waste your money on this game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just wanted to point out one thing which seems to go unnoticed, and that is the broken economy. Why? Well, the answer is the dumb candlemaker who produce the candles ex nihilo; out of nowhere! And how does that affect the gameplay? You simple build a bunch of candlemakers near your stockpile and set autosell from your marketplace, and take a look at your income: you get so much gold that you won't be needing any other resource at all! So, to win the game it is enough to build candlemakers, sell some candles, buy some wood, build more candlemakers, and so on... The key is that you can do all of that inside your castle, so you don't need to go fighting for mines or grass. So why would anybody bother with guarding that stone over there, when 150 candlemakers are the most productive manufacture ever! Therefore: the broken economy system.

Also, everything that Trickedagain stated is true; I would only like to add "no moat" to his list.

And one more thing: The spearman is now man-at-arms, right? And he throws the spear before attacking the enemy in melee. The thing I would like to see is a cooldown meter for this ability, so that I could know when my men-at-arms are ready with a new trowing spears. This would allow them to be used as skirmishers, with hit-and-run tactics, which would add a strategy depth. And this is unavailable because it is uncertain are they going to shoot the enemy, or to thrust him with spears.

There are much more things wrong with this game, but I think most of them have already been pointed out; I would only like to advice people not to waste too much hours on this game, it's just not worthy of your free time or nerves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The good:
1-3d Graphic.
2-More units.
3-Much cheaper mercenaries.
4-The Shield units gets a huge improvement you need only 6 to have your troops protected.
5-Weak AI characters like the rat are much stronger now and use catapults.
6-Formatios: yay that's new no other strategy game thought about that !!!.
The Bad:
1-All wooden buildings look very ugly and only the walls and the keep look nice.
2-Placing units on the wall gives them no protection ever as archers will shoot through the wall.
3-Units animation is so terrible especially the woodcutter.
4-The music has like only 4 new musical pieces and 4 old ones from SH Crusader 1 and all the new ones are terrible and unclear.
5-The sound effects are all from older versions of the game no creation whatsoever.
6-Wood cost of all buildings are extremely high (inn 200 -house 65-weapons production 50).
7-Wood production is lowest I have ever seen in any game each hut which costs 20 wood gets you 16 wood every 2 mins and could take much longer if the warehouse is farther away.
8-Again ranged units is so overpowered but that was always the case in older versions
9-Arrows don't miss targets ever and I saw an arrow shift in mid flight to hit the target!! I wonder if they use homing arrows ?
10-Units on hill shoot farther than units on tower even though the tower is higher.
11-AI characters start attacking after 10-20 sec only instead on 2 min good luck players.
12-AI characters build units faster than his economics would allow and they are cheating bigger and better than before.
13-Walls are super weak and very expensive it's useless to even build and would be better to build towers and delay building walls until later when you have like 500 stones.
14-No more Siege engines  on big towers no you build a stupid weak wooden tower which is very weak archers can destroy it after like 12 arrows only and it costs 300 Gold WTF!!
15-No moats or dry moats it's gone forever.
16-No more siege towers or ladder-men.
17-Game price is 50$ but it's worth only 15-20$.
18-Playing against 7 enemies is impossible in fact playing against 3 enemies means defeat because they each send 30 units every 40 sec and will swarm your castle not to mention siege equipment.
19-Some bugs here and there.
20-Campaigns and missions numbers are a lot less than SHC 1.
21-units overlapping is a big issue and some times 10 units occupy the same spot.
22-NO tool-tips for units damage,health or defense even the stop order doesn't have a tool-tip! super lazy developer.
Overall 2/10 the game sucks big time in its current state. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I bought this game on whim last week, anticipating it's release. I have not been so disappointed in quite some time. I loved the original Stronghold games, they were unique, engaging, and charming. In between have been some not-so-great entries, but the devs promised that Crusader 2 would be different.

Shame on me for trusting the devs and pre-purchasing this piece of garbage.

If anything, content has DIMINISHED from the original Crusader, with a mere 3, yes that's right, 3 tower types, the removal of leather armor, no more building animations or greetings from peasants, and, what stunned me the most, RECYCLED AUDIO from previous games. Your units say exactly what they said in Stronghold 2.

The graphics, while not great, aren't a problem for me. It's the fact that this game has taken a step back from it's predecessor by dumbing down the system, rather than a step forward with new content and more features.

Also, the UI is not very good in that it offers no explanation of WHAT buildings do in the form of a mouseover tooltip, which I had thought would be a no-brainer in any strategy game. Of course, you can find this information in the in-game encyclopedia, but I think that just shows how lazy the devs were with this game.

I don't usually complain about games, and I'm pretty easy to please. When I saw that the same guys from the original Stronghold team were working on this project on their own, on top of their promises of not repeating past mistakes, I thought it would turn out great. Boy was I wrong. If I could get my money back, I would, and I have literally never said that about any other game ever. Not because this one is so bad (although it is), but because I feel betrayed.

The first Stronghold Crusader may have been a labor of love, but this one just feels like a chore.

This is the worst hockey game I have ever played. I have an hard time finishing one game. The graphics were better on gamecube and it's something I can not understand. 
I think I will sell my Wii now.

I tried nhl 09 on ps3 and it's 10 times better on all department.

Now for the analysis: 
Gameplay is bad. It's basically impossible to prevent the player from shooting and the game is mostly rush + shot opposite team rush + shot. The controls are interesting but they lack depth and they surely don't make up for everything bad in this game.
Graphic is the biggest flaw of this game. It looks very very much terrible. NHL 2k6 on Xbox had way better visuals. You would expect a next gen game to look better than the previous one. But that doesn't apply here. Even the nhl games on gamecube looked better. 
The Wii is much more closer to the ps2 than it is to the ps3. The game library attests it with ps2 remakes like Okami and Resident evil 4, that are both on the Wii top ten rating, minds you.

The all time best hockey games goes like this for me:
NHL 09
NHL 94 (snes)
Ice hockey (nintendo)

Un jeu étonnament beau, dommage que ce soit un étron de la pire espèce : maniabilité atroce, difficulté artificiellement et inutilement élevée et sauvegardes très espacées pour rallonger une durée de vie faiblarde. Un découpe-les-tous navrant. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As Sonic huge fan, I have to say that this game is lame.If you are looking for Sonic like games, don't go for it.If you are looking for a challenging game, don't go for it.If you are looking for good plataform srtyle, don't go for it.So, in a few words, my advice to all sonic fans is: Don't play this game.If you are not a Sonic fan, you may like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

seriously my father bought along with this game the sonic mega collection and enjoyed this but my god and very buggy has a bizarre graphics horrible gameplay and all of that game sucks 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this, I really did. I even came back to it a few weeks later to give it another shot, but it's just utterly unforgivable garbage. Pros: Pretty visuals (after you manually fix broken files to get the textures working), interesting concept, nice sound track. Cons: Default controls unplayable, control remapping only half works and most cannot be remapped, downloads with broken textures, settings randomly reset themselves to defaults, dry uninteresting voice acting, bland mission objectives are always "kill X of this or Y of that" counters, AI copilots accomplish most objectives for you so there's no sense of involvement, buggy, unresponsive menus, need I go on? Maybe the game could be good if they did some QA and got it working, but there's just too much work required to get it in a playable state to have any fun with the monotone voice telling me to kill 20 more identical fighters for the umpteenth time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is ridiculously hard. They came out with difficulty settings on it and even on Easy, it is ridiculously hard. It's frustrating, not fun, not challenging, just surprise you're dead for no reason. Or sometimes, surprise, you didn't get the goal because you couldn't get to it fast enough because humans aren't meant to track 5 things in the sky at the same time in completely opposite directions. Whoever directed this game, this should be your last game. It's a beautiful pile of anguish that I wish on no one. I'm so disappointed that I gave you my money for this. I will make sure not to do so in the future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really a treeible thing, not bieng able to choose the resoloution or controls. Well the controls are fine by me (I learn fast !!!). But i really want to increase the resolution. I got a 7800GT and it really is a shame to be playing at 800 x 600. (looks more like 640 x 480) The Anti Alaising was fixed with the control center for ATI and nVidia so that isnt a problem. On the whole the game is crap because of the camera angels. I quit playing this game and switched back to Farcry for the time bieng. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadful game with completely unresponsive controls. A crime. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A total waste of money. The game must be named Errors of Might and Magic: Install error, Uplay error, crush errors, deleted saved games errors, etc etc etc 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst wrestling game i have ever played. the regular nintendo system made a better wrestling game than this and i don't even remember the name! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A very bad game, with poor game mechanics and a terrible story.  I recommend you read Destructoid's review of this game before even considering a purchase. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total failure. Story is boring and short. Cover system is broken. Some enemies are like minibosses. AI is straightforward, just rushing at you. More and more... I just can't think of a good thing about this game. Stay away. And don't even believe any of the review(er)s that gave this game a good score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really a crap game made by- and for- people who think mindless swearing and a lack of imagination is cool . 2 points for the look of singapore, or shanghai, or whatever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's much less breathtaking than it looks. The puzzles, at least during the first hour or so which was all I could endure, involve pressing light switches to move floating light sources around that make certain platforms appear and disappear. At first it looks like a clever mechanic like Closure (but in 3D), but it's really just switches. In HUGE levels, with no particular idea of where you're supposed to be going or why. It isn't open exploration, there's a linear route - and it's just intentionally not marked out well, or indeed at all. It's like: if I crawl through this little space here and jump over these boxes I'm in the "next" area, which is much like the last one except the boxes are a different way round. The gigantic scale looks good, but it's dull to wander round it. Another game that had this problem was EYE: Divine Cybermancy - if you've played the particular couple of maps in that with vast outdoor areas that take five minutes to walk across but have nothing to interact with or particularly look at on the way, that's pretty much NaissanceE. Only, without anything to do at the end of the long walk, or anything to look at on the way other than grey boxes.

Another puzzle that annoyed me early on involved navigating down a big grey "lift shaft" type thing by hopping from ledge to ledge (long drops kill you forcing a return to the last save), and the puzzle is that the only available light source slowly drifts up and down the middle of the "lift shaft" so that you have to wait 30 seconds between each jump. I hate it when games make things difficult in the game that would be easy if you were physically there - and in this case could feel for the sheer drops at the edges of the ledges.

I'm being really down on this game. It does have a moody, mysterious atmosphere going for it. But probably so would Halo if you removed the plot and replaced all the scenery with grey boxes and put a sort of pixelly filter over the front of everything. And it could well have profound spiritual revelations waiting further into the game, about loneliness, or whether anything means anything... but I just have a creeping suspicion that I could get the same revelations by walking around a shopping mall at night wearing dark glasses. They seem to be patching it lots, and it's a genuine indie not a cynical cash-in, I could just have done with more freedom to get lost walking round a huge grey building, the linearity at the start was a huge disappointment. Back to Anti-Chamber for me! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you played Puzzle & Dragon, Quiz RPG The World of Mystic Wiz or any similar F2P game on mobile, you will instantly be familiar with Destiny of Spirits.

Like most of F2P, the game revolves around you spending real money in order to actually progress "faster" or keep playing without having to wait.

The gameplay is pretty dull and doesn't really require much input from the user beside activating skills and assigning targets. These are the only TWO actions you will ever do. So basically you are playing a Spreadsheet battle, you spreadsheet vs the computer spreadsheet. All you will be doing is killing the same monsters over and over, only numbers are going to increase with time.

The whole geolocation feature is just a gimmick and doesn't add much to the game. This feature would have been better if it was working more like Streetpass instead. Don't waste your time and money on this.

I really would like to see such business model to be purely and simply banned. Putting users in a skinner box to have them spend cash on a mediocre game is just an awful practice. This game could have had potential if it would have been sold like a retail product, proper £25~£30 pricatag, an actual gameplay, and a game design going further than a spreadsheet battle.

Do not download, don't waste your time. There are better titles out there on Vita. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor console port to PC. It deserves a 2 because it has a story at least, but is let down by the poor controls, especially moving around... Keep console games to consoles. Nice to be able to set trip bombs etc...

With improved controls (more common to a FPS) this could be a great game... Shame it fails on so many levels. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

+decent killcam

-terrible AI
-terrible stealth
-very repetitive
-regenerating health
-checkpoints every 5 steps
-objective markers everywhere
-boring shooting mechanics for non-sniper weapons
-very linear
-killcam is really the only decent thing about the game 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just do not know what to say about this game, everything is bad here, The only well made thing here is killcam. Stay out of it, one of the worst games I've played in a long time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes - sniping is fun.... Yes good bullet physics, but otherwiseRepetitive, and dull gameplay.stupid and unrealistic ai.Started the game and never finished it.Dont waste money 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a disappointment! I was expecting a sniper game and this is a run and gun: as soon as you fire once, everybody runs around and at you shooting, so you end up running around and shooting as well. I'm so frustrated I bought this and wouldn't recommend it. Yes, the bullet cam is cool but you get used to it so the fun doesn't sustain long. Also, tagging is useless because even if you take your time, observing and tagging all enemies, after you fired once, new enemies spawn at random places. That's a SHAME! The worse part has been a mission that starts by securing the ground before searching for your contact. Once it's done, you get a message: "The place is secured. Go meet your contact". You go down and new snipers spawn and start shooting at you! This is simply preposterous.
To me, the only game so far that delivered the real sniping thrill is Sniper Ghost Warrior. I don't understand why critics destroyed it and acclaimed Sniper Elite V2. I guess people just go with the hype instead of searching by themselves what truly works. This is screwed up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay first of all, I decided to try the Sniper Elite V2 because the first one had some nice ballistics and such. There where many flaws and I hoped that they could have fixed some of those. But no, they haven't really done a thing to fix things. AI is one of the worst I have ever seen... For exemple I throw a grenade and the very moment it doesn't touch characters had ALL the enemy's even behind walls start to run and yell.. I have seen some enemies through some doors and they couldn't come through. I decided to play the game through once just not yet there. Whole game is a complete ripoff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What happened to this series?? I've owned every JD game for the Kinect - hey, it's a great workout. But THIS? Terrible song selection, No World Dance Floor (Online) and a SUBSCRIPTION for old songs? Dance Central had a one time charge to import ALL the previous songs to DC3. Why this decision? It's like they're trying to kill the franchise. Top 3 franchises that killed THEMSELVES: Tony Hawk, Guitar Hero and now Just Dance... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nice looking but plays like the last game and the last game was one of the worst fighters ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First things first, Uplay is a JOKE.

This is one of the most unstable, buggy game I've ever seen, can't quit the game properly, it choose to stuck in my memory for no reason. I have to reboot to get rid of it from my memory.

Controller don't work, I have a flight stick connected and it choose to use my keyboard instead, way to go UBISOFT, you suck at PC resales.  And you wonder why PC version don't sale as good as console? Because you don't put efforts in it that's why. Your game don't worth my money, it doesn't even matter how good the game itself, technical side don't work and the game don't work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thís is a junk, not a game!

1/ The Character's Creation Screen is terrible. They don't let us ZOOM to your characters.
2/ Why they don't let us LEVEL UP like the other ARPG games instead of using THE SATISFY BLOOD POT.
3/ Why there is no any option to change your QUICK SKILL SLOTS instead of Freezing them.
4/ The character at level 100 is the same power as level 1. WTF?
5/ Buying a game with too many bug at the first "Final Arena" make the VWOM worse than a Flash game. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this game a two because it has only two things going for it: graphics and customization. The game looks fantastic and there is a huge roster of cars with loads of customization options. However, even though the game looks good, the open world itself sucks because it's always night time and for some reason its always raining. Another thing that really put me off were the live action cut scenes, they're just really boring and kill immersion. The characters are flat and missions are not as well designed as previous NFS games. The worst part is that this game is always online... that just sucks. Whoever decided to make this game always online needs to go f**k himself. This is a critical design flaw as online interactions are very rare. This game would be better if they just removed that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tries to recapture Need For Speed Undegrounds glory days, but fails miserably. Let's get all the bad out of the way first. First off, it needs a constant internet connection at all times to even play it. Yeah, it is an always online game! The weird thing is, it shouldn't even need one there is no reason for it at all. All past Need For Speed games didn't need a constant internet connection to play, so why does this one? My internet can be quite patchy, so i found myself unable to play the game at all while my internet connection was patchy. Also, because it needs a constant online connection, the game does stutter quite a bit in places. It spoils the game entirely. The handling is awful and takes a long time to get used to. I've played a lot of racing games over the years and get used to the handling pretty quickly. But not with this game, it takes a time. The game world feels empty and dull. As a result the game get's very boring very quickly. The cut scenes are just laughably cringeworthy and bad. They try so hard to be cool that they fail miserably. The A.I is poor. I've been about half a mile behind, only for the other racers to slow down until i catch them up. Once you catch them up, and you will catch them up stupidly quick, they all of a sudden want to race again. They have done this in an attempt to make the races exciting, but it just feels silly. All race games have a form of catch up on them, but this was is the worst because it is so blatently obvious. There is also no option for manual shift. Which is very odd given that this game has a lot of customization. The customization is one of the only good things about this game. There is quite a lot to customize like previous underground games.  Just a shame the rest of the game spoils it. The graphics are good in places. Sound is also quite good.  So, if you are looking to relive the glory days of Need For Speed Undergound 1 and 2, forget it, its not happening with this entry. There are glimpses of nostalgia, which is what it is going for, but they are so poorly done it doesn't compare to the Underground games of the past. It doesn't even add anything new. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What is going on? 2016 year! No wheel support only for PS4! PC version of this sh*t have wheel support! Are you kidding EA? Driveclub, Project Cars have wheel support! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I absolutely HATED this game.

First of all, the handling. It ruins the entire game. You can tell this game has been created for casuals as the road constantly has a driving line plastered onto it which you cant turn off, and when you steer off the suggested driving line slightly your car actually drags you back over to it! which takes away all sense of control over the vehicle...
Then there's the drifting mechanic... It's shockingly bad. There is no in between with this game, either you're in full on drift mode or your car has severe understeer which sends your car smashing into wall and there's nothing you can do about it other than just grind along the wall until the car corrects itself.

Story - Non existant. Ridiculous constant phone calls from your 'friends' who talk absolute mindless ****

Only pro's are the graphics, which do not alone make a good game.
I still got the platinum trophy for this game as it is easy however my thoughts whilst playing were 'My god this game is bad'

Avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Need for Speed (2015) is the worst Need for Speed in history.
The story and acting is ridiculous and these horrible cutscenes are not skipable.
90% of the game is just drifting. It's pure drifting, team-drifting, time-drifting, race-drifting and sprint-drifting.
Let's just call this game Need for Drift, cause most of the time it has NOTHING to do with fast competitive racing.
The controls are okay but feel way worse compared to all older titles.
The AI is pretty bad and especially the cops AI is so bad I can't imagine a worthy comparison.
And than there is the Always-On feature. It's the worst decision ever taken after Sim City. Lost connection, saving failure after races, everything occurred not just once, but couple of times and you can't pause a SINGLEPLAYER Game.
The only two things that are not completely horrible but nothing worth mentioning are graphics, which are kinda okay but lack a fluent presentation due to the stupid framelock and the customization IF you mean color and decal customization, because for most cars there are like 2 or 3 parts that can be changed at max.

Ghost Games, please just quit your jobs and stop punishing us with this crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very disappointed by this game. I loved NFSU, NFSU2, NFSC, NFSMW, and somewhat liked NFS undercover. After 4 hours of constantly trying to like this game, I gave up. Here's what I think about this game:

The most annoying thing about this game is how it feels like you are waiting for something to happen about 50% of the time. Whether it is a loading screen, waiting for players to join, or watching dumb and pointless cutscenes. The pop ups, phone calls, and things are also quite annoying and take away from the actual game. Once you are done with reading and going through menus, you may begin to play the game.

Multiplayer is actually very buggy, and cars tend to teleport everywhere, from my 4 hours of experience. Apparently devs still dont know how to make proper connections with players that are stable in 2017, or at least EA.

The biggest reason why I absolutely hate it is because of the sheer randomness and confusion that it seems like. There is no theme it feels, and it is like we are racing for literally no reason. Cops are ridiculously easy, and can pretty much never bust you. There didn't seem to be any really progressive heat levels either, a disappointment. Cops are so easy and can't control any racers to any extent. AI is also rubberbanding, and do not actually have skill.

The handling of the cars is actually very difficult and frustrating. I don't like the idea of all of these assist things as well, the path that lights up for you, and such. Id much rather build up my own skill and play the game on my own and witness the raw handling of vehicles. The handling is artificially difficult it feels, and it seems every time I try to go around the corner, i find myself oversteering or understeering, and I found the only way I even stand a chance is if I drift on every corner. Very annoying and unrealistic, and personally I have never had a harder time with a racing game as far as just controlling the vehicle.

You never seem to be able to get a grip on how the cars handle so you can actually race properly. To me that ruins everything. It feels too random and luck-based. It is so difficult it is actually unrealistic, more like an artificial difficulty.

Though the game looks very nice, its also locked at 30fps, and has DRM. Doubles it up worse.

I really tried to like it, and this is making me hate EA's new 'vision' of nfs games. I hate them all. Most wanted 2012, this one, rivals, hot pursuit--they ruined the franchise.

It's like the game is trying to be realistic and unrealistic at the same time--it can't make up it's mind.

OMG, what a let down. Where to start
- Car customisation is weak - you can work with the cheaper cars, but higher up its.....theres nothing
- Frostbite engine is a fantastic engine but they opted it for it to be constantly raining with little bursts of daylight. What tropical rainforest did they destroy to build a city where its always raining
- The acting - OMG
-  Cops, seriously, too easy or too random, you can have the slowest car and you've lost them within 10 seconds and sometimes they appear out of nowhere. Ive had to chase cops just to get them to chase me.
- Getting called by for example Spike to meet up, the same Spike you're currently racing
- RUBBERBANDING AI - I can crash at the start and still catch up, AI can crash at start and still catch up

My final point: Buy The Crew, it is so much better, with better customisation and will also have a Ferrari F40 soon via an update. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I put off buying this because of so many mixed reviews, but I got the PC version.  I was done in 3 days. The visuals are impressive, but the design left a lot to be desired. There was no replay feature!  The city feels dead and boring. The AI is so easy I don't even bother challenging them.  Not enough real players online.  I can't save multiple car setups to be recalled before a challenge or event. Invisible cops that don't chase you buy raise heat level to 3 instantly and other weird stuff.  I recorded some of it here https://youtu.be/_YcGxW1mNs4 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story is quite boring, pointless and the gameplay is too sexist to be enjoyable. It's like a bump in the success road of other engaging stories inside the assassin's creed brand. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game has potential - a really underexplored genre, but it is critically flawed because th game basically plays itself! Combat is monotonous, and you can actually have the game auto-fight for you for up to half and hour! No need to pay for expensive botting services, why not just get your own pc to do the playing for you! I'm disapointed. The game has some Korean screens appearing now and then, and the translations are sometimes a bit funky. But if it was fun to play I'd be a fan. Sadly, not yet in this case. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Beautiful graphics Thats it...... the same thing like most of peoples... Where the Create Player?? Come On EaSport this is the most important things for a lot of peoples and you forget about it. I quit Ea Sport just for this... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

NO CREATE A PLAYER. MENUS HAVE GLITCHES. CAN'T CONFIGURE YOUR CONTROLLER. What happened EASPORTS. This game has so many bugs it's uinbelievable. 2004 wasn't perfect but I'd give it an 8/10. 2005 is a 2/10. Very very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'd have to agree with mostly everyone on here and say that this game is pretty bad in many respects. First, there is no leader board to monitor your players individual stats in comparison with the league. Second, no create a player. What were these guys thinking? Most game players love the fact that they can create a player and view his stats with the likes of Hull, Sakic and Modano. EA did a poor job with this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is horrible! While visuals have improved, nothing else has. First off, the interface is totally unattractive, and is frustrating to use. Its harder to actually sit there and change lines in the coaching screen. You have to switch boxes. Boxes? Whomever thought of that is an idiot. And gameplay leaves me feeling very frustrated. While its good to get the opposing de more aggressive, they are too aggressive. I get hit every single time I just enter the blue line. I cant make a play other than just shoot. Its pretty pathetic. And where is features like create a player? Creating teams to actually IMPORT into dynasty mode? I like the addidtion of the refs and coaches faces...its nice. Again, the visuals are the only good thing about this game. All it boils down to is a hit-fest. This is beyond what arcade hockey should be. Go back to the basics and make it more real next time. I borrowed this game from a friend, and I wont be buying this or anymore titles from EA until they get their act straigth. Piss poor game overall. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a piece of dog p... They took out all the intricate details of AI customizations so your left with huge skill gaps between Begginer, Easy, Medium and Hard. In fact it's not even a difficulty setting. They should call it a retardation factor. At medium all your player become retarded and can't pass nor avoid any hits. The goalie starts to convulse for no reason. It's no wonder this game is going for 0.99 cents on EBAY. They aslo took out the creat a player function. What idiot decided on that? I guess when the designers and the programmers of this version were on maximun retard mode when they came up with this peice of barf.

The first king arthur was a clever turn based strategy game meets rpg elements which successfully mimicked total wars open world nature which nurtured the wonderful natural storys you develop with your generals.

This game throws that away in favor of a heavily linear experience with dumbed down management. In short it trys to tell you a story some people love having there hand held forcefully through a story so for them this might be a plus, for me the simplified mechanics (in an already rather simple strategy game) and the extremely linear story made for a very disappointing experience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a mess. When a game makes you feel seasick, you know something is wrong. How the game manages that? Simple, in battles you have a crappy camera that barely shows anything so you have to constantly adjust it to see at least a little of what is going on. Worse yet, the game also has horrible camera controls and no less horrible performance that makes everything seem sluggish and slow to respond even with highend hardware. So you end up constantly moving a sluggishly reacting crappy camera around that moves strangely and is hard to control.... I really started to feel a little sick after a few battles and haven't played since. The game also suffers from crashes and some of the longest loading times I've ever seen. Best stay clear of it and should the scenario interest you, try the first King Arthur game which is much better. That game, even thought not perfect, I actually enjoyed playing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not sure I can really hold Nintendo accountable for this thing placed before me in the form of a game. It is a game in that you interact with it, and things happen, and someone "wins" but the hows and whys of that interaction are entirely random. The vast majority of mini games are luck based, though that is irrelevant. Winning the entirety of the game comes down, purely, to luck. The RNG is king here, and you are to bow to it's whims. The minigames can be fun, but the overall board game is a mess of poor design with a distinct lack of fun. Any positives that could be said about the game, the art and design of the maps, the interesting use of the amiibos for another game mode, really fall to the wayside of the god awful RNG. Subjecting someone to this game really should be a war crime.

Mario Party 10, the newest instalment in the Mario party series and the 1st for the Wii U is a party game where players choose their favourite Mario character and jump in a cart which takes them from start to finish along a path. During this time players will take turns as the cart driver and collect mini stars. The player with the most mini starts at the end wins the game.
The game plays similarly to Mario Party 9. where all characters are together as they move across the board instead of separate and on their own. This add simplicity to the game but takes out a lot of fun, skill and competition. Instead of collecting coins, and battling it out in mini games every 4 turns players hope around aimlessly on a path collecting mini stars and other things that chance lets them fall on. In a whole game you  might play as little as 4 mini games. And the winner usually turns out to be who ever was lucky enough to get the mini stars rather then who was skilled enough to win or smart enough to generate a winning strategy. This "all together" board movement and lack of actual play (aside from hitting a dice block) makes this game get REALLY boring REALLY fast. Every time you play a level, it goes basically exactly the same as the last time. There is little to enjoy, little to change, and little to come back and play for next time.
A few of the good things is that the game has a side game called "badminton" that is pretty fun and the mini games are fairly fun, even though you almost never play them during the actual play of a "party" game.
The game sticks with the standard Mario style of graphics and does look good on the screen. There isn't any eye popping amazing visuals but it then again this is a standard Mario Party game, and what you get is exactly what you expect which is what makes this perfect.
If you are buying this game for your small children the enjoy then they might like it, if you are like me and a life long Mario fan, looking for a new Mario Party game that will be fun, competitive and long lasting then DO NOT buy this game. Go plug in a N64, Game Cube or Wii and play any of them from Mario Party 1 - 8.
Lets all hope that if they do come in the future with a Mario Party 11, they return to the individual, continual board, turn based length, mini game after every turn style of game that it used to be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The game looks nice and the mini-games that aren't impossible are really fun but sadly the game is too luck based with the roll of a few dice almost completely controlling the game. Its just a shame that it is so random and requires so little skill. Nintendo looked at everything good in the old wii version like the bosses and lots of mini-game that occurred commonly that required skill, and removed them, leaving a game that is only really enjoyable once if that for anyone older than 5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wasn't huge on Mario Party 9's change of gameplay from the Mario Party series so I was very disappointed with Mario Party 10 decided to follow in the same footsteps. The car mechanic still forces you to rely on luck and even then it sometimes seems that the CPU players given a luck handicap. Even to play mini-games is a matter of luck, as they are still triggered through spaces. Bowser Party is often heavily tilted in Bowser's favor, which makes the game feel one sided. Even if the Amiibo Party is the closest thing to the original gameplay, playing through even the default ten turns is more tedious than it is fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seems like this was made for a really young audience. The minigames are a lot more random/luck based than skill based. The "shared car" concept where you all share a game piece ruins the competitive fun. The old games resulted in a minigame each round, where this seems like turns and turns of rolling dice and moving around the board before entering in a minigame. Sad and disappointing waste of $50. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible game that disregards the past 9+ games of friendly competition. The level of challenge and visuals are targeted towards YOUNG children. The game isn't about competing with your friends but working together to accomplish a goal, with the best team player getting the most points. The visuals and animations are great but drag on and reminded me of the learning cartoons targeted to 2 year old's. (I'm not exaggerating)

The worse part to me was the recycling of games. Instead of having different games for the different modes like free-for-all, and 1-on-1, etc,  you sometimes play the same game. I would've loved to play some of the older games in HD,  a weak new game, or anything. Instead, we get a change the number of players.

CONS: Load times, challenge of games, promotes cooperation instead of friendly competition, same games across the few game modes, you can't skip enough even though you can skip a lot.

PRO: My youngest nieces and nephew can play it, and understand the rules(which is a con), the visuals during the rounds entertain really young kids.

You can't leave them with the Wii U but you could play it with the kids in which it's targeted, and hope they have fun. I'll bet Nintendo just wanted to sell expansions, so they released a game without quality control. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst games I've ever played hands down, played this for 5+ hours and am going to return it tomorrow. This coming from an experienced video game player who has played hundreds of games since childhood. I used to love Mario Party when I was younger playing on the N64 and the Gamecube, and I thought it would be fun to pick up a new one to play with friends and family. Boy was I wrong. This game feels VERY unfinished. Almost as if I am playing a demo for the official game, or a beta build. The game has three modes with very linear outcomes. No changing amount of turns, no setting time limit, no control over what goes on really everything is already set up for you in a poor manner. In all three modes the boards follow a very simple linear path that take no turns, no surprises, it's the same every time you play.  Sure there are some fun minigames, but in these modes it is more-of based on plain luck and randomness for you to win, no skill to win minigames needed whatsoever! Not to mention there is a very small amount of minigames and I ended up playing them all and winning at least once within the first couple hours. Sure some of the minigames are fun, but there are not nearly enough of them, and there are quite a few that are way too simple and not fun to play. I definitely feel as though this game is intended very young children, possibly ages 4-7, because this game holds your hand and walks you through every step, all down to the amiibo support where you have to make the figure 'jump' to roll the dice every turn. This game is definitely not intended for anyone over the age of 13+. Unless you are plan on buying this game for your child DO NOT waste your money on this trust me! I am very disappointed in Nintendo for making a game in such poor quality. Not worth mentioning- visuals are okay, and the gameplay seems to be at 60fps steadily. Giving this a 2/10 due to the fact that I might have enjoyed this game when I was 6 years old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why do you do the horrible gimmick YET AGAIN and why do you NEED to have a wii u remote why can't we used the gamepad. The boards are bland, the bosses are so easy and the minigames are in total meh. And the modes are mediocre. But some of the minigames are decent and the graphics do look great. But still the game is bad though, really bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is not a very fun game and should be more of a 4.99 game rather than a 19.99 game. Blueberry Garden is probally even better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Kill five waves of ships in orbit to save a distressed vessel. Scan five anomalies in the system to send data to Starfleet. Scan five unmanned computer consoles in an abandoned facility to figure out why it's abandoned. Repair five breeches in the asteroid base so it can be inhabited again. Rewire five artifcats on the ground so they don't irradiate the pre warp culture you never meet. Kill five platoons of random enemy so they don't start a mining base on said planet. Ok, now use these few basic scenarios repeatedly only tweaking some script regarding motivation and ride that out to max level. Get to max level and waste into oblivion. This game offers one week of fun, 2 or 3 for casual players, until you realise you've been punked. Then you linger on because you're a trek fan and you just can't believe this is all there is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It starts out with a character generation system outdated by much more than the game's actual age, goes on with a completely heart- and soulless tutorial, an interface that is not only confusing and uncomfortable to use, but also incredibly ugly and leads into mediocre gameplay and horrid graphics. I am incredibly relieved that this game is free to play now, for I could hardly stomach how it must feel to have spent money on this. I'd have to get paid to play it and I'd have to get paid even more to recommend it without swallowing my tongue. Simply horrible and a shame even for the Star Trek franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your generic quest/grind MMOG. The multiplayer elements are completely ignorable as it is solo game by design with co-op elements added in. Not really impressed as it just like many other MMOGs out there right now who have already perfected their genre. I guess if you're a fan of the new age star trek (enterprise, the new movie and such) this is for you, older trekkies will find too many plot holes and retcons of the older series. TL:DR This game would be worth it if it were free, however the monthly fee is not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is a shame. It has no StarTrek at all. It is all combat, at space mainly, even the combat at ground is bad. I admit the space combat is fun to play, but all is space combat, no exploration, no diplomacy, no Star Trek at all. The skill system is useless. What is the point in having four officers with a punch of skills to level up, when you can only use five or six skills at maximum? It has no sense to raise for example 2 space skills per officer when you can only use 5. The missions are mainly go there and get an object, or go there and kill those guys. The klingon faction is a waste of time, no fun missions, no content, just a bit of pvp with a painful difficult level. Stay away from this game please. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst game ever. Already beat the game. Nothing special on this. Don`t buy it wase of money. Crypt = money $$$$. Don`t fall in this crapy game its not even close to a "standerd" mmorpg. Its more Starfleet command 4 not star trek online. However if you buy don`t cry. The misions are at 1 point nice if you follow the "story line"but when hit the maxs level its all about pvp/patrol misions. And let me say its real borring. I know i will go on the bad light but let me say this i have warn you. Don`t fall in this crap like i do. Even i have buy the Special edition and life time subscribe "yah stupid" so let me say don`t fal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a Star Trek game there is NOTHING about this game that is Star Trek but it's look. After 10 days of playing i had cleared ALL content on the federation side. Cleared all content in 10 days of an MMO, WOW! No diplomacy No exploration (what they have is a joke) Combat TOTALLY untrue to Star Trek. (ya. i was blowing up Negh'var Klingon Battleships in a 200 year old Miranda class.) I could go on listing massive issues with this game and its relation to Star Trek for a while. It really is that bad and i couldn't be more sad about this outcome. A game i had been waiting for for 10 years. A game I wish steam would give me my money back on. If you like mindless almost endless combat, this game is for you! If your looking for a Star Trek game, this one is FAR from it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A good attempt at the franchise but they could have used another year of development for the ground combat system (Champion's Engine), and the space combat is only good because Cryptic didn't come up with it, its a dumped down direct rip of the combat system in Starfleet Command 3. Personally, I'll rebuild an old system and play SFC3, rather than pay Cryptic. As a trekkie my expectations were pretty low, and even Cryptic was able to fly right under them without any effort, literally. Not good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whilst the game is great for Star Trek fans, which I am one of them, it will slowly fade into the nether regions of "terrible games". Visually, it's a nice game. Content wise, it's a decent game. Long-term playability it's dismal. I've counted up about 4 different activities you can do and all the missions are a randomization of those activities. There is a lot of positive reviews of this game because it's new. Give it 6 months and you'll find membership dropping and those positive opinions changing to "mediocre". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Graphics are okay but unfortunatelly i don't remember the sounds. Starting with a very booring storyline, and when you complete, than you can just after leveling. The characters modelling are terrible. Contains a lots of loading screen and this is the worst in this game and every (which have) MMORPG games. When i play with an MMORPG games i don't want to see a loading screen looks like WoW. Have a lots of ship battles in the space and this is also horrible. This game have a booring gameplay, and if you not really like, not try this. Free to play but i don't want to play it again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Buggy, laggy, and not fun. Yet another game that imitates a MMO in order to charge a monthly fee yet offers no incentive or motivation to actually team up to accomplish a task. Why are there games that do more for multiplayer while not charging a fee? Cryptic excels at squandering potential when it comes to game design. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have played this for four days. Giving it a really good go , probably knocking up 25 hours play time, and I'm bored. So far it has been laggy (almost as bad as Champions) but mostly offers no reason that I have yet found to team up with another player. This could have been a single player game, for £30 it might have been worth it, a monthly fee for a single player experience is certainly not worth it. And the lag really does get to you. A quick flick to EvE or WoW and you are quickly reminded of how smooth and seamless multiplayer games should be. Not to mention they should be multi player! (durr) this game offers no reason that I have found in four days to intereact with other players at all. I love Star Trek, I don't like this game. I have cancelled my subs , but would love to be able to return in a few months with a better experience. At the moment your subs are paying for a Beta game to have the contents added that shouldbe there from the start - like any semblence of multiplayer for a start 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible game. Lacks depth, substance, a dynamic universe, re playability. The game has nothing going for it. Ground combat is clunky, space combat is lack luster. No risk for the reward. Absolutely nothing deserving of the score it has received from some of the other reviewers. They are obviously first time players as this game is not a MMO. You can find all the same features in this game in your basic Game Spy Lobby game. There is nothing massive about restrictive instances and I believe Cryptic should be brought up on false advertisement charges for trying to pass the game off as a MMO. If Guildwars is not a MMO than STO is not either as they both use the same restrictive structure. I think I am being more than fair giving the game a 2, only because of the character creation and the alright graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The ground combat is not very good with some areas sporting eyeball blasting floor color schemes that leave you with a massive headache. Many quests are broken. The space combat is cool but repetitive and after about 10 battles you start wishing there was a way to bypass it. Speaking of space, it just doesn't "feel" like space. It's all far to small and planets and other objects seem tiny and much too close together. I don't like this game very much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terminally slow ship combat, dire ground battles, sketchy quests combined with a buggy interface ruin what could have been a great game. On entertainment value alone, this game just doesn't cut it and needs a massive overhaul if people are expected to continue paying their monthly fee. It's a pity as the premise offered a great alternative to the likes of WoW. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfinished, NOT Star Trek as 90% of the game is nothing but fighting. No crafting, housing or anything else that people come to expect. Worst this is this is NOT an MMO.... it's a 3D chat room with avatars used to for groups to go into private instances aka Guild Wars or DDO. The game was released unfinished yet Cryptic has the nerve to not only charge $15 a month but also put up a micro-transaction store in which you have to pay real money for some of the things missing in the game! If you buy this you are falling for their ruse.... just say no and move on! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best parts of this game come from the implementation of the intellectual property. The star ship and ground combat is fun but typically not well integrated beyond the core story missions. The end game content mostly includes instanced and battle ground play. If the game was not saddled with a developer hell beat on burying it and soaking the players for all they can get while digging the hole, I could recommend it. It is free-to-play so by all means try it, but avoid spending any money whatsoever. I have almost a thousand hours into this game so I do enjoy it but do not expect the developers to consider you  beyond your pocket book. There are so many other games that will give you a higher quality experience with better treatment, and it is only a short matter of time before I walk away from this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only positives this game has going for it are the ship models. The negatives start with the developer itself, Cryptic, known here after as Craptic. Craptic is just a horrible developer company with really bad customer service. They have 0 QA, their marketing deliberately misleads players in effort to get them to spend real money for their underwhelming video game items, and their customer service teams are basically paid to tell the customers "sorry, can't help you" when they run into a problem with STO.

The game itself is fraught with bugs, some of which have been around since the game launched. Not that I'm expecting perfection, but at least some effort towards remediation would be deserved.

Graphically, the game is unimpressive. STO has decent ship models but that's as far as it goes. The effects and animations are pretty lousy, like something I would expect from a 1990's video game. Game play is on par with the animations, unlike other MMO's, there's no strategy or tactics really to using abilities. You can just use ingame macro abilities to cycle every active ability you have as soon as its available and you've got a game where all you're doing is pressing a single key repeatedly.

Bottom line is, for me, that Craptic isn't worthy of getting my hard earned cash. The only reason that STO has a player base at all is because its Star Trek, and not even close to canon Star Trek at that. Really do wish someone else would come along and make a real Star Trek game. It'd be better than this crap... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do you like star trek? do you like exploring the galaxy in your starship? discovering new species? settling diplomatic disputes? well than this is not the game for you!

First a recount of my latest encounter with this games support:

After playing this game for years and having beyond hundreds of hours into it, a glitch in the game deleted one of my ships and with it all of my gear, after contacting support and going back and forth for several days they ultimately told me there was nothing they were willing to do to help me... nothing at all.

The bottom line is this is a dying MMO with nearly no effort put into it, there is NOTHING to do in the end game, which will only take you about a weekend to reach max level. The whole game should just be put out of its misery and cryptic should learn how to  re-evaluate how the currently treat the long term players and supports of this game, especially that still pay money to play a free to play game... They are an inept company that doesn't care about its customers
If they didn't have the star trek IP they would have gone out of business when Atari dumped them and part of me wishes they had...

The game play is weak, pretty much all you have to do is spam the space bar until you win, the writing and acting in the game are some of the worst i have ever seen, almost every "new" mission involves either time travel, and let me sum up ALL of the games story lines in one phrase - "The iconians did it" - This hardly mentioned in the show race is apparently responsible for every single event that has ever happened in the galaxy and has become Cryptic's all purpose excuse for poor writing and zero imagination every story line just leads back to an : it was the iconians moment...
There is nothing that makes Star Trek so wonderful and enjoyable in this game, no interactions with crew members, no dramatic writing, no exciting moments, no diplomatic responses to anything... simply power up shields - hit the space bar and pew pew to victory...

I think my time with STO has come to an end, I recommend if you are a current player you get out before what happened to me happens to you and if your considering playing it please don't, or at the very least don't give them a single penny of your hard earned money it isn't worth it and Cryptic/Perfect world simply doesn't care about any of their players and sadly I don't think they ever will.

Mario and sonic at the london 2012 olympic games was great, the wii version that is. but the 3DS version is REALLY bad. Remember all of those fun Olympic events and dream events that the wii version had, well the 3DS version throws all of that out the window. In the 3DS version you get weak events and a horrible story mode. the events in the 3DS version aren't even sporting events, you just mash buttons and you win, for example, instead of a full soccer game like the wii version, you just have to block a bunch of shots from getting into the net, after 20 shots you win, if you miss 5 you lose. these do not simulate sporting events at all, you are just playing an easy minigame to win it's horrible. so what if the 3DS version has more "events" that the wii version, half of the events are just mashing buttons or yelling into the microphone but I'll get to that later. for example, the 3ds version has a boxing event, but all you have to do to win is let go of the button before your opponent does, they just lunge at each other in slow motion and one punch and it's a K.O, this is not boxing, I don't even know what to call it, but it's definitely not boxing. and instead of being able to select any character you want for an event, the game has separated all of the characters into groups for each event, you can only chose a group of four characters for each event. you can't play as sonic in the boxing match, or bowser in swiming, nope you just have to chose out of 4 different characters for each event, the groups are, wild ones, heroes, tricksters, girls, and challengers, why can't I just play as any character I want, why? oh and even worse some events make you YELL INTO THE 3DS MICROPHONE, that's terrible, other events use the 3DS gyroscope and they are just as bad as the microphone games. and then there's the story mode, it's probably the worst story I have ever heard in any game ever, what happens is DR eggman and bowser have teamed up and are going to ruin the olympic games by creating heavy fog. my two favorite video game villains finally team up and the best they can come up with is covering the city in fog, that's really sad. then there are evil fog versions of mario and sonic and you have to defeat them all, now how do you defeat them you have to play against them in regular sport events, really? and then after making it to the end of story mode you finally get to Bowser and  DR eggman, instead of an epic final boss fight you just play against them in sports, THIS IS ONE OF SEGA AND NINTENDO'S BIGGEST MISSED OPPORTUNITIES EVER. they could have redeemed the game with one of the best final bosses in any 3DS game, but no. but final verdect is, if you want this game get the wii version, avoid the 3DS version at all costs, the only thing that keeps me from giving it a zero is okay graphics. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yup, that's a 2 rating and after 20 minutes no less; now let me iterate.

So I started in some kind of cavern, no exits and no big deal. I figured there must be a trigger to continue or a way to drill out, something; wasn't seeing it then lo I found some way forward (draw distance sucks).

Than something about a crew member needing to talk(tutorial) cant exit or resolve this after, just locked into the sub 2d mode; then I quit. There are few options and no key mapping which I find to be a good reference for the controls when a game fails in this regard.

The screen to sub point of view is over the right garbage, which was garbage in every game that ever used it. I currently have it modded out for any game I play.

No save option because of a checkpoint system, yeah thats on my list of bad and stupid game design choices because when a save gets corrupted, you must restart; also it is ridiculous .

-cumbersome controls due to bad sprite position
-bad draw distance and onscreen clutter
-no in game reference for commands and no options
-no z axis movement buttons that I can find(needed by any game of this type that uses depth and altitude as movement)

There are improvements that can be beyond its issues as well,; a HUD display with functions could alleviate some issue but in all the game is on the low end to anything else Ive played in a year; It gets a 1 for function, a 4 for effort and a 2 for the game it turned out to be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm so disappointed. This game looked so promising. OK - it has quite good looking 2D art, nice mood, sound design and overall art style. But unresponsive controls, confusing 3D graphics and poor storytelling makes it hard to enjoy.
I'll return to this game in about three months, after all patches, maybe it'll get better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dawnguard isn't all that big, but it adds some much needed gear to the boring Skyrim world. If Skyrim had actually been a decent game then this addon would be worth the money without a doubt. Too bad Skyrim is a poor, shallow game that is neither a good RPG, a good action game or a good adventure game. It tries to be all of that and more but it does everything far below average. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok, so, I eagerly awaited for a decent golf game for the PS4 expecting something really amazing, wow, was I disappointed. Play or don't, very little you can do to customise, no learning curve and the ability to create courses......so what. They should have included more customiseable options rather than the useless boring create a course.
Initially it was a little fun, but after several hours of gameplay I have decided to ask for a refund. Really if you love Tiger Woods then you will probably hate this, if you really love golf sims....then you may get a few hours of enjoyment but this has no longevity, graphics are ok, trees and scenery still loading while you are playing. I have never been so dissapointed in a gem of any knid, over hyped and even at £25+....overpriced........avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is another brutally forgettable PSN title, and an OVERPRICED one at that. PS2 graphics. You could get a copy of any Tiger Woods games for peanuts compared to this game. This game is worse than all the Tiger Woods games. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay first off I want to state that I am a die hard golfer and am way more interested in a golf sim than an arcade style golf game where you shoot 20 under. I couldn't have been more excited about this game leading up to release. That said, I was highly disappointed. Yes this game is hard (which I like) just like real life, but in a bad way.  You can't hit your irons very far... I actually hit my irons much further in real life.  An 8 iron only goes 145 full power in this game.  In real life that is a smooth 9 or a stepped on PW. The rough is over-exaggerated...you basically just have to hack out back into play and there is no such thing as catching a"flyer." The graphics are honestly like PS2 quality. Yes, you read that right PS2, not even PS3 quality. The game is also very glitchy... I hooked a shot in a rocky area on the 2nd hole of a "highly rated" course and I couldn't even see my guy, but could still blindly swing only to have it go about 10 yards and hit more rocks and crash the game to where it completely closes out the game and gives me an error code. Once I reload the game it will let me continue my round exactly where I left off hitting that same blind shot from the rocks only to have the exact same thing happen again. I must have crashed the game at least 6 times in a row before finally giving up and have not played it since. I did manage to play 18 uneventful holes before I played that course, so I have played a total of 19 and 1/2 holes. The only thing cool about this game is the course create, but I actually haven't spent much time on that.  Their is no point creating a cool course if it is not fun to play. I had to laugh at a Xbox One review I read that said "There is no joy in polishing a turd."  That about sums it up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I say this as someone who, while hating 13-1, kinda enjoyed 13-2 and was cautionsly optimistic about 13-3: This game is possibly the worst game in the entire series next to All the Bravest. While technically superior to 13-1, it is staggeringly worse than 13-2. The attempt to make Lightning an even "tougher" character is laughable and she just comes up as some personality-free golem. Toriyama's idol worship is taken to the literal extreme by actually deifying her and the result is pure absurdity that only the most vapid fanboy will buy.  The timer system actively works against the whole hook of the game; being a huge world to explore, by forcing you to carefully plan your travel routes and, above all else, don't waste any time enjoying the scenery.

Outside of NES era cash-ins and its own drunken grandfather in FF13-1, its probably the worst game I've ever pushed myself finish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a huge fan of the Final Fantasy series, I can say, hand on heart, that this was the single most disappointing game I have ever played. BAR NONE. I loathed this game so much that I'm convinced anyone giving this a 10 must have been bribed by Square, because this game is bad. A lot of people wailed on XIII and XIII-2 for being disappointing, which in all fairness they were, but they were still fun games to play and I'd have still rated them at least a 7. Lightning Returns was supposed to be the final game of the Nova Chrysalia series that was supposed to redeem it, but it destroyed it. The story is weak beyond belief, it created more plot holes than it fixed and any questions it answered were without genuine explanation "Just because". The characters all the same ones that were in the last games, including a young Hope (remember "Just because") who was more annoying than Fi and Navi from the Legend of Zelda series combined and ten-fold. The game wasn't long; don't misunderstand me, this is a point in its favour, if I had to play any more of it I'd have gouged out my own eyeballs. The combat however was awful, I just couldn't get the hang of it, which honestly didn't matter because fighting enemies was pointless, aside from earning EP, which after getting 5 you could spend on a single curaga spell to go on and fight more enemies and be a part of a completely pointless and unending cycle. The side quests were garbage and were sadly NOT optional seeing as doing quests was the only way to improve Lightnings stats, because as we've already established fighting enemies and leveling up is apparently not cool any more. The bosses were boring as sin and pretty much all of them were characters from the past games who you are now in a disagreement with.
Honestly I'd have given this game a 0, but it did have one redeeming feature. ONE. The costumes were really nice and offered a wide spectrum of advantages and skills, for what it was worth. That concludes my review, if you actually buy this game after reading this I feel for you, truly I do. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TELL ME WHAT IM SUPPOSED TO BE DOING!!! THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND I CANT FIND WHERE IM SUPPOSED TO GO OR WHAT TO DOOOOOOO!!!!

That was most of my thoughts while playing this game. For the love of all that is holy it was an awesome game and they had to murder it with a half baked time system and overly creepy, religion based, dialogue.

possitives: the battle mechanics are neat, the story is good, i love the open world idea and the atmosphere is creepy yet engaging.

negatives: the aforementioned time system, the lack of direction and lack of some kind of a fast traves system to get through the sprawling confusing maps 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not have to say anything more. But i need to write one hundred and fifty characters. i think my score can describe it............................ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

unable to gain experience, totally fanservice, hybrid control system engages but becomes repetitive, and for fans of this saga, the only positive thing: the big world open for the rest a great disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously, I registered an account only to write a bad review about this game. I would have give it maybe a 6 out of 10, for the nice graphics, nice music, ok battle system, poor story and poor leveling system... but the time limit makes this game absolutely horrible. Yes, I cut 4 whole points to my review for only one feature in the game. I mean, no RPG fans want to have a time limit in a game. I play FF games since the very first title on the NES and one thing I enjoy is taking my time to explore, or just fighting monsters to grind levels, but this game allows none of these.

I always thought that FF13 / FF13-2 were the worst in the entire serie, but I still wanted to believe that something good was coming with LR, but honnestly, this game is total crap. I guess I can lose all hopes for FF15. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game is, just like it's prior games, not worth it. The story is garbage and predictable, the main characters are just boring and annoying (Lightning herself is just plain boring and nothing unique) and the way you have to work your way through the story is just sad. Sometimes, you encounter creatures that are just straight out un-killable, and thats happening on the first day of the story. You know that a game is bad when the first creatures you fight are un-killable.

The game also expects you to have extreme knowledge of where to go and when to do it. I have read the strategy guide, and it tells me to go somewhere that i had no idea of where was and then told me it is extremely important that i do it, or else the rest of the game becomes extremely difficult and again, almost impossible.

I could continue talking bad about it, it does have its upsides in how battle works, which is fun, but nothing special. The customization is also great, but the game is just balls hard if you dont use your days to the maximum. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After having a decent experiance with the first of the next gen sports titles from EA and 2Ksports, I was looking forward to this baseball title. I must say it was complete gargage and I sold it 30 minutes after I bought it. Up until now, I thought buying a 2K sports title was a safe bet. I have been proven wrong. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an ugly port.... Thank God I looked here at the reviews and rented it first. This game is only worth about $20 when it doesn't lock up. However, if you are a Yankees fan - they are for some reason even higher than all the all-star teams on this with perfect stats which doesn't make sense. The stats in the game appear to be very bias and simply pulled from a dev guys backside with pinstripes :). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having the exclusive baseball license should put more resposibility on these guys, but instead they ported the crappy xbox version to xbox 360. Jesus Christ they need a new physics engine, mvp 2003 had better ball physics. The controls are wonky and dont always respond in time. I dislike EA sports like anyone else but please give them back the MLB license. Kush game suck! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only thing more amazing than how bad this game is, is how it ever managed to get released or even got Microsoft approval. I have never, in all my 25 years of gaming been so disappointed with a game. How can you get exclusive rights to a product and then basically fail to even show up? This game has times where you fight with the fielding so much you just want to throw the controller out the window. I was actually surprised that they patched the freezing issue after completely ignoring it on the NHL effort for the 360. I think its safe to say my days of purchasing 2KSports titles are over. Lets al hope Microsoft make an attempt next year with High Heat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This game sucks terribly.  The only good thing about this game is the Stadiums, everything else about this game is rushed and hacked.  I am an absolute baseball fanatic and have always played baseball games non-stop on any system ive ever had and i cannot bring myself to play this game.  The players dont look anythin like themselves, the fielding is soo slow and rocky, i wish i never bought this game and to 2k sports....stop making baseball games and let EA do it right cause ive never been more disappointed in my life about a video game than this one, PLEASE BRING BACK MVP, FOR THE SAKE OF EVERYTHING, MVP 2005 for regular xbox blows away MLB 2k6 for 360, so get rid of these poorly made games cause nobody likes them 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

berserk and the band of the hawk is a dynastysamurai warriors -like game but it's simply a waste of time even for a fan,
I've read the manga, watched the anime and movie, but this game doesn't do it.
it has a decent graphic models which is loyal to the source and the cutscenes are taken from the movies but that's about the only good thing I have to say about this game.

this game fighting style is so simplistic and repetitive, every mission is about the same and by the same I mean - almost the same map, same models , idiotic ai .
to me it feels like there's a template for the game just different models inserted, you could've easily do another game and it all feels the same. bosses such as zodd are laughable in normal difficulty and horseriding is absolutely bad.
it takes you through the story but the only thing that gives you the feeling you're playing it is ONLY the cutscenes, specially when I compare it to the PS2 berserk game, there everything from cutscenes to fights were related and felt like a continuous story, here it simply bored me. I literally forced myself to play the game but couldn't get into it.

there're some obscure decisions in this game like equipment is just for stats but nothing interesting, really reminds me of the old dynasty warriors I've played ages ago but back then it felt fresh but this simply refuse to take off.
you can upgrade your rings and etc but it all feels very cheap and in each and every step of the way it feels like a bad template that berserk models were pour into...
even when you unlock characters and try them it's the same story, mechanic is the same but the moves are different.
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not even a die hard fan(the kind who checks constantly if there's another manga chapter!) would find this game disappointing and boring 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This review has been CENSORED by Metacritic once, i edited it to make it "luss uffunssive, muh feelings", but i'll keep posting it if it gets deleted.

It is pure cash-grab seriously, the game has like 0 depth whatsoever in terms of game-play you are better playing the PS2 game which was WAY better with more game mechanics than this game.

Difficulties are broken all of them, if you play on Berserk the game at first glans seems to be super hard and it is because the game has 0 depth in terms of combat and is just a button mashing game (and not even a good one just smash X and Y...) then they made a mechanic called RAGE, when you press O and get all powerful and mighty YOU CAN'T DIE, you are literally IMMORTAL and here is another thing... that rage meter thing charges ON IT'S OWN once your health is red... so here is how you beat the game on Bersker mode:

Get on red health---> wait for rage--->press O and become immortal ---> hack and slash everyone-->charge "ult"---> press O again in the direction of a multitude of enemies or the boss---> WIN.

There is no "git gud" so don't pretend this game is hard, it isn't, this mechanics just shows how bad this is, people trying to pretend this game is hard and one must "become good" are just lying to themselves, the game combat has no mechanics whatsoever is unresponsive and it's basically done to just spam X and Y and sometimes hit O.

The fact of the matter is that if you put the game on "Hard" it is outright BABY MODE, enemies hit for like .04% of your total health bar... ARE YOU KIDDING ME NOW?, and you know why is that?, because the core of the game, the combat is terrible, it has no depth so the game can't be "balanced" either Baby mode or super hard mode with CHEESE.

Then the "customization" is sooo LAME i mean compared to games like Dragon Quest Heroes this is terrible, no crafting, no item drops, no skills, no leveling up points, no character builds, no world map, no new areas with hidden bosses. All you have is lame accessories and that's it...

They were so lazy that they just outright put the same stuff you already saw in the movies, you are basically seeing the movies again, the cut-scenes are just LAZY rip-offs.

On top of that the game runs poorly and it has many problems with alt-tabbing, crashes and stuff...AND day 1 DLC, trash overpriced costumes.

Anyone, ANYONE that defends this is just a fanboy, PERIOD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am disgusted by this album. I agree with the song "America's Most Hated".. He is truly America's most hated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had hemroids that felt better than the crap I heard coming out of KFED's mouth. Only thing missing from the lyrics, was the lyrics themselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So many things went wrong with this album. First and foremost: Fred Durst still can't write lyrics to save his life. He's 30-something years old and still writes with the mindset of a drunken frat boy. Secondly: The band's best musician, guitarist Wes Borland, is MIA on RESULTS MAY VARY. Mike Smith does an okay job replacing Borland, but it simply isn't the same. Third, like "Chocolate Starfish" before it, the album runs on too long (although not as long as "Chocolate Starfish," where seven tracks out of the eight in the album's second half exceeded five minutes in length). Third: The cover of "Behind Blue Eyes" is the best song on the album. This is a problem for two reasons: a) The instrumental from the original has been replaced by a dull, monotonous voice repeating "L-I-M-P...discover" over and over; and b) If a subpar cover of someone else's song is the best song on your band's album, then you're probably in big trouble because none of your own songs are standing out as much. The only thing that could have made this album any worse is if they stuck with their original idea for the album title and called this record -- I kid you not -- PANTY SNIFFER. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album has some okay songs but overall this is a truly dreadful album. There is a reason whilst many people don't like Limp Bizkit and this is exactly why a mess of an album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could just say what I did about their last album, but I'm not going to. Wes Borland isn't even remotely present on this album and the musicianship is dreadfully dull. The lyrics are surprisingly worse than they were before due to Fred Durst and his "zanny" acts and stupidity and it doesn't help that the lyrics are irrelevant. I'll give the first two albums some kind of credit (not much but some), but here its just shocking. Truly a testament to how bad nu metal is and its demise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Limp are has-beens. The album is consistantly weak and is nothing new. How many tracks are on the CD? It doesn't matter, you'll keeping skipping every track until it's over anyway. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is mediocre is only crap. 1.- The music is crap, only metal guitar whitout emoution or line whit the song, bateri and bass are mediocre, no innovate and is the same like other mediocre neo-punk band like God Charlote or neo metal like Linkin Park (Linkin Park Ultimete album is more best than this crap). Well the music no have style and nothin to say... checkout the music of The Smith... the instrument are alive. 2-. The Lyric and the concep of the album is junt crap the lyric of sad song are like "Fuck you Fuck you i'm so sad Madafuker in the dark" is all SHIT... Look the lyrics of Morrissey or The Stroke or AFI or or the crap of Evanencence the early albums of metalica. The albums of Nsync or Britney are best than this crap they are better pop than Limp Bizkit are. Limp Bizquit= Bad Pop whit Mediocre Rock Pretending darknes. Somebody tell Fred "PLEASE SHUT YOUR HEAD AND NEVER DO A ALBUM AGAIN" THE PEOPLE WHO LISEN LIMP BISKIT ARE IDIOT SKATE WANNABE WHO PRETENDING LISEN MUSIC AND NITHER KNOW HOW ARE VELVET UNDERGROUND. YEA RIGH THE "ANTI-POP" WHEN THEY ARE POP... BUT CRAP BOB... MORE CRAP THAN BSB 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know what happened, they never been the best but not that bad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a joke, surely? Also, I don't hate the album just because of critical reception, I've heard the album. Imagine if Oasis's first album was Standing on the shoulders of giants and their albums went downhill in the same way, well this is what their 4th album would be like. A pointless attempt at invoking some feeling of nostalgia. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the f....!! You know, if I want to listen to pop-rock I'll play U2 or Coldplay, at least that's what those guys are good and known for. But what in the name of god is this? Where's that groovy house beat; the cool laid-back synthesizers; the awesome bass line? There's nothing here but an attempt to be like everybody: dull, plastic, monotonous, and not a sign of life...not one sign of the Dirty Vegas I once knew. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Don't give it a zero. 'Drop The World' and the intro to 'Runnin' were kinda good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only redeeming factor might be "Drop The World" - and thats the only reason I give a '2.' This album is horrible and honestly the worst album I have heard in some time.  Wayne is SOOOO Much better than this crappy effort. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For once I agree with the critics. usually they under rate good products & movies like Bad Santa, Jawanna Man, & Diary of a mad BLK women but this time they hit the nail right on the Head. Every snce he adopted Autotunme Lil Wayne has been mediocre but now hes just plain Wack with Lame immature lyrics & lyrical delivery & disposable music. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wasn't impressed with this album at all. I loves some of his earlier work, but I just could not get in to this album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im a Lil Wayne fan and I always like when artists try something else but rock clearly doesnt suit Lil Wayne, but at least he tried and I dont blame him for that but it failed. Drop the World saved the album from zero. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Every song on this album is worse than See You Again and that's a **** accomplishment. I mean you have to be on another level of **** to be able to do that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute dredge. This album just plods, and plods, and plods along. The most exciting segment is when Selena Gomez shows up for a sleepy cameo. This really could have used a shot in the arm and more than just two uptempo tracks. 'Left Right Left' might be some of the most pedestrian writing I've ever heard. A few of these tracks would work better if they weren't surrounded by 7 other tracks that sound identical to it.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Chorus.
Repeating words, loops of chords.
And all of the lyrics is just about the lame things. Very monotonous and basic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What puts me off is that if this was sung by Ed Sheeran, Justin Timberlake, and possibly even the Chainsmokers, it wouldn't be a bad album.  But it is.  Puth had the *well-thought out* idea to produce his debut album by himself.  That's a stupid thing to do, even for a pop artist.  Instrumentally, the songs are bland.  You can SENSE the emptiness of the guitars and bass.  And don't get me started on lyrics.  Puth has just shown that he's trying way too hard to be like Mariah Carey or Michael Jackson, and failing, singing about past relationships and being a "hero." [False ego.]  As for his voice, it's so whimpery and whiny that it sounds like he's going through puberty again.
I enjoyed See You Again as much as anyone.  But every other song by Puth just slowly turns him into the 16 year old Justin Bieber (The one we all hated).  He lacks charisma, talent, and emotion, and his solace for all that is just fake.
It could be worse, though.  Still, I hate this album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely awful. After the remarkably brilliant tone of their first album, this feels forced, disingenuous and completely flat. One or 2 songs almost catch your ear but this band has either sold out, or traded their bravado for estrogen pills *yack*. Stop trying to change with the times and do what you are good at... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a great way to celebrate Kurt's 10th anniversary suicide than throw in this Puddle of Dudd cd. After a few beers and a joint, nobody'd be able to tell the difference. A+ for originality all the way 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the most boring album I have listened to ever. The songs lack any spirit or honesty. It is simply that exudes fakeness. The only reason it doesn't warrant getting a 0 or 1 is because the one exception to the album, 'Don't Wake Me Up.' Maybe Chris Brown should try to develop his music instead of focusing on forging passionless 'futuristic' trash like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Chris, you're a dope artiste and performer.. but you need to work harder!! dis album was weak and a poor effort and i'm a big fan but you need to work harder to provide better quality music and i know dat u can do much much better!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not even worth a buy on iTunes. Another generic and disappointing Chris Brown album. All songs are below average except for one: 'Don't Wake Me Up'  which has been produced beautifully but ruined by autotune. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Generic, forgettable, excessive auto-tune. Chris Brown needs to step it up. This is really mediocre, his live voice doesn't help, the contrast with the 90% from his performances which are lip synched is cringe worthy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who has purchased all of Chris Brown's previous albums I was highly disappointed. This sounds like an album of leftover mix tapes tracks. Absolute garbage & embarrassing to his catalogue of music. Give us time to miss you Chris, because this was rushed pop garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just autotuned to trash. Could be decent if he did not overuse the autotune feature. Not a good song on the album. Would be a waste of money to buy, so save your money and stay away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The computer and the editors running it deserve much more credit than Brown does. But, even with the overused technology, Fortune still blows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a very boring Channel!!! It is not easy to explain that 50% lets say 75% of Jane's Addiction is in this band... Because this Channel sounds like utter CRAP. I can't beleive the bandmembers themselves seriously thinks that only one of these songs is great.... Sorry for Dave and Steven to throw away their special talents on this, I hope, One MISTAKE. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this cd is really bad. it shows what happens when you dumb down stephen perkins part and audition a chris cornell wannabe 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not terrible. But fails to make you feel ANYTHING, which can be worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The album just isn't strong. Aside from a few notable tracks such as I Can Transform Ya and Pass Out, much of the album is just dance heavy or electronic ballad driven filler. My how the mighty have fallen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad, annoying, generic and forgettable. "Crawl" and "I.Y.A." are the only good songs here. The rest is mostly garbage. Some other songs (like "So Cold") are still a bit enjoyable. But overall this so so bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of Chris Brown album that I will never understand, I think it should have been only released as an EP with the best from this album, and still I don't how much solid this could end up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why did anyone ever care? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why did I listen to this utter drivel? It intrigues me that people give Alanis any credit for anything at all - ever - given that fantastic artists such as PJ Harvey and Kim Gordon, let alone Marianne Faithful, were doing everything this whinger tries to do but does not even come close to doing. All of her albums are crap and boring, and now she's added a new one to her list. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to admit I was never a fan of the original version, judging it a bit too whiny and adolescent for my taste. But the remake takes inferior material and makes it completely colorless. I usually like acoustic treatments, but in this case run, run, run as fast as you can. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ...aaaaaah 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some people need to cut their losses and move on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Almost totally devoid of charm or substance. The best thing about this version of Jagged Little Pill is that it makes me want to listen to the original. I think the term is "creatively bankrupt" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's just sad that Liz feels she needs to make a bid for commercial acceptance. I dug her written response to the NY Times critique of "Liz Phair" -- she's still a perceptive, clever woman with a lot to say; it's just that this album is ridiculous. She don't need no stinkin' Matrix. Get back, Liz. (and "H.W.C."? She's ridiculing her own propensity for honestly talking about desire, which was one of the freshest things about "Exile in Guyville") 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There has never been a CD more destined for the $2 Used for-sale rack. What a complete disaster...Its like Pearl Jam or Fugazi teaming up with Backstreet Boys. It was too funny reading the moron who wrote that this was the next Ok Computer. High Comedy for sure! Liz needs to take a page out of Pavement's history and see that if people aren't digging your stuff, its better to quit than to sell(out) this slop. HWC for sure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While changing her style from her first album through whitechocolatespaceegg, Liz retained her depth, and there was a kind of emotional arc to it all. I feel like this is Invasion of the Body Snatchers type stuff, because it seems like this isn't really Liz Phair at all. The tragedy for me is that it makes me enjoy her past work less because this new one is just so bad. Maybe if she'd released only the Michael Penn produced tracks, she could have had a pretty interesting EP. Oh well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is nothing breathtaking or groundbreaking about house music anymore. There was nothing breathtaking or groundbreaking about house music 7 years ago, either. Comparing this record to "Kid A" is like comparing apples and rotten apples. If you're over the age of 25 and you're still listening to paul oakenfold records, its time to stop spending so much money on hair gel and move out of your moms house. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too lively for me, apparently. I don't know if Oakenfold developed an immunity to sharp treble. I don't know if he's got an immunity to taste in music. If he's got an immunity to making LYRICS in songs sound good... But he lacks so much stuff that making an album called "A Lively Mind" just makes it sound like a selling catchline. The album's real name being hidden somewhere within there. Possibly Oak, as to image the single-minded roads the songs take, save for Save the last Trance, which is half-decent. That doesn't solve anything, however. The opening track featuring the girl who Eminem screwed, then Ashton Kutcher, then whoever else... Was good on the first listen, then when I listened to it again, I found it stale and repetitive. Following songs just got irritating to the ear. Imagine being subjected to the droplet torture: Sitting down, unable to move, and there's a droplet of water falling down on your forehead constantly, without halt. Within the hour, you go MAD as every single droplet seems to hurt more than the other. This is what happens with this album, as each track sounds more painful than the other. And then Paul adds to the mayhem by saying something in one of his tracks. Well, saying something... He's looping saying something, which doesn't mean anything, because it's kind of like two robots unable to make a connection, constantly asking "What's up?": "Whassup Paul?" - "Hey Flash, Whassup?" I don't know if that's meant to show how LIVELY MINDED Paul is, but if that's the case, he fails pretty fucking hard. That, or the song was supposed to have full-time singing and ended up having none. I could go on but frankly, in a few words: Bad album, bad artist, bad mind. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is easily Enya's least inspiring album thus far. Its more of the same with the good highlights taken out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A really drowsy album. Nothing really happening here but a few attempts at radio-friendliness. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Enya's early work is a matrix of relaxation infused with startling intelligence. This album is proof that her relaxation craft remains intact while her intelligence continues to wane. There is increasingly less to discover in her successive outings. She seems like an Alzheimers patient who annoyingly forgets what she's already done. A message and a feeling is not necessarily conveyed by a tune that sounds like an earlier tune that had a message and a feeling. Her music remains pleasant, but nonetheless is simply chewing gum for the ears, in diminishing flavors. If you want to know what her next 14 albums will sound like, listen to this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. So you shouldn't give something bad reviews because you don't like it? You should just let it go away? What if I said, "Hey, because you don't like it, you shouldn't be telling us that, you should be listening to it." This is a REVIEW. People hate your band. Musically, this album is pathetic. I've seen better offerings from the emo garage band next door, and I'm being completely and totally serious. Boring. Nu-Metal is dead, try listening to real metal: Lamb of God, Opeth, Dream Theater. That should be enough for anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It just leaves me somewhat upset when I read these posts. Not only do people actually relate to this and allow it to help them, they qualify this music and the overlaboured lyrics that comes with it as "incredible". Amazing. Or maybe not... Staind get their money from untried individuals who have little sense of musical background, human culture in the whole, and whose concepts of sensitivity and release correspond to a different tone of voice under a blunt distortion. It should be much too little. This, mind you, is not a good rock album. What is this in front of source tags & codes? I won't bother listing others. Critics are not geeky figures behind desktops playing eclectic, and if they were it wouldn't undermine their opinion. My only hope in this matter (if I have one) is that one day some of you actually realise the smallness of this piece of sound in what has been done in our time. In the meantime, you'll be staring at the blankest and dulles of walls (and maybe paying for it) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Josh C., I really hope you were being sarcastic there because that was the most over-the-top insane thing I have ever read on this website. As for everyone else, well, if you prefer your music to be bland, homogeneous and full of fake sentimentality then this is your thing. Everyone else who desires hard rock can listen to a hard rock band with actual talent, like Queens of the Stone Age. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remember listening to this album back in 2001. And again when they rereleased in 2003. Etc. Nickelback is good at making catchy song, that's it. I didn't put a plural on song because they've recycled it over and over again. Also, Josh C, you are a great troll. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best Nickelback album is around a 5.5 out of 10. This one is a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok i have listened to the first 4 nickelband albums and they were good. So i thought id give this album a try and how i regret it so. First off everyone needs to relize one thing. CHAD CANT SING! Honestly and Photogragh sounded like a warped version of someday. There is not even one song on this album that stands out. Even the bands chad krouger helps have made better albums then his band this year. Aka Default, Theory Of A Dead man. Way better albums. I dont see a reason how these guys are still around a complete and utterly bland album. Check Out the new Default Album it's 10X better then this pos of an album 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They rewrote the album for the 3rd time. and god this band was decent back in when they made the State. Everything since Silver side up is derirvative. Example: how you remind me- someday- save me are essentially the same song. This time they just added softer songs compared to their last couple of cds. Besides, they were not original in the first pkace. I agree with the guy a few reviewers below me that they had to sing about drugs, wild sex(animals), being a rockstar(rockstar the song itself the same as the last song from the last record See you at the Show). In other words, there are much better bands out there...check out wolfmother, new pearl jam, well most stuff is better than nickelback. However, nickelback is not bad as those emo, r&b, and alot of mainstream rap which saves them from a 0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this a number 2 becasue their music sounds like "number 2". This is the same boring god-awful, manufactured, contrived, and overly produced crap I always hear on the radio. Why is this band labled "alternative"? An alternative to what? It sounds like every other "corporate rock" crap that is played on the radio. The lead singer sings like he's taking a dump and all the songs sound the same. This band is lacking in originality and creativity. There are so many other great artists on smaller independent lables ... It's a pitty they don't get the airplay they deserve. Anyway, I just wonder how much money these huge record companies are paying these radio stations to play their shit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nickelback is just what's wrong with popular rock...or popular music in general. For them and their peers, it's all about sounding big and tough. Heavy guitars, gravelly vocals x10. But it's all the same stylistic nonsense that bands have been doing since Nirvana split. Equally dismal is the fact that their teenage fans can do nothing to defend them except hurl curses and death threats at negative reviewers. I used to be that young, and I used to think that that "jock-rock" would make me cool if I listened to it. Then I got older, and I realized it was all calculated major-label radio trash. You kids should get back to us in 10 years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most people who like this album are already just fans of the band, and not neccasarily music, this album is nothing more than rock n roll cliche made into songs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Apparently Nickelback have taken the "Recycle" campaigns to heart, as every Nickelback song sounds (mostly) the same. They harmonize and junk the same way. Too bad its all boring and generic! Notice all the good reviews. What do they say? "Your just jelous!" or "They sold more!" Well, if selling records makes an album good, then MC Hammer isn't just a rip-off, he has TALENT! Seriously, folks, lets be realistic, what has Nickelback done to expand post-grunge? For that matter, what is the difference between Creed and Nickelback? Oh, right, Chad Kroeger can't sing. (Don't believe me? Listen to "If everyone cared"...if your ears ain't bleeding from the cheesy climax of the song, you obviously haven't heard much music). Chad Kroeger has an incredibly grating voice, and he writes cliched lyrics. At times, it sounds like if it took him 1 minute to write the whole lyrics of the album (if everyone lied/nobody would die, psh, easy rhyme!). Nothing in this album is original, and really, when not proudly waving the banner of generic, they tap dance their way into "cheesy" territory. Ballads, suck! And care to tell me the difference between this and their previous album? Didn't think so. All in all, this is very much representative of horrible radio rock. Think of it as the time in Rock History where all those crappy Arena Rock bands began to appear (no not Def Leppard, I'm talking about the ones who shamelessly copied them). Sure, they sold a lot, but no one will care about them in a few years. Nickelback, you suck. You are generic, safe. And in case you don't believe me that this album was just made to sell, Kroeger himself admitted it. "We are on autopilot." Too bad your fans want you to crash into the spot of "Worst, Generic, Cheesiest band ever". But never fear, Hinder is already there! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Why don't you keep you're (sic) opinion to your self if you aren't a fan" ... what?! I'm a fan of the rock genre, isn't that enough? And as for Zach "how can you give this album a zero and try to justify your reasons" M... fair question, it's not an offensively godawful album - they've at least honed what they do pretty well, as you blindly loyal fans can attest - but how can YOU give it a ten? Is it honestly one of the best things you've ever heard? Nickelback are middle of the road. Fives out of tens are in their souls. It's a cheap thrill, not innovative or new. Hero H might be right in saying it's a "greast ablum" but I don't know what that means. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Uncreative, too soft and boring. But....is there really a need for so much hostility? Ok, it's crap...but there SOO much worse music around... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Went to the bargain bucket yesterday and bought this album out of curiosity for 5 cents. Got it home and heard the dull, meaningless songs and shoiuted I WANT MY NICKELBACK hahahahaha, no seriously this is a pretty damn dull record 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just like in the late, late 80's when Wingers and Warrants led an army of bands that caused the demise of Rock N Roll, here we have Nickelback and say, Hinder to start it all over again. Cheesy balladry and mindnumbing overplay. The 80's ended when Nirvana came around. I hope this crap ends soon when another one emerges. This album is disposable and the only reason I like it is because it serves well as a beer coaster. I'm giving them a 2 for the Dimebag reference, but the poor guy is probably rolling in his grave right now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

HAHA! Young-MC or Hammer would crush this guy!! That's the true rap...that's the stuff that matters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I must say, the repetitive content on this album and the ratings are just the tip of the iceberg for the musically universal eradication of "crap music." (No Pun intended) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry but this is not the old Queen we are used to hear. Rodger's voice doesn't fit with the old songs, and to make him kind of be useful to the (new) band they had to try something different, and it didn't work. It sounds more like a bad Bad Company album than anything Queen ever did, even the worst stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can I say "OLD"? oh, wait...er...Can I say "TOO AMERICAN"? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible..... This is the man that samg Jesus Christ Pose for gods sake. I have a very open mind and was interested in hearing the collaboration between Cornell and Timbaland but i should of known better that the disaster that was Carry On. Please Chris make a choice either go back to Soundgarden or just stop already. You are better than this rubbish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is so annoying that you'd find yourself humming the title track while having a bath and then slip and fall in shock and say "Damn You to hell Cornell!!!" However if you like the stuff One Republic came up with you'd like this.... He must be in his mid-life crisis or something...I dunno...go figure! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as I love Cornell, this album is just unfortunate. It's not really even a Cornell album: it's a Timbaland album with Cornell on vocals. The Metacritic rating of 47 is generous and the only reason that I gave this album a generous 2 is because of "Two Drink Minumum". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your column states that this CD is by New Found Glory...oops! It's Chris Cornell. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I shouldn't even give this a 2! This is the worst thing either one of them has done. Chris Cornell has always been one of my favorite singers. If this is how he wants to waste his career, I think its time to hang it up. Yes, this is a new direction, but its a sad attempt at something that didn't have to be this bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really cannot believe how horrible this album is. I was hoping that maybe Timbaland wouldn't screw it up (like the 2 songs he produced for Bjork that were pretty good) but ultimately it sounds like Timbaland took Chris by his balls and did his best to fit his vocals to Justin Timberlake instrumentation. I hope Mr. Cornell gets his act together-- another one like this, and I'm just giving up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Chris Cornell is a great artist, but really missed the mark with this one. I can't get 'Long Gone' out of my head, which is the only reason I gave this album a 2 instead of a 0. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Might not have been as bad if he have of called Trent Reznor, but this is just weird. What you imagine a dickish Hollywood friend of Paris Hilton would come up with if they made a record. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think I'm being generous. Watch out for high reviews from the females, they're on the payroll. Well, they would be if they were actually getting paid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is the musical equivalent of watching grass grow. Perhaps Lenny should stop diddling movie stars, and try writing some decent songs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lenny's worst recording. And why the hell did he invite Jay-Z for another boring song? Jay-Z means so much more than ''storm''... Dump out this album. Yuck. A real mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lenny's 2nd straight subpar album... at one time I thought each new record pushed in a different direction but this is retreaded stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album sucks, i would bang her though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That's the most stupid name i hever heard (i am me). need more reasons? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the only thing notably good about this album is her boobs on the cover.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Memories: Do Not Open is terrible. Just straight up garbage. This is not even music. The Chainsmokers, first of all I have a huge problem with them because they obviously target young people with their style of music, but their name clearly promotes cigarette smoking. After so many years of trying to make smoking seem uncool and unappealing, these irresponsible hooligans come along with their electric pop dance songs and are sending the message that cool hip youngsters should chain smoke cigarettes! Now teenagers are going to be hanging out with their squads lighting up a Lucky Strike and grooving to the vibes of the top 100 chart techno songs by the ChainSMOKERS when they're partying it up with their baes on the dance floor. Just unacceptable that this passes for music. These lazy, talentless bums don't even play any musical instruments! They make all the songs on their iPad laptops. Millenialls are killing music, and they're killing themselves with tobacco. Shameful. Worst generation ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. The Chainsmokers had some good singles from 'Don't Let Me Down' to 'Closer' to 'Paris'. I honestly expected this album to be one of the good ones. Maybe the first album since Guetta's 'Nothing But The Beat' to successfully mix EDM and mainstream music. Boy, was I wrong. This album is hot trash. Every song sounds the same, but each worse than the other. Somehow, even 'Paris' ends up sounding bad when listening to the album. These guys should just keep releasing singles and stay away from albums, cos obviously, they don't know what they're doing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Closer and Roses plainly among those songs are remixes in each one tracks, they let us down so far, Only a few are salvageable from amid too much garbage as Something just like this and Don't let me down as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You scrapped Closer, Don't Let Me Down and All We Know for this crap. Seriously.

Best Song(s):
Paris

Worst Song(s):
Something Just Like This
Break Up Every Night
It Won't Kill Ya
The One
Honest
Young
Wake Up Alone 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the album is just the same rhythm in each song , it just saves Young and Paris, the can't say they are better than Lady Gaga, and this album prove it . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They shouldn't have labelled this album as dance/electronic. It is a pop album, and none of the songs is a real EDM. And please don't ruin other singers next time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Something Just Like This" is the only bearable song on the whole album. It is very bland and boring throughout the whole project. It's a definite pass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

LMFAO, score 1.4. I love happy endings
This album is so dumb and superficial I can't even believe this. Yikes. I'm really laughing back at when the main singer said that they were going to be the singers of the millenium or something, I don't remember. Sad hahaha. They're over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

huge disappointment! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a dissapointment... Steve Albini should be hung... 1 near great song "My Idea of Fun" and a bunch of junk... I will still go see the live show but I hope they keep away from most of this stuff Please boys .. on the next one get Deniz Tek or James Williamson to produce.. Iggy I am sorry but once again you have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. In closing...The Weirdness is a sad effort not worth your hard earned money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They shouldn't have made it. Why men in their intellectual prime who can paint, theorize, and write better than at any other point in their lives cannot also create the best sonic racket of their careers is beyond me. Youthcentricism is extremely ugly, and I, in no way, value youth more than sagacity - quite the opposite, really. That being said, it seems a band like The Stooges could only do what they did TRULY effectively for a very short time. And they needed to be young & dumb to do it. A band like Radiohead can and will still create great music at age 65 because their music is of a cerebral, not visceral nature. Not so for the Iggy & the Stooges. Their music is meant to be FELT, it is the sort of music that caters to your emotional, not thinking, brain. While still a tremendous live performer at 60+, the bilious verbal gift and inane bravado that Iggy once possessed have given way to something more serene on record, and he should embrace it, not put it on steroids to recapture something irretrievable. Be the noble sage, Iggy. The testing of physical limits is the milieu of youth. Expand your mental horizons, instead. AWFUL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh...gosh, what do i say. This album is really quite...bad. Only good songs for me are Keep Your Hands Off and The River. 2 stars for 2 songs 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is really good, but an elitist attitude towards certain types of music will blind you from realizing that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

gross 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Makes a decent drink coaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

unorganized and unprofessional. very raw, and the songs aren't there. an amateur effort at best 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Never been a fan of Ms. Lopez. I speak Spanish and liked the sound of Qué Hiciste, but the rest of this album, like her others, was extremely disappointing. It is one boring ballad with bad singing after another. I also like Te Voy a Querer, or I would if someone else was singing it. I know it's gotten mixed reviews, but those who like it need to dig deeper. It's just bad. Period. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I admit I've never been a big fan of J-Lo's music, so here I thought if she was ever going to win me over it would be with a Spanish language album. Unfortunately, it just didn't hold my interest. I'll stick to watching her on the big screen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

8 is a plain and uninspiring album that will be forgotten in a year. Its kind of sad to see this happen. They don't bring anything new to the table and don't capitalize on any stylistic details they've used before. Really, this is just a boring snoozefest. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Santana will never be the same after he starting having pop stars trail his band. Their old stuff is 50000x better than what it has been lately. There's no energy anymore, and all the actual Santana can get out of this is a 10 second solo each song. SOOO Lame IMO. And what the hell is up with Santana doing R&B? He needs to retire while he's ahead, and while he can still be considered a good artist. The only reason he's getting a few 10s is because the people that gave 10s have never heard what he used to be like. There wasn't Steven Tyler or Mary J. Blige or anything like that. Whatever happened to the pure originality that was once Santana??? It's gone. Maybe if he made another album of just his band, I will like him again. But the pop has to go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2 is generous. You call this hip-hop? Yo, Ja! Give me my 14 dollars back! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

J.Lo edhe një herë nuk arrin të bëjë një album mbresëlënëse për kritikët apo tifozëve , me përjashtim të perlë " Dashuria e parë " Unë nuk do të gjeni asgjë të mirë duke filluar nga baladat paarsyeshme dhe boatloads e artistëve duke shfaqur me mezi ndonjë rrjedhës të mbajë ato me . Jenny , unë mendoj se kjo është koha juaj për të lënë industrinë e muzikës për të mirë ! 2/10 :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Es Bueno, pero no tiene calidad, los ritmos son sosos, muchas colaboraciones innecesarias, canciones aburridas, y ademas un fracaso comercial... Hay JLo Hay que mejorar 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

From a band who I've enjoyed thoroughly thanks to some catchy songs, this album left me wondering.....I just can't get into these new songs at all. Fans of commercial rock I think will enjoy it, but I can't get into it at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lulu has two alright songs on it, the songs that are alright are "Iced Honey" and "Cheat on Me" the rest of the album is just **** The lyrics for the album are just rubbish, such as, in the song "Frustration" Lou says some like "Kiss your breast and toes" what **** idiot would say that? The man is a wanker and Metallica are dick heads for working with him! What ever you do, don't waste your money on this bull****, buy something better. But i do recommend listening to the album on youtube for a laugh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why Mettalica? One of the greatest bands of all time falls into the greasy hands of the old geaser Lou Reed. He talks, not sings, and you would not be able to tell this was Mettalica. For the die hard fans, my heart goes out to you, haha. But really, everything is garbage, I respect a change from the hard rocking band, but I did expect a change that was higher in quality than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While I can understand what Metallica and Lou Reed tried to do on this record, their sounds are too different to fit well together. This album sounds like Lou Reed reciting dark, and unappealing poems that he had written, while Metallica can be heard jamming in the background and it ends up sounding like a mess. I gave this album several chances to grow on me but it truly is a waste of time and a poor collaboration between very accomplished musicians. The only thing keeping this from a 1/10 is "Iced Honey", which is actually more or less listenable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When The View was released I hoped it was the worst song of the album. It was horrible listening to such a lament (and the lyrics? I am the table? Who the hell wrote that?). But listening to the whole album was also worse. Little Dog is one of the worst songs I have ever listened to. It seems that Lou Reed had stomachache while "singing". Awful. I hope Metallica's 2013 record will be great, so I will forget this album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I dont know what to say of this album. Lou Reed and Metallica, separately, are both awesome. But this album left me confused. The music is without doubt very good. But the singing part (or the speaking part actually) is what i dont get. It confuses me.. Creeps Me out. I tried to expand my taste in music and hear this album but its not what i want! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I laughed at times. Specifically at Reed's vocal efforts. He sounds like a confused old man without any muscial abilities.Summary: Metallica wasted riffs on this album. Lou Reed's poetry would be better off in text form. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, Lulu is so bad that there really isn't much I can say about it. There is virtually nothing on the album worth listening to, with the very best offering sitting well below St. Anger's worst. The poetry is awful and doesn't fit with the music, nor does Lou Reeds droning voice chatting away above recycled garbage riffs. The high points are, predictably, where Lou Reed shuts his trap for two whole seconds for James Hetfield to shout out something irrevocably stupid like "I AM THE TABLE". If I had to say something positive about Lulu, it would be that the production was an improvement from Death Magnetic. Then again, it'd be very difficult for it not to be given how horrendous the production on Death Magnetic was. There isn't a single positive thing I can say about the song writing here. It's all awful beyond any belief, and there isn't a single song worth listening to here. If I had to pick one song, I'd pick The View, if only because Metallica's parts are slightly more frequent on this song, and all of the inanimate objects James Hetfield insists he is in the latter half of the song. Final verdict? Avoid this album like the god damn plague. Do NOT waste your money on this. Do not even ENCOURAGE this kind of behavior from musicians like Metallica. Dig a grave, bury this album alongside the now very dead Lou Reed (do you think Lulu was so bad it killed him?) and pretend this atrocity never existed in the first place - and maybe, just maybe, Metallica can salvage their reputation on their next non-collaborative effort. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You know how there are a number of films such as The Room, Birdemic and Troll 2 that are infamous for being "so bad they're good"? Well this piece of work right here is quite possibly the musical equivalent of any of those films. There may not be as much ironic enjoyment to be found here as those films, but there are unintentionally funny moments, particularly in the lyrics, and "I am the table!" is as widely quoted in the metal community as "You're tearing me apart, Lisa!" is in the best-worst movie community. That humour is what stops the album from being rated a flat out 1.

This project would have served better had Metallica not played on or slapped their name on it. Had it simply been a "Lou Reed" album, it would have sounded better musically and would have been enjoyed thoroughly by his fans. Metalica, on the other hand, need to learn when to say "no" if a collaboration is quite obviously not going to work. Maybe they're getting a little too much of the blame though, considering they didn't write the lyrics or compose all the music; they mostly serve as a backing band with some backup vocals here and there from James Hetfield which sound completely out of place with Reed.

If you're more into Metallica than Lou Reed you will not be able to take this seriously. Maybe save it for a drunken night where you're walking best-worst films and need some suitable background music in between the films.

A long time Linkin Park fan (aren't we all) checking in. Allow me to begin my experience with One More Light in full by going back a few records. Hybrid Theory was the first CD I ever purchased and holds a special place in my heart. Since that record, I have enjoyed every effort LP has released. I listen to all their works from beginning to end and easily can get lost in the simple, catchy music LP is known to put out. Their music just flat out rocks. Even when it comes to their softer every fforts, my heart is in it 100%. Fast forward to early 2017 and the song Heavy is released for fans to praise or rage about. I praised Heavy and even the later released Battle Symphony. LP stuck to their arena rock sound and put some pop flavor in it that went down very well in my opinion so I was still looking forward to One More Light. When the album was finally released, I was disappointed in all the other tracks. The album was drowned in all the post production horrors that make most of the modern day pop music unenjoyable for me. LP lost their crunch and lost their minds. I see that their heart was in the music and they don't want to put out the same music each and every time. I can respect that; they have plenary of music in their catalogue that I can enjoy until the day I die. I won't be revisiting One More Light any time soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I waited for a month or so to listen to this album. There was feeling inside of me that this album would not only be more of a miss than a hit for Linkin Park, but would finally show a fundamental shift not only in genre, but in their distinct style of music. Unfortunately, I was even more correct than I feared.

During their musical journey from nu metal to alternative rock, and even in their single-album foray into electronic rock, Linkin Park has maintained a sound style that was, if not unique, a staple of the band since their foray from Nu Metal. The use of abstract background sounds, powerful piano melodies and guitar riffs, and, most importantly, experimental and consistently changing vocals, created a sound that allowed for change and shifts in musical direction - and kept its fans coming back even to albums that strayed from its rock beginnings.

This style changed drastically with 'One More Light'. The powerful guitar riffs and electronic melodies are gone, along with a lot of the drums. The broad range of vocals seen in previous albums are replaced by a consistent, light vocals with none of the heaviness and emotion seen in albums such as 'Minutes to Midnight', 'The Hunting Party', or 'Living Things'. This creates an album that is mostly without vocal variety between songs. While other albums had heavy and light, as well as fast and slow tracks, this one has solely light and slow tracks. And it has an effect - I honestly could not tell in the first few songs that I had moved onto a new song.

Other reviews had called out Linkin Park for turning decisively into a pop band in this album. I agree, but I think the album is not a boring, forgettable album because of that reason. It is because Linkin Park could not bring any of their old experimentality and unique style to the album. It is not that Linkin  Park cannot make a good pop song - “Shadow of the Day”, I would argue, is a pop song, but the powerful vocals, well developed guitar riff, as well as good musical mixing, create a song that is distinctly Linkin Park - but has mass appeal. In this album, however, Linkin Park brought none of their old experimental spirit, which leads to the album sounding like anything else on the popular music scene right now. This lack of experimentality from the normal is highlighted by their handling of collaboration with other musicians in the album. While in other albums, the collaboration with artists of different styles (such as with Rakim in ‘Guilty All the Same’), or with Jay Z, led to a merging of musical genres that, in my opinion, furthered the genre as a whole, their collaboration with artists in ‘One More Light’, such as in ‘’ has little effect on the song. If the song already sounds like something the artist would make, what’s the point of having a collaboration anyway?

But the sad truth is I think that, underneath the flat melodies and similar-sounding tracks, there really was a foundation that could have been turned into something more than a forgettable album. The song ‘One More Light’ felt like it should have been developed from a light song into a hard-hitting guitar riff and chorus halfway through, but instead kept the same quiet tone throughout. ‘Talking to Myself’ was the opposite - it had a more interesting instrumental part, but was held back by lacking lyrics. ‘Good Goodbye’ felt far too repetitive, but had generally decent vocals.

In ‘One More Light’, Linkin Park not only left behind its distinct style. It also left behind its individuality. And that may be the sad legacy of this album, if the band does not change course after this disappointing album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely terrible album. Added it to my iPhone through Apple Music to stream in the car on the way to work. Didn't even make it past song 3 before I deleted the album in quiet disgust. The trite lyrics were what got to me the most (feels like they were written by a overly dramatic twenty-something year old and not what I expect from  guys into their early forties). Also, even by pop standards, this is a piss poor attempt.

Time to go back to the drawing boards fellas or hang-up the mike and put away the guitars and drum set and retire before you make complete fools out of yourself (although I think with this album the damage is already done). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing, especially after a solid record like The Hunting Party. While I'm relatively open minded to musicians experimenting with different sounds and musical styles, LP's foray into a more mainstream pop soundscape only manages to come off as forgettable, awkward, and at times unbearably bad. The songs on this record lack character and personality, and there's nothing minacious or edgy about this record, qualities that seemed omnipresent in the band's catalogue. Hopefully they can recover from this misstep, ASAP. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've waited until the release to analyse and judge the album with a neutral look on it. And i have to say that is really a shame that Linkin Park decided to tarnish their discography with such a weak album.

You can't even notice any trace of real instruments being played on the record. Mike and Chester dominated the production of the album and led the group toward a complete pop direction.

With electronic beats taking over the guitarist space, short lenghted songs and even multiple featured guests, Linkin Park clearly shows their intentions with a Radio friendly album that was made to sell-out.

The only radical change made by the band was to give a middle finger to their oldshool fans that made them successful in the first place. They didn't wanted another Hybrid Theory like the group likes to insist. They wanted an original album with a Heavy sound that only them could make.

You would think that they were walking toward the right direction with the release of The Hunting Party, but in reality all they wanted to be mainstream like everybody else.

Mike Shinoda says that the Band likes to innovate and experiment new things each album, but this argument totally backfires when you listen to this album. This is not new, this is not original and this sure doesn't seems like innovation to me. Pop nowdays always sounds the same and One More Light is no different. Linkin Park has betrayed their own roots and fan base with the Band's weakest album yet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After listening to the album through 3 times the frustration hasn't gone away. I kinda expected a poor release based on the way the band were really defensive prior to release. The stand out song on the album is the second track, ironically titled Good Goodbye... I understand that bands evolve over time but I can't help thinking that they have taken 20 steps backwards in their attempt to move forward from the metal/ rock roots that they made their name from. I'll be interested to see them play any of these new tracks live, half the band won't actually have any part to play. Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn playing on their laptops the whole time... Great show.

Too late for a refund, but at least I can say I tried to like the album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. I an honestly say I am gutted/disappointed/sorry for this album. We all know that LP like to evolve their style, but this is 100% a ppo album! I have a huge range of music that I like but One Direction isn't part of that group. Very sad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Linkin Park has parked all the mediocrity of this generation's pop songs into this album. There's no good track here. If they want to make popularity from making pop songs, please reference the right pop songs. Strong 1 to light 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

--this review was brought to you by a luxury car company--

A mid-life crisis can come in many forms, and Linkin Park has the audacity to make us pay for theirs.  Regardless of Chester's abhorrence for the music that put him on the map (believing he could have reached the same point from a different path), I truly wanted to like this album. Yes, we understand, Linkin Park has been about the mishy-mashy of genres since they formed back in the late 90's, so the obvious argument to be made is that making a pop album is what they would have done anyway. That said, it feels like Shinoda lost a bet with Warner Bros and needed to pay the bills.

The worst part about watching the documentary that accompanied A Thousand Suns was watching Mike finally beginning to break under the pressure. Take a moment and listen to the the demo of "In the End" with Mike's original rap. Right? That sounds like actual hip-hop and not the "Cleveland Kid Music" that Don Gilmore forced Mike to use instead. So, since the beginning, Mike has been told, "look, you're good, but you're just not radio good." When they came out with Minutes, I remember Mike actually thanking the crowd because of how worried he was about the new direction--upon listening to the album, we could at least say for sure that it was Linkin Park regardless of how different it was. It's not one of favorite albums, but Bleed it Out with Rob's drum solo live is amazing. Moving along, we got A Thousand Suns, Living Things, Recharged, and The Hunting Party. As much as I loved The Hunting Party, I wish to blame it for the mess that is One More Light. It reminds me a lot of A Thousand Suns because it lacked a huge radio single upon release. I'm guessing sales tanked and Linkin Park (Mike) was left with their (his) foot in their (his) mouths (mouth). Not only that, Chesty thinks he's one of the greatest vocalists of all time. Really? How was that Stone Temple Pilots revival? Everyone flocked to the store to buy High Rise because the mighty Chesty was the vocalist was on it? No? Okay, just checking. The sad truth, is that Chesty is a great vocalist, and one of the best, but only when he is with Linkin Park making Linkin Park music. Unfortunately, One More Light is not Linkin Park music.

"Well, their original name was Hybrid theory which means that--" Yes, we know. This is a pop album made by a band that made a name for their mishy-mashyness, but each previous album felt like Linkin Park and this one feels like the autopilot on a nice, luxury brand car that offers slick style for those that will actually buy a car based on a rock band's opinion. I mean, even their Undergound albums 2-16 were better than this album. Anyway, before I go into detail for this album, I sadly have to admit that I am a fan of Linkin Park if it hasn't already been blatantly obvious from the beginning. My favorite albums from them would be A Thousand Suns, Reanimation, and The Hunting Party.

Anyway, here we go...

Nobody Can Save Me - 1/10 - A Chainsmoker's song?
Good Goodbye - 1/10 - Sucker for the Pain, anyone?
Talking to Myself - 1/10 - A terrible Adele song.
Battle Symphony - 1/10 - In the Name of Love, anyone?
Invisible - 1/10 - Firework?
Heavy - 1/10 - ...........
Sorry for Now - 1/10 - A good Shawn Mendes song.
Halfway Right - 1/10 - Katy Perry, again?
One More Light - 8/10 - I actually like this song a lot. Good job, guys.
Sharp Edges - 1/10 - An okay Lumineers song.

Unfortunately, not a good Linkin Park album.

Hopefully, the next one will be better.

Best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Linkin Park hasn't "evolved" they've sold out, but because their fans nowadays are the same people who listen to the Chainsmokers, so they'll eat this up. This is just bad, bland pop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One More Light is the worst album of the band... Battle Symphony is bearable but all the other songs are horrible, it has no redeeming factors. the bands hypocrisy is so abnocious and it hurts the albums experience even more. its not that i only like their old stuff, but the newest album and the 2 remix albums i loved all of their album. the album and the bands attitude towards the fans following this album killed Linkin Park for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Complete trash.  This barely carries the iconic sound of Linkin Park.  I have nothing against an artist trying to diversify their sound.... but this is straight up POP.  This new album is a middle finger to it's core base that supported them throughout the years.  They have completely left the genre that MADE them in its entirety.

The sad thing its not even a good POP album... the only thing selling this album is legacy of their name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm giving this a 2 just because Invisible was more like Fort Minor, which was closer to being original to any other track on the album.
They pulled out every cliché move that radio friendly songs do these days. Experimenting is a good thing, but they haven't done anything special or original.
I would be ashamed to say that I'm a fan of Linkin Park in fear they think I might actually like cheezy music 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album feels like a middle finger to all LP fans. Not the stupid HT fans who wants LP to do one more album in nu-metal, but to all the fans that love good music. The problem is not that it's a pop album, there are amazing pop bands like twenty one pilots, coldplay etc. The problem is that the songs sound like crap that have no effort put into it. AND it has only 10 songs in it. That's after a 3 year old wait, many exciting teases and delay of an album for another half a year for "improving it". I'm a huge fan of ATS, because it has beautiful instrumentals, beautiful meaningful lyrics, and it really sounds unique in some songs, though it's definetely has some pop sound in it. This new album sounds so generic you forget how the songs sounds the next day.  And after all that you hear Chester Bennington say words like "F you all you whiny idiots, listen to what we put out and enjoy it". Linkin Park has been my favourite band since 2009, but after this mess of an album and disgusting behaviour I think I'll never get back to their music. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Go away Dandy Warhols and take your little Courtney-Courtney Taylor-Taylor with you when you go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is trash. She tried to be like Britney Spears and she failed. It's basically the same beat even on the ballads. Jennifer Lopez ahold really stick to movies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lopez's promise with catchy lyrics and #1 songs tries to masquerade the fact that the album has nothing either relevant or intelligent to celebrate. All we can really notice, after a dancefloor-stuck brouhaha, is that she and her unnecessarily canonized guests did party a whole awful lot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty dull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Joel Pott can't emote, I'm sorry, and if they were just-about-above-average on their debut, this is dull dull light, lit up by Wires and Trading Air, which would be weak points on another album, but are strengths here. Pott's lyrics are one-dimensional still, but when tackling the kind of subject matter where depth is important, this album seems to have the emotional depth of a greetings card. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

simply ridiculous and ugly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Moby has continued to copy off of himself, much like he did with 18. Where 18 was a pretty dull copy of himself, Hotel is a terrible copy. It's like a xerox of a xerox of a xerox of a... until it fuzzes into a general and crappy image of the origninal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst moby album to date. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utterly bland middle of the road music suitable only for background music in cafes, elevators, shopping malls, etc. No real creativity found here, only the results of studying extra hard on 'how to write insipid indie music 101' lessons.
Every song feels painstakingly crafted; not to convey any real feeling but to manipulate and coerce the listener into feeling something heart-wrenching. But it is so painfully obvious that you are being duped because Kodaline are unable to collectively gather a shred of real emotion with which to back up their songs. They must have High Hopes indeed if they think anyone will remember them by the time album two arrives and the music world has gotten over this infection of emo-indie whingers; see Passenger, 1975, etc. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It really, REALLY sounds awful and uninspired. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

YAWN...this album was boring with a capital B Ashanti tried and failed to squeeze any amount of emotion out of her voice, so when she sings both love songs and F U songs she sounds nieter "in love" or "in rage" she just sounds tired! the only things saving this album from the 0 star rating is the amazing production on "focus" and TI's amazing guest appearence on "still down" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ben H., never favorably compare shit like She Wants Revenge to legends like Joy Division again... ever. There's no comparison in quality at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything is wrong here. The concept, the music. Catchy enough to listen to it once or twice. And yes, she's got some style, but ultimately, she's an empty marketing product. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I Kissed a Girl and Hot 'n' Cold are both amazing songs, but the rest of the album is torture. To pour salt in the wound, a few of the other songs have potential but are performed horribly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The primary problem with Katy Perry is that her voice is very thin and lacks anything vaguely called "range". Beyond that, the songs are calculated pop-trash pieces that come off as derivative and boring, leading to a truly awful experience from the first song onwards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is a complete let down. Its first single "Party Rock Anthem" is worth listening to but the rest of the album isn't. I had high hopes for this record but it was just not living up to its expectations. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is so horrible. I would rather listen to screaming kindergardeners than listen to this. If you like "Party Rock Anthem" and "Sexy And I Know It" there is a reason why those songs were released over all th other ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Funny and enjoyable, but with no focus, highlights, context or even good sounds, if you wanna really party rock, this isn't the best way to achieve what you want. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply awful. "Just Can't Get Enough", "The Situation" or "Don't Stop The Party" are sufferably and not bad. But the rest is horrible! "XOXO", "Fashion Beats" or "Do It Like This" are definitely in the top 10 of worst songs of all time. Horrible composition by talentless "musicians". One of the worst album in music history! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not really a fan of Imagine Dragons, never been. They have some alright, catchy singles, and I've heard a couple songs from Smoke + Mirrors and Night Visions, and they were kinda OK, but not really all that impressive. So I wouldn't have listened to this album if it weren't for some of my friends telling me to listen to it. I thought why not, since at the time there hadn't been all that many good albums released, and I was going to listen to pretty much anything, since I just wanted some good music. ANY good music from this year.

I didn't really find it here. The songs are generally the same quality, not many standout songs in terms of quality. I Don't Know Why would probably be my favorite song, were I to pick one. Start Over and I'll Make It Up To You could maybe challenge for that title.

The worst song on the other hand is hard to pick. Dancing In the Dark, Yesterday, Rise Up, Walking the Wire.

The style is pretty similar to their previous material. Similar pop-rock and alternative rock. Maybe a little livelier and more pop. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless you do it badly.

Overall I wasn't very impressed by the album. There were a few decent songs in here, but overall it's a pretty bad album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Evolve is the worst Album. Im totally disappointed. The only two good one are Believer and Thunder. I like the music from Imagine Dragons but with this is a total disaster. So 2 Points for Believer and Thunder. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Their music was never good in the first place, and now it also sounds dated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of Incubus from way back in the Fungus Amongus/ Enjoy Incubus days, this album came as a huge disappointment. Simplistic, Pop-ish, and seemingly dedicated to appealing to tweens, Incubus has taken a huge step backwards here. Instead of producing a BAND album, "If Not Now When" centers the band's musical efforts around Brandon Boyd's singing on top of simplistic pop tunes; resulting in bland, radio friendly trash. Not the challenging musical journey I would have hoped for from Incubus. Until now, I have liked to varying degrees all of Incubus' albums, because without exception they showed the musicality and versatility of all of the band members. This album is mostly just the crooning of Brandon Boyd over vanilla pop rock. Some will defend this album and proclaim that Incubus should be lauded for "taking risks" and going outside of their standard musical fare. If what the band produced was new and innovative I might agree, but the reality is that this album is crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bleh.  This album confirms what a lot of people have been speculating for many years: Incubus is not the band it used to be.  There is a large following of listeners who have been dying for a taste of the S.C.I.E.N.C.E days, or even a little morsel of Make Yourself.  Not only does Brandon Boyd and co. further distance themselves from those early records and innovative sound, they have launched them into orbit.  What we have here is a dull and uninspiring batch of songs aimed to get the female 13-30 demographic excited.  Whereas previously we would get a wonderful set of songs showcasing the talented band members, with a few toned-down numbers sprinkled in; we now have eleven tracks of lameness.  I certainly don't need rehashed versions of "A Certain Shade of Green", or "Circles", but what I do need is some freakin' rock 'n roll! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a huge Incubus fan, I tried really hard to like this album. Really, really hard. And I understand the idea of "evolving" or changing styles as a band. I've liked that Incubus has striven to do something new on every album. But there's a difference in changing and regressing, which is what Incubus did for this one. On every previous album, listeners can sense the amount of effort and creativity the band spent on writing their music. Even if their music style changed, one could still appreciate the music for its complexity and, for the most part, originality.  However, on "If Not Now, When?," the majority of the songs are mind-numbingly simplistic and bland. Some of the songs may even start out promising, or may have a short lick of something that sounds experimental or complex, but they then reduce down to a soft pop/ easy listening rhythm and style, reminiscent of vapid, easily-forgotten radio tunes from the 80s and 90s. To put it simply, this album was not only a disappointment, but a complete shock to fans who expect so much more from this band. I usually judge disappointing new albums from my favorite bands from a perspective that they may be, for example, "Incubus bad," or "Tool bad," meaning that they're not best quality of music put out by that particular band, but the music is still better than the majority of music out there. Unfortunately, this album was just plain bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything is just so formulaic and empty. It goes nowhere, and really says nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aside from a few admittedly fun singles, the album consists mostly of boring, loud, and sloppily written filler tracks set to sloppy and poorly produced background instrumentals. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most of this CD didn't even make me want to get out of my seat, much less groove to the music. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Black Eyed Peas can make good rap music. Fergie can sing beautifully. But they choose not to and go against any message they created in there first two albums, both created with out the help of pop singer Fergie, and now make basic poprap music with basic videos and lyrics that are laughable. Listening to My Humps make me cringe, as its coming from a group that once created Joints + Jams, What It Is and excellent callabos with De La Soul and Charli 2na from Jurassic 5. What saves this album from gettin 0 is the track Like That, which i believe is one of the best rap songs to come out this year, which features rap legends such as Q Tip, formally of A Tribe Called Quest and fellow native tounge Tablib Qweli. To sum up, even Elephunk had more street credability than this. And Elephunk has terrible once past track 5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totally uninteresting crap. Even taking this album for what it is(dance and party music), it is pure shite. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not good. "My Humps" is completely tasteless, with a terrible beat to boot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Peas need to reevualate their career after this awful blank sounding cd. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a very weak album. Most of the songs try to be dance pop songs, but the songs are not nearly the level of other similar dance pop songs out right now from Lady Gaga or Keisha. The production is horrible. Sometimes Cyrus sounds more like T-Pain than herself. The autotune was out of control as they tried to make Cyrus' songs more dance friendly or correct weaknesses in her voice. I am sure this album will sell well in the first week because of her popularity. However, if not for her famous name, this album would never sell. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Miley has a good voice and a good style, but do not know to use any of the two factors here, it gives us nothing more than the conventional, with a vocal totally full of auto-tune. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it's not that korn sucks, the guitars are really good. it's just that jonathan davis needs to get over himself and write better lyrics. and fieldy sucks at bass too. stop slapping and crying, this is strike two. one more bad one and they'll be done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album, as you might have heard by now, is far and away from his past releases. There is not ONE song I like. I know the reason/place where the songs are coming from in his life, but they are just not good. Now I can say his voice is still like a old school "crooner." Which is nice, but I couldn't finish listening to the album. Nothing caught my ear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You go from international fame to writing an entire NEW album in two weeks, that personally, in the long run, isn't that good, nor creative.  If I were Thicke, I would be embarrassed, let alone mortified that my album sold 530 copies in the UK, 550 in Canada, and 158 in Australia in its first week (don't expect future weekly sales to be any higher.)  "Paula", in the end, doesn't only sound desperate to win/get Paula Patton back, but, instead, a plea to fans not to forget him (it was released less than a year after his last album!) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Earlier this year, Robin Thicke and his partner Paula Patton separated for certain reasons. In an attempt to "Get Her Back" (see what I did there?) he decided to quickly and rather hastily write, record and release an album dedicated to his now ex-wife, hoping that she would fall back into his arms.
So does this album make its listeners feel for its creator?

(Sighs)

It seems the only one that may feel sympathy for Robin Thicke is Robin Thicke himself, because this album fails in many ways. Instead of trying to depict a man wanting the love of his life back, it feels like it is depicting a confident stalker who won't let go of the past - hoping to always get his way; it's unintentionally creepy and somewhat disturbing.

As stated prior, the album fails in many other aspects - such as having plenty of unintentionally hilarious moments, laughably bad lyrics, obnoxious backing vocals, repetitive songs that feel incredibly rushed and cheap and also having the feeling of it being much longer than what it really is. This album is embarrassing - the worst tracks being Black Tar Cloud, Something Bad and plenty of others, there isn't really a good or decent song on this album. The only things that this album has going for it is that it is rather bold, in a way that Thicke has the guts to make such an album and in a way that it does not really sound like the average sound that one would expect to hear on the radio, and Thicke's vocals are not necessarily bad, nor are they great.

Despite having good intentions, Robin Thicke's latest entry into his discography is dumb, pretentious, overlong, unintentionally creepy and laughably bad. Better luck next time buddy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

mostly the album comes off as laughable, but there will be a few moments where youll say 'this is nice.
overall you cant help but cringe at the lyrics, and its obvious this album was made quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gur, we are do not listen to Nickelback! We no like boring, unoriginal music, gurr. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was actually wrote a music column at a paper when this record came out. I can't remember what I wrote then, but I'm sure it was something along the lines of "mindless" and "juvenile." I still have this album somehere; it may be the worst album I own. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe I liked this band when I was in middle school. Okay, musically I suppose they're tolerable, and the guest appearances from the likes of Xzibit, Method Man, DMX, Redman, STP's Scott Weiland, and even Ben Stiller provide bright spots. The cameos save this album from the dreaded goose egg, which is VERY bad news for the band. Especially Fred Durst, whose lyrics reach an all-time low here (and they were never that good to begin with). He doesn't like when people talk shit about him (several songs are centered around this concept), he really wants to live the rock-star lifestyle ("Livin' It Up"), women just don't seem to understand him ("It'll Be OK," "Boiler," possibly "The One"), and then there are some songs that don't seem to be about anything at all (both versions of "Rollin'," "My Generation"). I have this feeling that if Fred Durst were kicked out of the band and they just did a Santana-esque album of collaborations with actual competent MCs, they'd be much better. I'm so glad my copy of this record is a burned CD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fred Durst layers his music with the same macho WASP misogyny and homophobia as Eminem. But unlike Eminem, he doesn't have the talent, wit, sincerity, self-deprecation or respect for his band to back it up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

will.i.am is possibly one of the biggest sell outs in history. He went from underground to making mainstream urban music (but that was decent, and Black Eyed Peas breathrough albums were good) but after the explosion of dance music 5 years ago, he went in a whole new direction. Will doesn't like not being successful and making music that's out of the loop. Urban music was suddenly old news and Will changed accordingly. After an extended break, Black Eyed Peas came back with a new album composed of electronica, completely different from all their old work and their follow-up, The Beginning, was more of the same and had such negative reception that the group went on haitus. But Will's been busy in this time, turning himself into an electro singer and producer and so we have his first solo album in over 6 years. And surprise, surprise, it's full of soul-less dance music. Will might think he's revolutionary but everything here has been done before (and much better at that). Shortly before the album's release, a controvery emerged with several dance producers claiming that Will stole their work. Their claims were completely justified and makes perfect sense  you can't go from being a great urban act to being a great dance act so easily. Something must have been stolen. Aside from this, Will's voice is sub par and he desperately tries to disguise it with an over-abundance of features from performers that are all desperate for career boosts. It's an all-round desperate album. But there are some moments, surprisingly, where we get a glimpse into the real Will. Good Morning is a gorgeous, spiritual introduction to the album, The World Is Crazy is a political song that is like Where Is The Love? 2.0, Far Away From Home is a carefree song about freedom with an almost rock edge, Ghetto Ghetto is a true to life track about the underprivelaged with a really cute feature and the real exellence comes from deluxe track, Smile Mona Lisa. This song is so beautiful with sad lyrics and the most heartbreaking classical solo from Nicole Scherzinger. A true revelation. This song made me want to cry because it was sad and because this is the kind of artist Will could be if he stopped caring about being commercially successful. I shake my head at how he has changed everything about himself, even his dress sense and hairstyle, to hang onto relevancy. The man has sold his soul for fame and only time will tell if he can recover it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I still love Will.i.am and the Peas, despite them straying from good old hip hop to electronic music, I can deal with that, and I still love them. But this album is just awful and pitiful to Will.i.am's talent 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is this a joke? Really. This album is HORRIBLE. The only good track on here is Scream & Shout and that's because it features the god Britney Jean Spears. He really needs to go back to BEP and make some music worth listening to. This sucks! 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

1 star for each cd...God himself (ok Herself, Sinead) couldn't care about this effort. Equal parts saccharine and pablum. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's not much to say. It's just a bad album by and ok band. As always, the lyrics suck, singing is ok, and all of the wanna be melodic hardcore band is really getting on my nerves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just dreadful. His debut album, Careless World: Rise of the Last King, was not that bad, but this album, on the other hand, was destined to be tossed into recycling bins everywhere. At least it was a step up, albeit a small one, from Lil Wayne's new album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst albums of the year. Insulting to the intelligence, and fails to live up to its concept (50 Cent leaves the new kids on the block in the dust, making us not care about the fresh meat, which this album was designed to show off). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being a fan of Eminem does not make this a good album.

Britney Spears trae su octavo álbum de estudio, y es todo menos un álbum de ella. Britney Jean suena genérico, robótico y sin vida. Spears prometía un álbum ''personal'', pero no hay nada de personal en todo esto. El álbum se siente más como un álbum de will.i.am que de la propia cantante. El álbum carece de sentido y de un concepto propio. Líricamente es bastante inmaduro e insulso. Un EDM genérico, autotune por doquier, canciones sobreproducidas, otras con producción a medio hacer e incluso hay momentos en donde no es Britney quien canta sino una de sus coristas, Myah Marie. Los mejores momentos del álbum son en canciones como la mid-tempo ''Alien'' o la sobreproducida ''Passenger'', y aún así se sienten insípidas. Sin duda Britney Jean es el resultado de dos cosas, una agenda muy agitada y cero ganas de continuar con tu carrera, no fue una buena decisión grabar un álbum mientras planeas una residencia, y mucho menos dejarlo a mano de will.i.am quien se adueñó totalmente del proyecto. Britney Spears necesita un tiempo de descanso, es claro.

Mejor track: Alien
Peor track: Body Ache 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's the same old thing, which is weird since Britney said it would be a personal album, and ended up showing nothing but strong beats, edited voice and generic letters. Since 'Work  to 'Don't Cry' is all soulless, uninteresting and uneventful. Fans will like (I think), but no new fan will arise from this work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Britney is one of the leading pop singers of the past, is always generated great expectations on lathes of their new work, Britney Jean comes as a promise of being a personal album, but it's a shame that all we have here is a major disaster, the highlights of the album are ''Passenger'' that shows an interesting song and ''Alien'' which sounds like a nice bubblegum music, when Britney decides to put Wil.i.am as the main producer of his album is already foreseeable disaster.

Que es esto? De verdad, que tenga de puntuacion 50 es mucho, es un album terrible que no debio existir, solo se salvan (para mi) Alien, Work **** Perfume, Tik Tik Boom, Body Ache, Chillin' With You entre otras, pero de verdad, este album es pesimo, inclusive las que se salvan no son la gran cosa... Ms. Spears, nunca debiste lanzar esto uwu 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A bad album, never heard anything so bad in my life .
Britney you lack talent to make good albums actually something you almost never met is talent.
His album is less than virtually everything heard in my life , never will recover me an album so rubbish like that.
I 'm ashamed to say that hearing this, I would rather be deaf than hear another bad job of these . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of those albums I really wished I had listened to before I bought it. Although many say they have been less than impressive of late, I purchased the CD because I genuinly like their music, ever since watching their monumental performance on MTV Unplugged. This release just doesn't do anything for me, in fact (lyrically) it actually makes me cringe at times. Such a shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All the evidence Deborah Harry ever needed to prove she wasn't Blondie. These songs might work with some of the band's cheeky recklessness behind them. As it stands, Harry's previous solo albums show she can do great work without them when she takes a less experimental tack. On Necessary Evil, it's painfully obvious Debbie is trying to be Blondie, without the rest of that powerhouse behind her to bring it to fruition. Bitterly disappointing from a usually inspiring performer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Feels like the most forced rap record i've heard in years... Will Smith is also one of the worst rappers i've heard in years... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Meth gets a 2... for 2 good songs. This release was a joke, and from the man who didn't want to do the "All I Need" with Mary J. because it was too commercial, it felt like a slap in the face to hear Missey Elliot on the CD. A crying shame. Me and some co-workers just took it out back and set fire to it --- John Blaze huh? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I actually like the one with Missy, but overall this album is an abysmal embarassment to the name Tical.. no where near being qualified to be a prequel to the classic Tical. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

311 was my favorite band for about 9 years. That being said, they have become a disgrace. They haven't put out a good album since Soundsystem. (sorry to all of you from chaos fans) I've moved on musically to any band who can change their style as the grow older, but not stifle their potential and bore their fans. Tim Mahoney is too talented for 311. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a try because 311 was my fav. band in the 90's. Of course, I was disapointed. Their sound has completely changed from back in the day. Christ, they are on the "50 First Dates" soundtrack! 311 stopped "rocking" after Transistor, as most diehard 311 fans would know. These albums did not pay off for them because they were not "pop". Can you say "time to get paid"? These last three albums have projected this once underground monster to pop sell-outs. Me and my buddies would see atleast four 311 concerts a year for 4 years. Now we can truly say we will not be to another one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a die-hard 311 fan, if anyone would be biased it would be me, trust me, and really wanted to like this album...but I just don't, and I hated to admit it to myself. These are 5 of the most talented individuals I've ever heard, but in the past few albums (beginning with From Chaos) they have totally changed their sound. "Sell out"? I don't quite think so, it feels more like a lack of inspiration, like they have run out of messages to send us. This is a sad milestone in that it's the first album in which I cannot find even a single track that I really like. "Thank Your Lucky Stars" is probably the best song, but it gets old very quick. I read a comment by Nick Hexum stating that he "felt the album was rushed", and apparently they plan on skipping a 2007 release to produce an album for 2008, which they claim will bring back the sound that made them who they are. - I truly hope so. I'll be waiting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How can an album, like this pile of sh*t, have an average of 51?! This album is a shame! First: it's not a Pussycat Dolls' album, it's a Nicole's one. Next: the songs are so KITSCH, bad, ... (The only one who's "so so" is "When I grow Up"). The rest is to burn! Believe me: just don't buy it! Only if you want to kill your ears, the most precious things (with the eyes. To see girls like Nicole dancing on the streets?!) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

POSITIVE - Not many at all. She does have one hell of powerful voice, that is without doubt. 'Price Tag' and 'Do It Like A Dude' are simply brilliant tracks, produced to perfection and deserve the success they had. But sadly that's it. the nice comments are over. NEGATIVE. "One of the biggest disappointment i've ever bought" - this was my first comment on this album. I was so excited for this album, i genuinly convinced myself it was going to be fantasitc. Winning 'Critics Choice' at the Brit Awards we all expected a polished, clean yet dirty album....but really ? Did the "Critics" that gave her that award listen to her work before hand, or was sombody paid to give her the award ? This album is terrible. I've never heard such awful vocal showboating and over the top, tyring to hard, silly lyrics in all my life. The entire album sounds rushed, unfinished and all in all boring. And at what point do artists and record labels think that it's ok to release tracks after the album and totally remix them, 'Nobody's Perfect' - dull and lifeless on the album with vocals that make you want to slap her and tell her just shut up and stop wailing (we know you can sing...so why are you still trying to proove you can?) - But amazingly after this album got such mixed to negative reviews 'Nobody's Perfect' was re-recorded with new vocals and a heavier beat...all in all releasing a good song....THIS IS NOT OK ! Your setting fans up to think the album will be as good as the single, which is not the case. And for those of us who already own the album, know this is what you've done...it's an insult. I could go on but i'm not going to.
OVERALL - A lifeless, boring, meaningless album. Vocals that are good, but turn sour after the 150th time of hearing her overuse them. It won't go down in history for any good reasons, it will drift into backgrounds of clothing shops and supermarket radios. Simply a flip off to fans who waitied so patiently for her. Dreadfull album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just... wow. This album is really bad. I'm honestly surprised it's only in the yellow. The songs are all over the place, hopping genres left and right with no flow whatsoever. The music and lyrics are so trite it's actually sometimes painful to listen to (especially L.O.V.E., Nobody's Perfect, Stand Up). I'll admit that Jessie J is an EXTREMELY talented vocalist, but it seems like she's so focused on showing off her impressive chops that she sacrifices writing compelling pop music. There's way too much vocal noodling and not enough memorable hooks or creativity. She has so much potential, but this album is a huge disappointment.

Standout tracks: Who's Laughing Now, Abracadabra 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lil Wayne's decline as an artists continues with this project, I make no exaggeration when I say this is the worst album I have heard in a very long time. Everything in this album is lacking from the mixing to the actual writing of the album, everything sounds so bland. There is not one track on this project that I can honestly say is a stand out song or that gives me any sort of hope that Wayne will get back on track. With this project, Lil Wayne has hit an all time low, with terrible lyricism, unfunny puns and a recycled subject matter this album deserves no more then a 2/10. The production was the best part of the whole album but even that became very repetitive as all the melodies sound almost the same. In the end, I wouldn't suggest this album to anyone, hopefully the reception that this album brings will wake Mr. Carter up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Never has the saying 'fell off' properly used then here. This is one of the worst albums of the past 10 years. From an artist who sold platinum albums and singles, since Tha Carter III, either he's lost his ghostwriters or fame has gotten to him. The production is also all over the place. he needs to work hard on his albums, and if Tha carter V  is his last Album, he needs to make sure its not like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as it pains me to say, judging by recent albums, Tha Carter III was a one-off, or Weezy is on too much stuff to be able to notice how truly awful this album is. Sloppy production, poor lyricism, and the only thing Wayne has going for him on this album is some half-decent features and the fact that, hey, at least it's not Rebirth. Maybe he can redeem himself with one last CD, one last shot to make an enjoyable CD with Tha Carter V, that will take us back to the days of Tha Carter III, Da Drought 3 and No Ceiling, but this is very much shown in my eyes that this truly is the death of Weezy. R.I.P. Young Money. 2/10. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wayne is no doubt a highly talented artist, but I truly don't think he cared when making this. I wanna hear the hot verses and punchlines from Tha Carter 3 & No Ceilings. Not hearing dick &  in every single song. I defended Dedication 4, but I can't defend this trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite a bad album, unlike past albums this does not have even 2-3 songs which are worth listening to. they weren't a great band to start with, and this album just feels like self-parody. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This sucks! Doesn't anyone yearn for the raw agreesive power of the first 3 albums? Why do bands feel like they must "evolve," when most of the time this "evolution" makes the band sound like crap. I am a true Korn fan since the beginning...so I'm giving it a 2/10 for recognizing the effort and layering that went into this album and "Innocent Bystander" reminds me of why I started to listening to this band in the first place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I see no reason to listen to the other user commenters on this page. Obviously most of the previous posters have a vested interest in Korn and can't be trusted to provide an impartial review. I consider my self to have a wide range of musical tastes. That said, I've listened to this album and it is terrible. It's simple music for depressed teenagers written by emotionally stunted (or just market-savvy) 40-year-olds. I would be surprised that Korn is still around, but the market they target is large and will lap up pretty much anything you throw at them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utter shit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

'Untitled' is a truly loathsome album, abandoning completely what the band and the fan base long for. Poorly constructed NIN songs and even worse lyrics leave us with the hate-inducing 'Hushabye' and 'Hold On'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Overall, 'Sticks & Stones' is pretty much everything thatâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hurry up Cher, it's been months since your X Factor trip, people are starting to forget about you! Just do a shallow pop album to appease them.. like now!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Álbum extremamente chato. A única que eu suporto ouvir  With Ur Love, a voz dessa garota  um verdadeiro desperdício, porque ela canta realmente bem, mas não consigo engolir esse álbum de modo algum. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Michael Jackson's final studio album (while alive, that is) is nothing amazing.  It's a big fall from a lot of his older stuff, and even his 90's music.  There's very, very little good here.  I would not recommend listening to it, and if you decide to buy it, I pity you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Damn you all 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The CD was slow, boring, and just not that good. I found myself flipping from song to song, hoping for at least one of the songs to show any signs of life. The skits in between were cute at first but they became annoying midway through. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Believe it or not, the LA Times really is a crappy newspaper. I mean it. I used to read it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If I want humor or pathos while I'm getting my rocks off, I'll turn to Bob Dylan, Sparks, Frank Zappa, or Warren Zevon, thank you very much. Fat Jack the schizophenic entertainer just doesn't do it for me as a metal head. Oh sure, he's got talent. But Kevin Federline can flip a mean hamburger, too. That doesn't imply I want him on the board of directors. The only thing tenacious about these guys is their dogged pursuit of cultural relevance. I guess the joke's on those of us who actually listen to this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album was terrible, like they didnt even try.. my opinion they need to take music more seriously 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

dominic masters is one of the most annoying and pretentious singers in modern music. the band are liked and thought of in high esteem due to the image, and the fact the NME likes them. The music they produce is at very best average, and for the majority of the time it does nothing to inspire one. And they won an award named after John Peel?? there is something wrong there, guerilla gigging isnt necessarily a great thing. i dislike both the music and the singer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is badly produced and sounds unoriginal. Even though it's bad, you gotta give it props since its better than her last release, This Is Me...Then. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are only four songs that I like on her album. I liked her other cds way better. I am not going to buy a cd just for one song. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is no substance to this CD. That, however, is not surprising with J Lo. The problem is that it is also not interesting or entertaining. It feels flat and forced. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When will people understand that creating hits does not necessarily mean that the songs are good? I think Katy Perry is the perfect example for this statement. On this album, she creates 5 #1 hits on the Hot 100, drawing people to disrespectfully compare it to Bad by Michael Jackson. This is grown woman who is making music and has the lyric talent of a cliche little kid. If she wants to anything like Joni Mitchell, in terms of songwriting (which she has stated is her career goal), then she needs to stop singing about childish subjects and write something genuine. Switch it up boo.
Best Songs:Circle the Drain, Teenage Dream & The One That Got Away
2,8/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most of the songs in this album are overrated/overhyped and full of AutoTune. Despite that, I like one song from this album, which is California Gurls. On the other hand, I used to love this album last year and even rated this as 10/10 until I was aware of singers using AutoTune to disguise their poor talent and that singers nowadays are untalented and overrated as in too popular especially among the teenage demographic. Therefore, I renounced my love of Katy Perry and I now rate this album a LOW score. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is just a damn mess. Getting through this album is like running a 5k that you don't care about running fast in but some jerk is screaming in your face telling you to speed up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, Katy Perry is still triyng to pass herself as a teenange pop singer. But she is not, not anymore. This album is so forgettable than her first one. Silly lyrics, too-much-screamy voice, and bad songs, this might be the worst album of this 2011. Nothing to recommend. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pesimo disco, le doy un punto por que No Like The Movies es la unica cancion buena, y Firework se salva, pero lo demas cambio mucho su estilo comprarandolo con su anterior album, sus letras llegan a ser un poco vulgares y huecas. se hubiera quedado mejor en la era One Of The Boys 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh dear lord this is mediocre, 'cater 2 u' is basically sexist drivel from the 'independant woman' while 'girl' grates with mawkish irritation and 'soldier' is dull and annoying. 'Lose my breath' has some spirit but most of the rest is a hell of interminable ballads 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

F.A.M.E. will only satisfy the twelve and unders who shouldn't even be listening to it in the first place. Anyone with depth of thought should steer clear of this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Offspring were cool back in '94. That's about it though. And sadly, I'm old enough to actually remember when Smash was released, so I guess I have my experience when it comes to punk. Yeah, so, if you're 12 years old, you may like this album, but if you're an older married guy with a professional career, then I guess you'll get a good laugh at how bad it is with all your childhood friends. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good music if someone shot the singer 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

On the bright side, these are their best lyrics to date. On the realistic side, the ideas seem recycled (just as they did on previous albums). The lyrics are especially recycled, though slightly more poetic (on the positive side...). Although I doubt any of their fans pay intensely close attention the lyrics all of the time because I'd imagine that they'd get bored with the same formulas by now. Which brings me to another point, it seems that they have a tremendous ability of masking their lackluster lyrics with overproduction and over-emotional singing. I feel that nothing has changed. I thought that H.I.M. might have originally had some potential, but they continue in the same direction. Their guitarist relies on whatever effect or amount of distortion that he is using (maybe throwing in a few pull offs or hammer ons here and there but nevertheless uncompelling) and the singer has a profound way of making the songs sound way more important than they really are. Like I said before, when it comes down to it, the songs themselves rely on overproduction. And I will go as far as to say that most of these comments apply to all of their albums, although the first and the second could have been considered original for those reasons. I'd even like to extend this overall judgement of boring consistency to the cover of the album! This is undoubtedly nothing less than a marketing ploy. They might as well put Bam Margera's face on the cover too, and maybe with a little sticker proclaiming "songs featured on Viva La Bam!!!!" Alright, I feel that I'm beginning to express my true feelings on this album in an unrestrained manner so I will revert back to my original premise. If you love H.I.M.'s (or should I say H.I.S.) sound so much that you want to continue on the same path forever, then this album is for you (and likely the next one and the next one). However, if you don't, try playing the old albums backwards. The lyrics mostly suck, so it won't be hard giving those up, and the distortion/double bass will sound pretty sweet going backwards... way more original too. Anyway, I give T.H.E.M. a 2 for effort, because the overall tone of their songs make it sound like they really really really tried. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I came into this CD with every intention of liking it. I even put it aside and waited to listen to it again after the first time I didn't care for it it just in case my disliking it had something to do with my fluctuating mood. Unfortunately for my precious hard- earned wages, it had nothing to do with my mood. The last time I bought a HIM record, it was the dented but still good RAZORBLADE ROMANCE. It was melodramatic, sure, but it had enough of a punch musically to keep it from being ridiculous, even with the lyrics never venturing far from the sad-in-love-wanting-to-die tree. That kind of thing was HIM's calling card, and I was prepared for that, but it was too much this time. On DARK LIGHT, the lyrics get even more wimp-gothy and cringe worthy (most times all you have to do is look at song titles like "Killing Lonliness" and "Under the Rose" and you get the idea of the depth of the songs), but this time around even the music can't save the disc from taking a crapsmacular divebomb. "Rip Out the Wings of a Butterfly" is practically the only track worth salvaging, with licks strong enough to support it's melodrama, with "Vampire Heart" coming in distant second. By the time "Under the Rose" had ended I was already bored and over it. And when "Dark Light" rolled around, any hopes of guitars rescuing this CD went out the window, replaced almost completely with weak string arrangements through the rest of the disc. I'm so thoroughly disappointed with this disc that if HIM ever releases another album, I will wait as long as it takes to borrow the thing from someone else to hear it for fear of wasting more money on something that will only take up space and collect dust. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a finn I would just like to take the opportunity to apologize for this appauling "music" that HIM makes, and while I´m at it apologize for Nightwish & Rasmus aswell. I´m very sorry... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of Janet Jackson. I've bought all of her albums except for Dream Street (if anyone remembers that album). Some people would say that Dream Street was her low point. Janet has somehow managed to relive her Dream Street days on this release by trying to cater an audience that doesn't even realize Dream Street exists. It doesn't work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rather than rip my clothes off, this album makes me want to put a bag over my head and breathe deeply. This doesn't even seem like the same genre as No Control or Rhythm Nation, when her talent actually eclipsed that of her brother before he decided ogling little Middle Eastern boys was a worthwhile profession. It seems that she is trying way too hard to regain a sliver of cultural cache after her faux pas on national television with song titles that my kids could scratch on an Etch-A-Sketch. Leave the song misspellings to Prince and some Meta-critics, Janet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

segui actuando 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That´s very boring! is just only a second part of Prism, some songs are just crap, nothing on this album are very impresive, maybe just the cover. I'm disappointed with this album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lazy lyrics, questionable themes, can't even compare to her other albums. In this album Katy try to be serious and mature, but ended up with lyrics like 'i'm my mothers daughter' and 'Marylin Monroe in a monster truck', this lyrics could only be compared with J.Lo's 'i feel good cause i don't feel bad'. Katy should put this in a box and go looking for her next record. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As hyped as this album was, it did not deliver. The songs aren't cohesive, the instrumentation isn't memorable, and there always seems to be something lacking in every song. The singles keep the album somewhat viable, but even they aren't anything special. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

4 long years of wait that’s the first thing I can say about this .... didn’t expect much but also didn’t expect it very low we all had heard demos that were liked since last year and even after they are added to the album and it is called like that. The album it self it’s pretty basic only 4-5 songs can be saved from it the rest is just full in songs all sound the same and heavy auto tune also releasing the singles which aren’t that great and all of them with feats wasn’t a good choice you can’t just do it to be integrated to the popular now days you ruined good chances for doing that. For an album that took 4 years to make we expected more and I can’t see any of the songs being a hit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What can I say, for the first time as a fan I'm pretty disappointed. The writing isn't nearly as good as Prism, it's not as sexy as Teenage Dream. If anything the album art lets you know how weird it is in advance. :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is not consistent. Every song is almost similar to each other. What is worse, autotune is everywhere here. And there is a lack of hits simply!
After "Chained to the Rhythm", only "Witness" and "Roulette" are worth listening to.

Despite all, I cannot recommend you this album, sorry! It is a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In her weakest album,Katy shows that being an empty hit maker for years won't help you when you want to show a little more substance.Supported by three forgettable singles,the album fails to show a more mature and conscious Katy,while trying to keep her roots in pop bangers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A Fail, As a long term believer in Max Martin and a world-class production team, I am sad to announce that this album has made Katy Perry redundant in today's pop charts (this began with 'Rise').

Every song on the album is too slow, doesn't cut to the chase, weak production and Katy Perry doesnt seem to believe the words she is singing. I was fearful after 'Rise', 'Chained to the Rythm', 'Swish Swish' then 'Bon Appetit'; these songs seemed stupidly ignorant and unaware of what sells and gets plays on the charts. Not a good product.

There are a couple of songs that may chart well around 20th-10th globally IF packaged well with a decent relevant video clip. Otherwise this is a bad egg.

Sadly Katy Perry lost favour when she began parading as a social justice warrior, political activist and dare I say, stupid puppet. At this point its over for her career but I have seen miracles like jet fuel melting steel beams.

Katy decepcionando otra vez. Sus "singles", buzz singles o pre single no sé que pendejada sea esos Katycats le ponen cualquier nombre para disimular el flop en fin dichas canciones están bien elegidas porque son lo "mejor" que tiene el álbum además de la canción "Pendulum" según mí opinión, no esperen mucho ya que no lo tendrán, si ven que tiene buen "User Score" es porqué sus fans (basta con ver el nombre de los usuarios puntuando con 10; kxtysboy, HarleyPerry, KatyCat121, Candyfornya) se han metido Metacritic para salvar el penoso puntaje que tiene ante las criticas profesionales. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Katy but this album is... Mmmm... Not all songs are bad but gurl... I really miss the PRISM era. Btw i love the artwork but the songs are so simple. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Five words: "Yelling at the Christmas Tree." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it really really sucks! boring, generic, hey i hated jenny from the block, but it's still the best song on the album! no wait, the best song is i'm gonna be alright, remix frim her PREVIOUS album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have every single one of j.lo's c.d's and I have rather enjoyed all of them...until now. She cant sing for her life and besides Jenny from the Block all the songs are ballads that she cannot hit the notes on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There may be bongo drums and bells chimes thrown in aimlessly to try and spice things up, but that frankly cannot distract from the pairâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well - Clapton's sucked for all 25 of my years, and, guess what!, he still sucks. Is anyone surprised? Oh? You love Clapton and just discovered SRV last yhear? Yeah, that means your opinion is irrelevant!! bah! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Has only two good songs on it. Forget the rest. I'm going to puke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Arrogance can make you look an idiot and such is the case with Richard Ashcroft. He seems to believe that if he tells us he is the savious of rock we will believe him. If he writes a decent song again, some might. if he keeps writing boring, MOR, lifeless, soulless rubbish he will become more and more of a laughing stock. Terrible album, like all his solo work 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why Not Nothing and Sweet Brother Malcolm aside this is an appalling album. For once the critics have got it right. The fans... Blinkered is a word that comes to mind. Desperate is another. Avoid!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

less than average attempt saviour of rock...haha yeah right 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull. Bad. I really enjoyed the harder polished edge of Maladroit, as it struck me as a creative step forward... I was really looking forward to Make Believe, and have been soundly disappointed. The songs are too simplistic, and the edge is gone. Even Beverly Hills seems like a forced effort. Worst =w= by far. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this is just plain bad. Stop holding on to these guys being what they used to be. They are simply ordinary and crappy now. Where do I start-The lyrics are plain horrible and simple. I have no songwriting talent and may be able to write better than this crap. The music is even worse. Not a single guitar riff worse remembering. nothing cool at all. It really seems like these songs were put together in 30 minutes. Do not buy, you will be sorry 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is almost entirely disposable. If these were the "cream of the crop" of all the songs the band had worked on since the last potboiler - I think it's time to hang up the instruments and stop tarnishing what's respectable of their previous material. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. Terrible. Bad. Useless. Futile. CRAP. Etc.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it Sucks 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stinks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man, this is worse than the last 2 efforts. For me, anyway, weezer haven't been the same since bassist Matt Sharp's departure from the group. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The songs are so corny, it's embarressing to actually listen to it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Soooo far removed from what is their best work ever. Oh how we long for the days of Blue Alubum/Pinkerton. I guess this is just the direction theyre going in, and it seems to be the end of what was a good run. Blame this on whoever, but this CD resembles nothing of old. I can understand you wanting to grow musically, maybe weezer fans are just hardcore on what they love....better luck next time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give it a 2 only because I saw a stripper dance to "Beverly Hills." Ever since, my appreciation for the tune has grown a bit. I thought Maladroit was horrid, but it didn't prepare me in the least for how disappointing this album is. Those who think it is similar to the first two albums in sound at all just aren't listening. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

About 2 or 3 good songs. The rest is arena-ready angst-rock garbage. Either give up or actually try the next time out, Rivers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This lazy, dull, and shameless album had me try and "Make Believe" my way to a better Weezer album.  It's so lifeless, the songs drag on forever, it tries to have heart and sincerity but fails on almost every occasion.  Beverly Hills is catchy, but depressing at a closer listen and it's also lazy.  That's the whole problem with this album, the songs are lazily constructed both in terms of music and lyrics.  Most songs only use 2 chords, and is a complete step-down from Weezer's previous album, Maladroit.  There are a few classic Weezer songs, Perfect Situation and Haunt You Every Day, but other than that this album sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is not necessarily a bad thing when an artist decides to take a new musical direction, but I believe it is in Adam Young's best interest that we state our true impressions. That being said, this album takes everything I love about Owl City and throws it out the window. His quirky metaphoric words have been exchanged for simple and often childish lyrics. I felt as if every song had to include something like "woo woo" or "oh oh oh". The beautiful complexity of his tunes have also been simplified to sound more repetitive and mainstream.
Really, to understand this album, one must simply take "Fireflies" and compare it to "Good Time". "I like to make myself belieeeeeve that planet eaaarth turns sloowwwwwwlyyy" has turned into "Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh oh". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Subway platform lite-rock. But sorta nice subway platform lite-rock. Alas. Kinda sad. What is it about some of these male 'Idols'? Reuben ??? Bo ?? Taylor ?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've really tried to like this album, but it all sounds the same to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One good song from Heart and the rest you can forget. What is Celine thinking? Some of it sounds like a Brittany Spears album. Awful songs, awful singing, unispired arrangements. A real step backwards. A few more albums like this, and I will be skipping her cd's. what a disappointment and what a sell out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For an album penned by the greatest pop guitarist ever, this is a sad affair. Johnny has clearly been caught up in the originality Black Hole that engulfed almost all post britpop bands. None of these tracks show the genius guitar work that we know as trademark Marr- rather a mixing pot of all of the worst aspects of 2000's guitar culture. But its ok, we forgive you Johnny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Baad.. What just happened? I want common's old sound back! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is nothing short of a woeful Hardknox tribute. Girls is one of the best singles of the year but the rest of this is embarrassingly bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Soulja Boy is an absolute joke. He represents everything wrong with hip-hop right now. The fact that this album actually came out should already be a shock. Luckily, it flopped. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

http://hhstateofmind.com/2014/06/04/chronique-50-cent-animal-ambition/

Animal Ambition prouve encore une fois que 50 Cent a du mal à revenir clinquant. Rien n’est réellement mauvais mais rien n’est transcendant. Cet album ferait office d’une bonne mixtape, pour laquelle les erreurs seraient peut-être plus acceptables, mais, pour un album officiant le retour d’un poids lourd habitué à squatter les charts, Animal Ambition est inadapté. Justement, 50 Cent a annoncé la sortie d’un prochain album, Street King Immortal, annoncé depuis 2011, à qui Animal Ambition est une introduction, et qui devrait sortir très prochainement. Au vue de cette annonce et de cette campagne promotionnelle toute en individualité, peut-être qu’Animal Ambition aurait réellement dû être une mixtape. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Curtis Jackson has lost its class. The new album has no highlights and bobs only to himself. It simply lacks the bite from the beginning of his career. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another generic cd from hoobastank. Their cd's keep getting softer and softer. Their faster tunes were the only thing that kept this crap bareable in the first place. Nothing creative nothing new. Just .......... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album sucks. Robbie Williams is about as authentic as a cheap Rolex bought on the streets of Bangkok. Some of the lyrics are laughably self-obsessed, and the music is about as middle of the road and bland as you can get. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of Robbie Williams and British pop in general, but this cd is truly painful to listen to. Very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE JAMES BLUNT PLZ LISTEN TO WEIRD AL your pitiful and Blunt's own rocky raccoon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Zzzzzzz. Sorry I fell asleep. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Look, are you kidding me here? This is GARBAGE. This guy spouts off with all sorts of proclamations about how his record will stand with the best of the last two decades...This is putrid, embarassing (oh wait...forgot who we're dealing with) garbage. Adding fade/delay/phaser pedals and other DATED uninspired electronic "influences" to a bunch of completely ignorant, preposterous attempted proclamations that serve as lyrics does not make an album of any worth, nor one that would be on any sort of label if not for previous sins against eardrums... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This record is terrible. I foolishly half-believed Tom and his hype. I figured he had good intentions and with members from BCR, The Offspring, and The Distillers how bad could it possibly be? I didn't think it was going to be this pretentious pile of psuedo-U2 crap. AVA aren't going to be saving anything, especially rock and roll, with lyrics like 'your best friend is not your girlfriend'. Don't waste your money, instead invest it in something worthwhile like the new Thursday CD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pure rubbish. Tom trying way too hard to be serious, to be something that has already been done. This band and album will be forgotten. Overproduced, overhyped, garbage. Blink-U2 light. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Somewhere between the part where Tom sung the lyric "It hurts" twenty times in a row, to the point where I realized that each song was composed of a single 4 second sample being repeated over and over again; I kind of missed the half of the album that God wrote. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An album that is ruined by its own poorly laid foundation. Tom Delonge was meant for one thing. Silly, poppy, satirical, poop joke, punky music. i.e. Blink 182. This CD is good for one time listening, if that. Space sounds, unbearably whiny vocals, and Tom Delonge's LOOK AT ME I'M AN INNOVATIVE ARTIST FOR REAL attitude doom this ridiculous album from the start. Leave it alone Tom. Go back to what you are good at. Not giving a shit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

very (very) dissapointing collection of boring U2 inspired tripe - if anything, it makes me wish for a Blink reunion..... sharpish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

just lame dude. I've heard U2 before ok tom 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Grow up Tom please, you still sound like your 16. This album is absurd. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My high expectations of a Queen/progressive album (as promised by Tom Delonge) were shot down after a first listen. And the more I listened to it, the less I liked it. They really tried to make stadium rock here, but it sounds like amateurs trying too hard to be famous. Maybe I set my standards too high, regardless, I can't think of anyone I'd recommend this to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Despite the best efforts of the producers, you just cantt polish a turd. It sounds like a contractual obligation to the record co. They should be asking for some of the big money they gave him as part of his contract back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst albums I have ever heard. How can you people give it a 10? You must be the biggest Robbie fans ever or be deaf to give this steaming pile of 'rap a score like that. A 10 indicates it's basicly the best you ever have heard. Get some neuance into your list of personality traits. Jesus christ. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A sad portrait of an established pop star from the 90s who is so far up his own arse that he doesn't care what rubbish comes out of his mouth to get paid. Painfully awkward rapping and stupid concepts. The title track is perhaps the biggest stinker. What was he thinking? Why would you consider rapping about T.K. Maxx costing less and Jacksons being a mess a good idea? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just horrible. It's an improvement over his final rap album, Doggumentary, but that being said, it's not that much better. Many of the tracks, such as "Get Away", "Fruit Juice", and "The Good Good", are abominations to humanity. There are, however, some good songs, such as "Rebel Way", "No Guns Allowed", "Remedy", and "Harder Times", but other than those few songs, the rest is just trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

dis album is just hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! is snoop serious????? what da   is he mixing with his weed??? i can't bare to listen to dis album cuz of his fake patios! its just hilarious and is a total fail!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

On their own, the G-rated, unoriginal lyrics that sound like they were written by a high school freshmen are enough to make this album something to be avoided. The fact that this may be the most derivative album of all time with a sound which approximates that of the far-superior Postal Service so closely that it should be a crime makes it an album that should be banned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not a very good album. The Neighbourhood tries to take a confusing route in a new style that I don't understand too well. Jesse Rutherford, the lead vocalist, sounds very dead and a lot less smooth and sexy than "I Love You" on this album. Excellent production and performance on a Moment of Silence though. ;) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a jokeThis is just a joke 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG - I thought Christina Aguilera's trip into Skankville was bad on her last disc, but Janet has become mayor of Skankville with this dirrrty junk. Besides a couple of nice tracks that reflect the true artist she can be, this is a real disappointment. I don't mind it if an artists explores or questions sexuality in lyrics, but I find it cheap to spew sex-filled lyrics that are only there to shock or get people to buy the disc. Makes me think now that the Super Bowl fiasco was totally planned and not a "costume malfunction." Shameful choices from Janet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Goodbye glory days - Hello boringness. This CD plain suck. She tries too hard ans it's sooo obvious!! The legend of Janet Jackson will die with this record. Oh well, too bad... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Janet Jackson has shocked us this year to say the least. At first,it was in front of 90 plus million viewers in her desperate ploy for attention during the Superbowl. Well, that certainly did work, and i highly doubt it was a malfunction, C'mon !! That did not even bother me, cause i like music, and i have loved Janet's music for years. Even before the Control album came out and made her the star she deserved to be. I was a fan, a big fan, of Different Strokes, Good Times and her Fame gigs. She was a fresh faced , good natured young woman. Then Control took over airwaves and i was extremely happy for her. She finally got what she deserved ...Mega Stardom. Her Rhythm Nation 1814 album is by far one of the best albums in the Pop Catalog of all time. Years went on and Janet began to , yes, grow-up. Which is fune, it is great to sing about love, and sex. But enough, is most certainly enough. Since All for you in 2001, she has become obsessed with Sex, and it is quite sad. She is such a beautiful, and gifted woman. This new CD, is just disgusting though. I know i had the choice of buying the edited version, by why, why should i ???? It can't be that bad. I was so wrong, it certainly is .THAT BAD !!!! The songs are boring and blatantly perverse, for perverses sake. She has stated that this album is about love, on the countless interviews i saw her on last week. She is wrong, it is about Lust, and Raunch. There are a few standout tracks...for example , Spending Time With You, R& B Junkie, and SLolove, are all worthy Janet songs. Though , they can not save the rest of this debauchery. Poor Janet, and Poor Janet Fans, like me.........I Miss her Much....i really do....come back to us Miss Jackson......and leave the Nasty behind ,please. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry, no. There's just so much in this album that sounds like a change of heart. Every song makes it appear like the guys were drinking their asses off while writing the album, smoking some ganja. Did it ever occur to them they were making music? The hits displayed on T.V. show how careless the band is and how "rebellious" they want to be while still sticking in some dumb bowl. Pancake music is what I call this. Flat, regurgitative, tasteless music that is eaten and then made into fecal matter the next moment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Isn't it interesting that someone as artistically anal-retentive as Rundgren the producer (see: XTC's Skylarking) engages in such sloppy choices when he records as Rundgren the artist? Add this to Faithful and the entire Utopia catalog as unwise decisions in a career largely misspent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sad but True......this is a disappointment....Prince is truly gone over to the dark side on this one folks.....for those of you who dont care about the message, the music is ok but not good enough to make me ignore the bigotry, ignorance and loneyness of the lyrics 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a whole, Wiz Khalifa’s third full length effort is terrible. Now, it is slight improvement over his sophomore LP, O.N.I.F.C., but only slight. The thing this was has over that last work is undoubtedly the number of quality songs. Four tracks here are admittedly enjoyable, but what holds this one back is the lows. By lows, I mean the other nine tracks here, as they are differing degrees of horrible with some being so ear bleedingly bad that I considered quitting part way through. The things I put myself through… 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

on the whole, it's obvious Mumford And Sons simply had nothing else to say with their more folky style predecessors and have simply gone on to be not brilliantly changed in any manner, but just further more unconvincing than before. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have given this album a week to grow on me and it hasn't. It's so damn boring. I get this won't be a popular opinion, but **** guys this is really bad. I'll write my feelings for the songs as I listen again. Heads up it'll probably be pretty scathing.

1-Tompkins Square Park [2/10]- "Oh babe." It's amazing that Marcus could read my mind and translate my feelings for this song into one line. TSP has to be one of the blandest and most vapid love "ballads" I've listened to in a while.

2-Believe [2/10]- "Well I don't even know if I believe, I don't even know if I wanna believe." Again Marcus summarized my angst for a song within the song itself. To me the song starts strong and ends on a whimper. It's far too generic and too poorly written for a passing grade.

3-The Wolf [1/10]- The first true stinker on Wilder Mind for me. Whereas TSP and "Believe" are just drab, "The Wolf" adds the element of being characterless. It almost sounds like Christian Rock it's so sterile.

4-Wilder Mind [6/10]- The title track is one of the few songs I actually simi-enjoy. It's still safe, but at least there's some lyrical content to hang on to this time. It's still not great or is it even that good, but I'm still so jaded by how awful "The Wolf" was I'll settle for okay this time around.

5-Just Smoke [4/10]- Back to the spiritless love songs? Ugh. Fine. Goddamn it just put a banjo in the chorus and it almost seems like "Just Smoke" could have been saved from mediocrity. I will say "Just Smoke" is far more fun than any song before it, so it scores a bonus point for putting some caffeine in this Ambien of an album.

6-Monster [3/10]- **** you telling me what not to do, I'll pick at the seams of this song all I want. "Monster" sounds like any other rock song on the radio right now: flat and lifeless.

7-Snake Eyes [6/10]: I quite like "Snake Eyes." Yeah it's still safe and pretty generic, but at least it's more lively and fun than the previous six songs.

8-Broad-Shouldered Beasts [1/10]- The only thing more boring than this song is reading my review of this album, probably. Also, B-SB is also particularly maddening to me because of the pace problems. The verses are so ****ing slow I get pulled out the song every time I listen. The only saving grace for B-SB, to me, are the quick and impacting choruses.

9-Cold Arms [3/10]- It's haunting. Not the song itself, but the fact Mumford and Sons seem to be shells of their former selves.

10-Ditmas [0.5/10]- Worst song on Wilder mind. Holy **** it's bad. I'm actually having a hard time formulating words for how much I distaste "Ditmas." Lyrics are ghastly and the music is appallingly undistinguished.

11-Only Love [2/10]: I'm fairly certain teenagers write deeper sonnets on their desks in Biology class. The first half of the song sluggishly builds to an unenthusiastic payoff. It's strange, Mumford used to be so good at making music that built towards climactic finales, but he seems to have lost his way in that regard.

12-Hot Gates [3/10]- Like "Only Love" before it, there is so much build up for no payoff. It's musical blue balls. It's just like dry humping for ten minutes then having to leave for dinner.

My final score on Wilder Mind 2/10. I came into this album with such high hopes, but I left feeling so underwhelmed and sad. Sad that the best part of Mumford has died with their banjo.
Edit: I'll make it clear. I quite liked Babel and Sigh No More, but that just makes my disappointment sting all the more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing. I can understand the desire to try something new and prove to the critics that they are not just all strings and guitars. However to leave their signature "Mumford" sound behind, they end up sounding like a Coldplay cover band. Sorely disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

M&S traded their unique sound and energy for mediocre generic pop-rock. When I listen to this style (and I do, often) I listen to bands who do it well, not this "me-too" crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are so many good singers that probably deserve more attention than Susan Boyle. She has a nice voice but it is at the same time very limited. I believe that is why all the songs are slow ballads. No, this is not a record I would buy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boyle has the sparkle of a hard boiled egg on this set of infinitely dull songs. She's been made over, tarted up, set-up and transfigured but she and her singing are still just as plain as her name suggests. Look at her on the cover holding back or covering up the fat on her face so that she appears to have a thin face - the producers and photographers must have thought they really pulled a fast one there. The songs on the CD are in a similar way a cover up. They are lifeless and drab, the accompaniment worthy of elevator musak and Boyle's singing is inconsistent and patchy at best. She had one moment of glory on Britian's Got Talent - it was a moment in which she unconsciously admonished all those who judged her on her appearance - it was a glorious moment for the underdog but that moment is long gone and does not come through on this CD. It's a big step from being an underdog to being a star. All those people who were eager to cash in on her world wide instant stardom wanted to make that step a small one so they could get their share of Boyle's market. No doubt got their pocket's full but unfortunately Boyle doesn't have the talent her producers would like her to have. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is embarassing for real rap artists. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This posthumous album does not withstand any of Michael Jackson's previous materials. The album can be associated to as a compilation of songs from his previous album that did not make the cut. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a tremendous letdown. I understand trying to stay relevant and getting radio play, but part of what made Maroon 5 great is that they're good musicians who write good music. But now they're outsourcing all that to hot names in the industry, and the result really stinks. Lousy hooks, boring production, lame and lazy lyrics... I'm hoping they listen to all their alienated fans and come back with a second 'Songs About Jane', but I have a feeling that band is lost now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maroon 5 was one of my favourite rock-bands, but all I hear on this album is pop. They didn't have to change, but it was obvious that "Overexposed" won't be another great album. After "Hands all over" which was great, this is an unexpected disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

maroon 5 is dead......................................................................R.I.P.................................................................. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Payphone and Moves Like Jagger are strong singles.....but the rest is terrible. This album is missing soulful songs such as "She Will Be Loved" that made them so successful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to admit payphone was a good song. However, the album is really not that good.  Maroon 5 means Adam Levine in this album. I was dissapointed because the songs weren't that good. I don't think they are the same as they were before and they have changed in a bad way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a damn disappointment. All I can say. It gets a 2 because it's Maroon 5, and I really hope that they just make another Jane album again. This was a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know I probably sound like everyone else here but I can't help it, this is a terrible album just downright bad. The lyrics are lazy, the vocals are lazy, the production is lazy, the whole album just feels like a Adam Levine phoned it in and just decided, "Hey, lets go full pop for this one. Screw what made Maroon 5 famous, this is my band now." "Love Somebody" is the only song on here that deserves any recognition of any sort but the rest of the album is truly rock bottom for Maroon 5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just the kind of horrid schlock he music world needs no more of. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are only a couple of good songs. There are too many filler songs here. Nothing exciting about this album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If Lady Gaga were a character on Jersey Shore, she'd be Ke$ha. Absolute garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i think timberland is just a little full of himself. hes a good producer yes, but he's no bob rock for sure. and he might be decent rapper, but ive heard better in my day. and jsut what in the green hell is elton john doing on this album??? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pathetic follow up. Not one catchy tune there. Really flat pop. Forgettable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. Not much more to say. The dark, pulsating sounds of bassy synths found in Moroder's old work have been replaced by sugar-coated production that, when not playing to all of the most clichéd conventions of modern-day "pop", is downright embarrassing. Moroder's brilliance has been taken over by the modern-day Top 40 music scene like a virus takes over a host cell. This album crushed me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Go away, please. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is  by far his worst album yet, even worse than the previous one. It basically sounds like a demo record and a dud one at that. Only track here to me that is any good in its entirety  is Not This Time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album was trying in the extreme, I have to say. For a few moments, it's fun, but after more than a couple minutes, the thick production becomes overwhelming, the business of the mix becomes annoying (and I love things with busy songs, look at Broken Social Scene to see it done right), and everything just comes off as an unsuccesful attempt to show off. All the obnoxiously obvious influences here put Mika to shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

|The reviewers got it pretty right with this album. Pretentious pop rubbish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No, just no. Don't buy this. Don't encourage him. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Derivative, camp and uninventive. Avoid 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Apart from Lollipop this blows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

More of the same. More of the same. More of the same. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Alanis proved through the years to be as talented as a musician as she is a good partner in love  something we can conclude embarrassingly through her excessive private life exposure in her songwritting where everybody else is always the problem, never her. Though her first solely self produced album  Under Rug Swept  had quite good hooks for her then assumed radio-lite-pop rock orientation, so far in the last 10 years she just released rubish and lazy work. Havoc and Bright Lights  I love how the titles of her songs and albums are so pseudo intellectualized  is however the worst of all. Some may think she just succeeded during her lifetime career thanks to her producers who polished her talents  specially Glen Ballard  however she already proved to do fine by herself and Mrs. Morissette problem here is actually lazyness to cope with her own work. If the title for her works are pompous and promising, you always happen to find out is just a fancy wrap for a cotton candy tasting like water. She should just embrace her now motherhood and save us from the baby lullabies. Better follow Kate Bush example and stay home baking cakes and taking care of your son. Your husband can pay the bills, you don't need to embarrass yourself anymore Alanis. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a massive Charlies fan. I have every LP and single since year dot. Simpatico is watery pablum. Must try harder boys. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

give up, you had your time in the mid-90's, now you suck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a die-hard Wilson/Beach Boys fan for over 25 years, it tears me up to realize that this is one of the five single-worst Beach Boys-related albums ever released. That makes two (1998's 'Imagination') bad albums in a row. The ONLY saving grace is the duet with Carl on "Soul Searchin'" and even THAT was better on bootlegs with The Beach Boys' backing vocals. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hell happened?!?!  I mean.......seriously, what the hell just happened?!?!?  This can't be the Cold War Kids.  This is the freaking Kings of Leon with a better singer.  Awful.  Pantently, mesmerizingly, stupefyingly awful.  Someone ship this producer off to the south Pacific or something.  He's ruining perfectly good bands. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you have enjoyed the last 2 albums by Kings of Leon, then you'll probably find pleasure in this as well. Cold War Kids are not a bad band and that's why this album is so disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The user who mentioned Nickleback gave away more than they probably realise. The problem with The Silver Lining is how bog-standard it is throughout. Pirner's once sharp lyrics (Black Gold, Somebody To Shove, Cartoon) are now riddled with cliches and the music is criminally lacking in hooks and the frayed-at-the-edges rawness of the pre-A&M days. There's nothing wrong with a band growing more accomplished and polished with age but Soul Asylum have become a tired, uninspired MOR rock band, more similar to the aforementioned Nickleback than their former selves. When you consider that these guys were once mentioned in the same breath as The Replacements, Buffalo Tom and Husker Du, a lame effort like The Silver Lining is criminal. The last great song from a member of Soul Asylum was Dan Murphy's Ill-Fated with Golden Smog. On the strength of that song and what the band were once capable of, there is still a glimmer of hope for Soul Asylum. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A couple of weeks on from the release of Bloc Party’s fifth album, I have collected my thoughts on a career defining album following the changes in style due to a band reshuffle.

First I must state, that for any fan of garage or the more ‘punk’ sound this is not the album for you. Bloc Party seem to have let go of thrashy street sound that has been a theme throughout their albums of yesteryear. No longer will we hear the pure raging guitar sound of Bloc Party favourites such as ‘Helicopter’ or ‘We are not good people’. The departure of drummer Matt Tong has obviously had it’s repercussions on the sudden change of style employed by Okereke.

There is a certain 'loss of urgency' in the new style, which won't please old school Bloc Party lovers. This is down to the much more downbeat lyrics used in the new album. Altogether their music has shifted down a couple of gears, and for me that is a huge shame.

The opening track ‘The Love Within’ is a powerful opening track, stating their intents for the future. It is obvious from the start which band member has departed due to the lack of heavy bass. A much substantial influence from the dance/pop scene is used in this track, and for me, got the album off to a rocky start.
Immediately when a early released track appears on my Spotify feed I usually jump for joy, but as ‘The Good News’ popped up a couple of weeks before the album release I held back. Knowing that a change in style was imminent I listened with little expectation. Despite not resembling anything produced before by the London group, it gave me a pleasant surprise. It doesn’t stand up to the popularity of previous records but offers a different sound. With a pinch of blues influenced mixed with a lethargic rhythm it is the only track of the album of jumps out at me.

The final thing I will pick up on is the spiritual element of the album. Kele Okereke has denied these claims, although surely even the title justifies it. Aside from that, this is an album I wouldn’t recommend, it goes against all that Bloc Party have produced in the past 11 years, unless you able to accept the change, this album is a total disappointment, 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"The Love Within" would have been a good starting point for an album that got crazier and crazier with interesting guitar effects as it went on. Instead, it is as experimental (which is saying that much since the song sounds like a standard EDM song) as the album gets, and the album only gets duller and slower.

The only standouts on the album (since basically all the songs are slow ballads) are probably "Fortress" and "Exes." They stood out for their lyrics and Kele's singing.

The last song "Living Lux" sounds a lot like "Ion Square" and has some more experimental, subtle guitar effects. But they come and go, never repeating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I honestly do not mind "No Lie" with Drake (even as a non-Drake fan), but otherwise, this album is pure trash. Who allowed 2 Chainz to touch a microphone and why did they? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hella overrated rapper, I know that before I listened to the album, but still want to hear it for some reasons... Lyrically sucks, but half of the album is still listenable especially for beats. Anyway it's crappy album and might be the worst album I ever heard.
Lyrics  0/10
Beats  4/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really, I should be giving Tauheed Epps a minus one for this horrendous album. I can't believe I bought four of the songs on it. But "Based on a T.R.U. Story" is one of the most hilarious albums I've ever heard. Each track has handfuls of amazingly stupid quotes that could come from no one else but Two Necklaces himself. Supplied with decent beats from producers like DJ Mustard, Chainz absolutely ruins them with his awful delivery and horrific lyrics. The only reason he gets two points is because whenever I'm in a bad mood, I pull up "I Feel Good" and laugh until my vocal cords blow out.

2 CHAINZ LYRIC SAMPLER:

Track 01  "Yuck!"

I'mma start a riot, I'mma start a riot
I'mma start a riot, I'mma start a riot 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2 chainz is a great rapper and he is clever and funny, but his solo career is horrendous. Weak hooks, weak production. the album is straight up awful and one of the least enjoyable albums I have ever heard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Six songs in and I've not heard anything distinguishable from one to the next... every beat is generic, and there are only so many times a theme can be repeated... You do crack, you boast about guns and money, Louis V, and you like strippers, almost as much as someone else's girl... I got all that from the first 10 mins. All the depth and complexity one would expect from a one-dimensional rapper who delivers gems like "If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs" or "I am gettin' to the money, Crocodile dundee" and dont get me started on the laughable vocals on 'I Luv Dem Strippers'. Even the one genuine opportunity at something meaningful on 'Ghetto Dreams' turns out to be more dreaming about making cash. In all honesty, Im proud of myself for staying awake through this drivel... PS. It helps if your TRU story is actually interesting.
My Top Tracks: No Lie, In Town, I Feel Good 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man.. i don´t give low scores as easily as i did with this one but come on man.. this album is **** The only reason i even give this 2 points is because Chris Brown is on it, and even that song isn´t all that good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would give Mount Ninji a 0, however it does prove it has originality, though none of it plays well. The whole album is basically what hell sounds like to me and in trying to understand Die Antwoord's appeal, I find myself looking for a diamond in a pile of dung. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is basically a repeat of their previous album. They're still whinny as crap, the lyrics relate to all their other songs and it's just not enjoyable at all! (at least for me) music is doomed if this is considered good these days! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"V" is a misogynist, sexist record with no artistic value, and with Adam Levine at his worst. If you ate the worst CD you could think of, digested it, and then crapped it out, you'd probably crap out something better than "V". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is there a worse band out there? Just in case, I'll give this a two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a dissapointment. 'Sunlight Makes Me Paranoid' put them at the forefront of the Post-Punk revival while this album appears to expose them as mainstream sell outs. The difference between the two albums parallels the difference between Hot Hot Heats' 'Make Up the Breakdown' and 'Elevator'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Who cares about onoriginal crappy Nu-Metal these days? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just typical pop music. nothing inventive. And at about 80 minutes it gets very old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hot damn, this is dull. Butter-knife-in-my-great-grandma's-attic dull. Skipping-rock dull. Makes-Kenny-G-hot-by-comparison-dull. Capiche? Pinch me, anything to get me out of my BNL-induced nightmare. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a horribly bland and tired album. Wake me up when it's over! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like their last effort, this Album just doesnt stand out. Its almost impossibly dull and safe. While the lyrics, at times, suggest they once had some sort of hedonistic life, the tedious nature of the songs makes you doubt the reality of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good ballads, solid Britney-shaped musical experiments like Elastic Love...and then everything else, which could be worked on and made better...ending the song with her kid saying You Are Mummy was the nail in the coffin for me, on this painful, fake, over-sexed, self-indulgent record. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A horrible album for someone talented like Christina Aguilera. I loved her and her music but Bionic is no where near her standards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

X-tina, X-tina, X-tina... This album is terrible. There is 3 songs that are good. Like who does she think she is? Circles is one example of a true filler. The lyrics are written horrible. I hope she can come up with something actually good next time, or her career is going *plop*. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's over for this band.  Nothing to be disappointed about in the least.  The band since Temples of Boom has continued to push the envelope with different sounds but nothing to date has been truly as magical as albums 1 and 3.The record?  Well, just because your friends or have a similar cultural similarity doesn't mean you should make then guest star on your album.  Morello and Everlast tracks are absolute busts which after the anticipation of this album almost make you mad if not flat out wondering if they are using too much product in the studio.I'm sure this album will be a fan favorite in any barrio or set in LA but that is where it ends.Recommendation - find a producer that will match your talent and push you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why did they abandon a unique, catchy, but still quite radio-friendly sound for this?  They're gaining nothing and losing everything that made them stand out from the crowd.  More Than Just a Dream started them down this path, but managed to balance the full on pop songs with songs that carried on the legacy of their first album.  There isn't a track on this generic trash pile of an album that hasn't earned a place in the landfill of forgotten and discarded pop detritus. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well yeah this album not shambolic but not brilliant either without a doubt a negative review the days of female rappers like Lil Kim and Missy Elliott are over with Iggy and Nicki shame really they were brilliant days. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This album is so bad it hurts to hear. There's nothing really great or outstanding here, it's not a classic. Iggy Azalea has no talent, how can she thinks she is good enough to reinvent hip hop music? She can't even freestyle. Oh, she is a slave master? Funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ruim. Rapper, sério? Ela vai ter que comer muito arroz e feijão para ser uma BOA rapper, mas acho difícil com a voz irritante dela (sério, que voz chata), mas dou dois por Black Widow, não pelo desempenho dela, mas pelo o da Rita Ora que foi MARAVILHOSO. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The way she raps it´s just to awful. The beats aren't good. Terrible. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this trash is not rap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cried when I first listened to this album. Not because it's that bad, because it's by Linkin Park. When they released Meteora in 2003, I thought they had stuck to nu metal, unlike bands like Papa Roach. But then this came out... This... Well it's an okay album, just not an album suited for Linkin Park. I rarely (if ever) heard Chester scream in this album, even though that's his greatest talent. A screamer you can actually understand! How often do you get that? Yes, I'm pointing at you Slipknot! And only two songs have rap. TWO!! Poor Mike Shinoda, stuck with his rhythm guitar or whatever. On my list of all the bands I have, LP as nu metal scored #1, while LP as altern rock scored... #29. Maybe that's why I'm so upset at this album. They were my favorite band...

FYI- I love Slipknot, both as nu and heavy metal. I also still love Papa Roach, despite their switch to hard rock. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

linkin park? i cant imagine anyone older than 15 listening to them. 2 ok songs on the cd but thats it. shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Long-time LP fan... ex-fan now. This is an HORRIBLE CD: all that sound that made LP to be "Linkin Park" has disappeared in an ocean of pop tunes! Terribly bad CD. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love how people are surprised that this album is terrible. Linkin Park has always been awful... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Here we go another Metallica trying to make a "change" in their sound. It SUCKS! Hope they get horrible reviews and go back to Hybrid Theory style. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A HUGE disappointment. I love LP and I enjoyed every single track on Hybrid Theory and Meteora. I thought that this was going to be gold and now I am looking for any way to sell this CD. Their songs have lost the energy and the flavor that made them so popular. While I did enjoy "What I've Done," most everything else is just garbage. I really hope this is just a phase....really, really. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A 2 because I know it's work to actually record an album. But man, there's absolutely no creativity here. Bar chords are an embarassment. Even the quality of the recording sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The whole album is a huge disappointment. I found only three tracks worthy of keeping on my computer and none worthy of my ipod. They have changed to sound more like the horrible pop we hear all the time on the radio. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Definately not their best material. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

'A move away from their established rap rock sound' is a move away from everything that made them interesting and fun in the first place. Without it, they're just a generic mainstream band. Papa Roach pulled this same crap with Getting Away With Murder (and this album even borrows from that one in parts) and it really annoys me. EW got it right on the money when they said 'every new effect sounds borrowed'. LP, cutting and pasting a day's worth of commercial radio does not equal growth. Please put some effort into your next album. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

These guys sucked ALL ALONG. You fans that are so shocked at this record must not have been listening in the first place. DREADFUL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

didnt work for me.....not at all 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My children think these guys are gods. And you would hope that having Rick Rubin behind the board would bring out the best in these schizophrenic songsters. Uh, nope. They still suck. It just goes to prove the old adage that you really can't make chicken cordon bleu out of guano. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You know, if LP stuck to their old rap-rock sound, this would be one of the most different sounding and risky albums of 2007. The non-album track 'QWERTY' showed they could still do it. Unfortunately, this album has gone the way of every other rap-rock band- instead of being truly non-mainstream and just playing their music, they would prefer to dump their old style and adopt the latest 'genre of the month'. Seriously, this album is so bland, generic and cookie cutter. It's like a greatest hits of emo bands from the past 3 years, not to mention the massive U2 influences. There are some songs where they try stuff just for the sake of trying it, like on In Pieces they have a really boring guitar solo just so they can have a guitar solo. Also, Valentine's Day is pathetic, such a whiny load of crap, the chorus will either make you burst into laughter or burst into singing 'Forever' by Papa Roach (same riff but PR's version has a better melody). Also, what is with all that stupid hand clapping? It makes Given Up almost unlistenable. The two best songs are probably Bleed It Out (coz it actually has some ENERGY, even though the lyrics are brain dead) and The Little Things Give You Away because it has some pretty well-written lyrics about Hurricane Katrina (however, the bit at the end where Chester sounds like Bono makes me wanna hurl). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Two points for the two songs that sound like what Linkin Park fans actually want, (notably the two released singles) The rest of the points are lost to the Nickleback/Limp Biskit mashups that make up the rest of the songs (notably, the ones NOT released as the singles...) The new sound is weak, and the proof is in how they hide it with the two "old style" singles. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What happened to my favorite band? From a band that looked like they could do no wrong... countless hits, CD's with not a single bad track... an effortless flow, side projects that were groundbreaking... comes this? I feel so ripped off! OK, there's a couple good tracks that stand alone... but this CD has NO flow. It's just single tracks thrown together in no particular order. And what's with the hand clapping on Bleed It out? How do you call a song "Bleed It Out" and make it sound happy with screaming? That's just the biggest trainwreck of a song I have ever heard. And Chester sounds as soft as a Backstreet Boy on Leave Out All The Rest, while Mike Shinoda seems to have used all of his rhymes that he left off of Fort Minor for this album... or maybe he just had writers block? I really hope these guys make another album... and make it quick! This was supossed to be the band to "Rock the Next Decade"... but if this is what their going to put out... we will have to find someone else to carry the torch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Two good songs on it. The rest just plain stink. At least I have something to throw at my cat now. They could have rocked without going boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just don't know what happens!??! It's not Likin Park anymore, I almost though it was U2 sometimes...Very bad, what can I say more...The single wasn't that bad but the rest of the album is just terrible, there are maybe 2 or maximum 3 highlights and that's it, the rest of the album is just good for garbage...Sorry guys, Meteora was way much better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Give me a break. Usually first impressions and guess are correct. So, if you had to play it over and over again to like it, go back to your first time listening to it, when you said, "Man, this sucks." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

of course, just like all our hero's, they all disapate. Sorry, for Linkin Park's lost, but they used ti be good! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this a 2 because thats the number of good songs on this cd. I was a diehard LP fan, and they give me this??? Where the hell is mike shinoda? Why he is he missing from most these songs? Most these choruses are so un-LP, all they've learned and done well was thrown out the window. As they said in the interview, they tried not to do something similar to their old songs, and that was their biggest mistake. Everyone loves LP for Meteora, and especially Hybrid Theory, and so the people who loved to listen to that do not easily transfer to this music. I hear clapping (wtf?) and a majority of chester. i love chester, but why the hell does he have to sing the ENTIRE song alone? Where is the great rapper that we had in Mike, and where are his fast and great lyrics? Chester is not a ballad singer, so why is he trying? If I wanted ballad and happy songs I'd listen to Josh Groban or Backstreet Boys, but no, I want LP!!! They need to go back and do what they were good at. Even the cover of the new CD turned me off... their old artwork and appeal is now all gone with a boy-band like cover. guys standing on a beach... i mean, come on, how cliche. Linkin Park, you may just have killed the fan in me. I hope next time you don't spend so much time making something so disappointing. I'll be waiting for that next album that converts me back to the religion that was the great LP. I'll always remember Numb, In the End, With You, Forgotten, Faint, Breaking the Habit.... and more great songs, but I'm pretty sure I'll remember only one song from this album, and that's cuz they play it so much on TV. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never liked Linkin Park. I didn't like them when they were young, filled with manufactured adolescent rage, and just being loud for the sake of being loud. I don't like them now that they're trying to be sensitive and thoughtful. I'm not even into U2 or Coldplay, two of the bands they're obviously aping. So who are they trying to appeal to here? If it's me, then radio still has no idea who I am. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been a huge fan of Wiz since Pittsburgh Sound, and I really am elated at his success, but it saddens me to my core at what he has become. There was such promise, and I had such hope that he was the one, a phoenix rising from a sea of ashes of mediocre hip hop, though it has become painfully clear that he is nothing but a false prophet, a fraud. I know that Wiz owes me nothing, but I can't help but feel cheated about what could have been. Hope is a dangerous word, but I am afraid that is all I got now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another dud from Wiz. Not only is his music one dimensional, but it's also not very good. As mentioned in another review I saw, the best verses honestly came from guests, though The Weeknd on "Remember You" and Cam'ron on "The Bluff" stole the show. If you want to check this album out at all, just check out those two songs and move along. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

disgusting! a waste of time and money! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Peter H Doherty is butt ugly. Even if you put him in rehab for two years, washed his face, cut his hair and dressed him up proper, he would still look like a limey Fred Samford. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Incredibly messy. Aweful to listen to- a complete waste of money 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's really quite inept. Doherty may be a talented individual, but he doesn't show it here. Songs are at best average. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor half-hearted effort. If it weren't for the fact that Deherty is such a notorious drug addict with Kate Moss as a companion; then no-one would even bother with this album! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst album i own. It is a mess of ok material, performed badly by a over drugged, over paid lead singer! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked him better when he was drinking or what ever it was he was doing. This album has his voice in it, but i really don't hear any artistic vision. He goes where he has been before with acoustic guitars and smokers rasp, there is no new ground covered. I wounder if any of the people that have been giving it a 10 really listen to Chris. I find it hard to believe if liked this album that you liked his previous work. Lyrically it is bland and unimaginative and that is very not Chris. I hope he remembers that pain is still a part of human life even when your not drinking or doing "what ever". That is how he connected with his market, not every one can be as happy as a rock star...... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really disappointed with this album. I am a big fan, Chris Cornell is one of my favorite artists, but this album lacks substances. It is a whole bunch of radio friendly music that has nothing good about it. Even his cover of Billie Jean sucked, the live acoustic version was so much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This record is a complete disaster, and he owes me an apology for buying and spending 45 minutes listening to this crap. Is he trying to appeal to Chris Daughtry's audience? All I can think of is Kim Thayil or Eddie Vedder listening to this and either a) laughing or b) crying at what their friend/bandmate has become. What a disgrace. Probably, the worst CD I've bought in the last 10 years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

chris cornell what the hell did you think you were doing when you wrote this crap??? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They are a bad punk/pop band who thinks they can rock hard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A pretty bad CD...comes off as overly repetitive and sugary punk-pop mixed with post-grunge. And this isn't emo guys; neither are New Found Glory or Simple Plan. For some pioneers of the emo genre you can listen to groups like Rites of Spring, Sunny Day Real Estate, Moss Icon, Embrace, and Mineral. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was dissapointed in this album, as were most of my friends that bought it. All of the things that made the last album good, just didn't come out here, all the songs are too repetative. The lyrics also suffer from repetition and are bland. hopefully this band can get out of this slump of bad songwriting (or "cd" writing i guess). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In order to have 3 guitarists in a band and implement them nicely, they all have to actually do something different and unique. They all three play basically the same bland, repetitive, drop d chords and it's pathetic. This is some of the most generic and untalented music you will ever hear. I am ashamed they are from Ohio, because they are giving the state a bad name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is a big difference between taking risks and simply releasing work that is mediocre at best, rubbish at worst. There is clearly no one around to say, "No, Neil. No." From 1967-1979 the man could do no wrong. After a decade of mediocre work there was a bit of resurgence from 89-95. For over 20 years now Young has released a lot of bad records. Even the better sounding ones sport poor songwriting. And that, sadly, is the bottom line: the man no longer writes good songs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Peace Trail must come close to {if not be} a career nadir for Young. As others have said it's an album best forgotten. Hopefully he can stop the rot before it risks ruining his legacy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to agree with molecular. Young has given us some incredible music over the course of his career and more than a little dross. Unfortunately Peace Trail falls into the latter category. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One half baked record after another after another after another after another after another after another after another...and just like that 20 years have passed.What's the point? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was actually shocked by how bad this thing was. The only good track is "Things I Never Said" and everything else ranges from weak to just plain awful. Commercial pop-rap at it's worst. The iTunes bonus tracks, "I'm Beamin" and "Shining Down", which I initially thought were going to be on the actual album, were actually pretty solid tracks....which makes how terrible the final version of this album was even more perplexing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

South African band from Kaapstad, known for single "Enter The Ninja" - Die Antwoord with their latest "Then$ion"  won't impress anyone. The CD is first too long - which only intensified the feeling that is full of useless junk - such as short hip-hop interludes like: "Bath" and "Uncle Jimmy", too childish and "sweet" for the rave - "Baby's On Fire" and some complete parody of good music - "So What". Only on what you can pay attention are both parts of "Never Le Nkemise" - first a combination of rave and classical music, the other purely techno. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Die Antwood lacks of inspiration and talent. Bad lyrics and production among the worst I've ever heard make this album one of the worst in the history of music. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sure, it may be better than some melodies on iTunes but... musically, this is just horrible! It is not about people being die hard Pinkerton fans. It is about the fact that people KNOW the potential of Weezer and to listen to an album like this just breaks your heart. You know those times in college when you wrote an essay the night before it's due when you had all semester to work on it? Well, that is how this album feels, a solid F. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Once again, there isn't really an excellent song anywhere on this album, as with the last few Weezer albums starting with Make Believe. The best obviously being If You're Wondering if I Want You To (I Want You To). The lyrics are painfully forced. Every rhyme makes me think of Cuomo sitting at a table and thinking, "What rhymes with 'had'? OF COURSE! 'Sad!'" Like seriously. The lyrics on this and the last few albums sound like mediocre middle school poetry. There are also multiple musical/stylistic faults I found with this album. For instance, the guitar solo starting around the 2-minute mark of In the Mall sounds so similar to the guitar solo of Rush's Tom Sawyer. Search it up. It's ridiculous. (Not to mention the track also has an obnoxiously loud main riff that doesn't remind me of going to the mall ever.) Also, noting that one track, Love Is the Answer is a 'Hindi Version' of a song on Spotify could not be more offensive, and I'm not even Hindi. The last thing this album needed was a racial song title. This album is full of flaws, and it deserves to be criticized. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A veces, es increíble cómo te puede atrapar cierta mediocridad por parte de un artista que, es visible cómo se trata de una broma que ya tenía en mente Rivers y sus compadres. Con canciones pésimas, reflejándose dramáticamente con canciones como "Can't stop partying" y "In the mall", quizá guste de adolescentes que estén en su pleno vivir de aquellas juntas en donde las fiestas alocadas se desatan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very dull. Disappointing for Lou Barlow fans. Hoped for better but, got what I expected. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible. I've been a GGD fan for years and the magazine reviews above are right on. It's as if they forgot how to play rock music. They're producer should be fired. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe this is from the same band that brought us the immense Superstar Carwash & Boy Named Goo - it's truely awful, full of lazy overblown, soft rock cop outs, like they have taken Iris and Name and put them in a blender - Robby Takac must be really cheesed off that his band have sunk so low - and by the way, the GGD's are my fav band ever, so this album hurts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was one of the first to buy the debut "Yourself or.." when I first heard the original song "Long Day". I then fell in love with all the songs on the cd. It was not until about six months later that the Dallas radio started to play other songs. Anyway, I was waiting very anxiously for the new album which by the way, took WAY TOO LONG (3 years!). Anyway, Mad Season was very very disappointing! Why all the orchestra crap! They sound like they are trying way too hard and have a very large budget. I wish they would have not sold so many CD's! They then may have went back to basic rock-n-roll music again. Bad follow-up. 30 something 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible, two stars for the melody on the second to last song, but nothing to do with the egotistical self centred lyrical gash that filled the rest of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rubbish, a rip off, i want my money back- what a dissapointment.These guys obviously needed the moneyand have discredited themselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Daft Punk fans deserve an explanation for this crap. Any excuse will do; contract fulfillment, they totally forgot they had to record an album until the last two weeks, something. An album like this, especially after the brilliance of Discovery, is inexcusable. Every single song on this album is underdeveloped, and some of them are just plain terrible. Maybe this album is supposed to be a joke, who knows?. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dandy Warhols bore me with their self-important, ultra-Fonzie approach to pop music. Those who don't know any better will eat this garbage up. So in other words, they'll sell the hell out of it. Way to go Arthur! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It has bad elements of both current and past music. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried my best to listen to the whole cd but i couldn't. it's a disaster. what happened to this band. they had "Celebrity Skin" but now with "Nobody's Daughter" i think it's end of their career. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a dude who can really sing he has sure managed to put together a cd of garbage. Everything sounds like they are trying way too hard to have a hit single. An over-produced mess without one solid song. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the first CD I have heard this year that I really consider terrible. It was incredibly annoying even on the very first listen. In general, I dislike when people write bad reviews, but folks need to know to avoid this one, and hopefully they'll turn it around with the next record. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. I was a big fan of Jurassic 5, but what a disappointing album. They need to get Cut Chemist back and forget about going pop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pathetic attempt! I was going to give it a chance being a moderate voter ... a daily show rip off that doesn't even give the daily show any street cred. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I chuckled once or twice. I like to watch funny people making fun of liberal shibboleths. These are not funny people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

O or 10 depending on your politcal affiliation? Not likely. I've been looking at the reviews all over the web and guess what? The 10's are EXACTLY the same comments on other sites. If your going to try to hype your show don't be so obvious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give it a 2 for the 2 funny jokes, but that's because I feel bad for them. I hope those anchors will be able to find another job...doing something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's comedic about this: Apparently Al Gore's son's drug use is the result of a traumatic experience from his childhood (his parents kissing). How is that humorous political commentary? Marching to the same drum of Ann Coulter's dead son comments about John Edwards, and Limbaughs family dog comments about Chelsea Clinton, this show avoids issues and just takes shots at irrelevant things (family, looks, appearance). But hey with the right doing such a screwy job with the county, what really do they have to joke about? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, I watched the whole thing, which was hard to do, but I wanted to be fair and give it a full chance. I am giving it a 2 (as opposed to a 0), because I did smile ONCE. With better writers, this show MIGHT stand a chance, but as of this pilot, it looks pretty grim. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The satire is pedestrian and lame. It's "Weekend Update" at its very worst. It's very sad to know that people actually think this stuff is funny and that this show is getting good ratings. I knew conservatives had bad taste in comedy, but not THIS bad. Along with "Red Eye", another example of FoxNews' decline. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this is an awkward, desperate and ultumately woeful attempt at political parody. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

relegated to the hellish hours of 3AM and plugged between other boners like Girls Gone Wild and Enzyte, it might do wonderfully. Some of us get punchy enough to laugh at anything, even this, at 3 AM. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

(2) for concept, (0) for execution, neither news nor entertainment 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sophmoric, ancient jokes given a "new" spin. If it was remotely funny, why the canned laugh track? Seriously. Don't get too fond of this show, it'll last maybe two weeks before Fox puts a bullet in its head. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man I am really disappointed in this show. I watched really hoping that I would finally see some good comedy about thos lefties and what do I get? Coulter trying to be funny. I like her rants about liberals just like the other guy but come on. She is not funny. I just wish we could be a little more original. We don't need to copy the Daily Show. We can do better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching this show is like watching two actors who hate each other in real life try their hardest, and fail, to keep it offscreen. There is no chemistry at all between the leads, or any other characters for that matter. The series has yet to produce a compelling villain and, instead, gives us more of an obsessed schoolboy grown up, but none the wiser for his many failures. The cliches abound and the dialogue is most painful when Beth and Jack spitball psychobabble back and forth like they're selecting from a menu of labels. For a series so heavily invested in pretending to psychoanalyze the motivations behind stalking behavior, not a single instance of that can be found. They throw fake psych diagnoses around and that's the extent of it. The show definitely reeks of something, but it's not so much misogyny as it is a complete misunderstanding of the subject material. The strange thing to me is that the show seems to have all the pieces there, but so woefully misuses them that it should be criminal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While some people may be offended by the story lines within this show, my problem with it has definitely been with the main characters. The story lines, while dark and often depressing, seem genuine and are eye-opening. The main characters, specifically in their male - female interactions completely let the show down. Instead of an interesting and dark drama the show becomes an hour of interesting stories interspersed with un-watchable misogyny from the main male character. A real let down of a show I wont be watching anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The scenes are same over & over with commercials every 5 minutes to change the channel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It has an appealing story and compelling characters. However, the villianization of people of faith is purely insulting and wholey foolish since, according to a recent Gallop poll over 90% of people in the US believe in God and over 60% attend or belong to a church. Clearly the writers of this program have an ax to grind against Christian and unfortunately that got in the way of any good the movie might have been. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Category 7 is such utter crap it's beyond explanation. Even the special effects portions are just crap. The guy who was practically dead in a full body cast is now throwing objects and carrying people. Just crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a scifi movie this was pure crap. However as comedy, this was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time! My two boys and I laughed and made fun of it for the full two hours. It was like MST3K in the comfort of own couch. It that SR-71 still flying around up there? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To call the acting in this movie "belabored" is a compliment. A for the stars, Gershon is on the edge of losing control from her appointment to head FEMA throughout the first episode; the air of desperation is unrelenting and she is not skilled enough to prevent its becoming tiresome. Cameron Daddo, Gershon's co-star, is equally unappealing as a maverick weather guru whose family portrait should appeear in the dictionary next to "dysfuntional." The rest of the cast comes off as slightly bored, with the exception of the ever-bombastic Randy Quaid, who spends the movie dashing around America sniffffing out bad weather. The story line is a mishmash of every bad disaster, hostage, and political intrigue film ever to air on TV. Save yourself the pain; watch CSI reruns! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a 2 based solely on some good looking actresses. I started reading all the reviews while I was watching it. I was googling Suki Kaiser. who played "Gayle" That's how bad it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So ridiculous, it's almost hilarious. I laughed out loud at the most serious moments. It is a caricature of a caricature of a caricature of itself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think ABC is suffering an identity crisis.  Is this really the same network that has the truly excellent Modern Family and the charming Suburgatory?  For the record, I did like Man Up, the show this one replaced.  Came into it fairly late, so I'm not sure if it got better as it went along.  Was disappointed it didn't find an audience though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not funny waiting for it to be funny never happen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's funnier than i thought it would be... which isn't very funny at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. Simply Terrible 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just not funny. At. All. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watched this nonsense because I was waiting for someone, and still felt as if I wasted my time. Long and tedious set-ups to get the actual wedding crashing, in which the payoff is just not worth it. The 2 points go to some of the actors who do make an attempt with decent comedic efforts, but are just overwhelmed by the poor format. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I felt like I was watching a show that even the CW network thought was too dumb to air. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has a lot in comparison to the new one. They both are just... not funny and just plain unoriginal. Filled with plot holes and clichés, this Uncle Buck is also not worth watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Randy Spelling has his own reality show? Randy Spelling? Seriously? It was almost so bad that it was good. Almost. Do TV execs really think the American public wants to see a bunch of guys with no viable talent and abrasive, annoying personalities living the highlife and screwing hot chicks courtesy of their wealthy and famous fathers. How can you not resent these pathethic losers. Hey Randy, what's up with the capri pants dude? And Sean, make sure you take your anti-being-a-psycho-douchebag-medication. The only thing more pathetic than this show is me for taking time to write about it on the internet. I need help. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sean Stewart is one of the most annoying people ever 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I mean really...how tough is it reason out that the gal in the cowboy hat is a professional rodeo rider? Yet, we have to spend an excruciating amount of time listening to people reason through that. And, I wonder, how long it took to find contestants who couldn't recognize Bruce Jenner or the Beaver. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The music is from the wrong decade, the dialog doesn't work. It's like the town had all taken trained with the Verbal Advantage. A pretensious writer and photographer got together with a cluless producer and was directed by someone with no sense of time or a grasp on reality. It's a failed attempt at the series for eveyone from 6 to 60. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pilot was pathetically predictable and loaded with cliche after cliche. dialogue was awful. The only thing this show has going for it is its shot in town with pretty homes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cringe-worthy dialogue, unlikable main character, predictable, cheesy and asinine storylines. And it's all been done before. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought computer graphics were better these days. The only reason why I watched it was because Tony Almeida was in it. The lines were so cheesy that I almost thought it was a comedy rather than an action film. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's sad in a disaster movie (or in this case, a "TV" disaster movie, Brilliant!) when the real disaster is the movie. It's true, we have a disaster movie so horrid that it makes "Asteroid" look like a classic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rated this as a 2 since the camera work ruined it. It seemed as if it could have been a good movie, except the zoom in, zoom out was horrible; it was not natural. No one ever moves in then moves out when talking to someone. The first time this movie came out, I stopped watching it after 15 minutes. That was all the time I could bear with that camera work. It was making me sick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Views should either keep track of the disaster-movie cliche's or the number of scientific impossibilities. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's a problem with having a sequal two years after a "part 1"... the actors have eaten bags of hohos in the meantime. 10.5 part 2 supposedly takes place within hours of part 1, yet no one can explain how the charactors played by Delaney and Cubitt have mysteriously gained about 15 pounds each - within hours. The actress who plays the Presidents daughter (she's so bad her name eludes me) - my god, how can anyone act this badly and be allowed in front of a TV? She looks like she's about to have a nervous breakdown with each line she reads. The last "oh geez" moment is when Cubitt's charactor decides to get himself killed by hovering no more than 6 inches above boiling water behind a dam, oh, and then hovering 2 feet *in front of* that dam that 's about to burst. Cheeeeeseyyyyyyyy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This movie is one of the best unintentional comedies I have ever seen. Love the scene in the first part where the woman from FEMA, trying to prove her FEMAness after being dissed by the man, tells the guys in truck COME ON, lets get this truck unloaded. Evidenly they were all sitting around in a disaster area with their fingers up their behind wondering "duuuuh what do we do with these vital emergency supplies? Leave them on the truck?" I almost gave this film a ten for it's humor value 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I want one of those 1400/mph choppers so I can hop off to N. Dakota or Texas like I'm going out to the 7/11. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think the show is a trick on us...I think everyone IS an actor. In fact, Jonathon definitely is. He even appeared on a recent episode of King of Queens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jason Mann is the type of person you want to see fail, but I am not about rooting against the movie because it involves so many people that rely on it's success.  In the end, the movie failed for me.  I do not live in that world and can't relate to the characters, but it is the director's job to get me to care.  Mr. Mann is too self-involved with the look of the picture to see that the characters are not developed enough.  I enjoyed watching Project Greenlight because of the drama that was built up each week between Effie and Jason.  If I was given the opportunity that Jason was, I would have been very humble in my attitude going in, and quite thankful of all the people involved with the project.  I do not believe Effie came across well at all, but Jason's unwillingness to recognize her job, was the catalyst to her attitude.  The movie was not funny, was not fun to watch and for Jason, and only Jason I am glad it failed.  I hope if he ever gets a chance to direct again he will see the error of his ways, but he will have to improve himself as a person first, and that is a project that will never be completed.

The senator's daughter Fiona played by Bridget Regan was the only light in this dark comedy, but I was disappointed with her choice at the end, and that made me very glad when the credits rolled to end this mess.  This movie had me believing at times I was involved in the aristocratic world of one of Robert Altman's movies.  I am not a fan of Altman's either.  I am a blue collar guy who does not dream to be in that world, yet in this "comedy" I was ready for that world to be made fun of, and it never happened,  Yet, I have enjoyed myself in a lot of movies billed as comedies and never laughed once because the movie was sound fundamental.  Seeing the crew in Project Greenlight laugh hardheartedly in pre-production, I wanted that too.  Now I am left to believe that the people involved in this HBO Project do not know what us as an audience wants.

That guy who made the mini-Jigsaw film was the right choice.  I laughed so hard watching that piece, I only wanted to see more of that guy's humor, especially along side the Farrelly Brothers, whom Effie pushed away.  In the end, the investment I made in watching Project Greenlight left me empty.  I hope the show comes back, but they make better choices. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched "Project Greenlight" about the making of this HBO film.  And it IS a film since Jason, the director, spent lots of time and money insisting upon shooting this thing on film rather than digitally.  Film did not help  I doubt that anything could have helped this waste of a movie.  That ponderous house they finally chose as their shooting location weighs down an already boring and slow movie.  The story was uninteresting and the characters were unlikeable.  Jason spent a bunch of time chasing down his excited picks for the two male leads.  Having seen the film, I cannot imagine why.  I would mention their names if I remembered them at all.

I really think if the director and the production people spent less time with their unending hugging on "Greenlight", they might have had more time to make a decent movie.  More like Lifetime than HBO. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best i can say about this movie is, i have seen worse. And the real crime is the actors have been really goood in other roles, so i know they can act. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There were a few laughs, but the first two episodes are a tired old version of the same old sit-com, repackaged and fed to us through the beer bong that TV has become. That, plus the ridiculous idea that the characters pictured would agree on the Martini (?) as their chosen group drink is enough to give any level of bar-fly the dry heaves. ANY bar conversation set to a laugh track would be as amusing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sucked... Not funny at all 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Remember the jokes Sonic makes in 06? Those jokes are funnier then every episode of this show. I mean come on! Really Ken Jeong? You were funny in "The Hangover". So whats your excuse for this mess? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh "Dr. Ken," how you try so hard to be funny and fail so miserably. Ken Jeong is funny, or has been in parts in movies and TV shows. But this show, where he's the lead and plays a doctor, isn't one of those times. The pilot was dull and sets up the series to be painful. This is a big miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What I learnt from this show is: Even though I like Ken Jeong, a comedy show with him is not a safe bet. Like, at all!
Yes, I like him, although his performances are usually over the top. He's been in shows/movies that were written well enough he could get away with it.
Not this one. I don't know how to say it in a polite way.
It's bad, it really is. I tried again and again, every now and then (that rhymes, I should sing it), but what I got was rarely funny. Call it stale, unoriginal, tired, it all winds up being: Not funny.

The show may have a strong link to Ken's own life, but if it is this unfunny, nobody should know about it.
Keep up the myth, bro! And I'm saying this the way Dr. Ken would say it, which is the way no one should say it.

I read that the show got renewed for another season. A true headscratcher. Makes you loose faith in mankind. I'll try not to think about it.
AFAIK it has a time slot before or after "Last Man Standing" with Tim Allen. Maybe there's where the magic lies. That show knows how to pander to a target audience. For five seasons! Well done Tim! And it helps Dr. Ken...sadly. You can help, people. Don't watch it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One point for potentially being a good idea and another for the coaches trying there best at what they were given. The show focused entirely too much on alcohol consumption. I understand having a drink, but getting drunk on your third date isn't very attractive. Whether they should be or not, teenagers were probably watching and the show portrayed that it was OK to make out or more with the guy the third time you've seen him. I know it is for adults, but I didn't feel that there was a good messge being sent (even to myself). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow is this show bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why are we surprised to see such a horrible show in an age where everyone wants their 15 minutes of reality fame? These female and male twits are getting way over exposed in this painfully dull dating marathon. Speaking of snoozefest, with all of the lip locking they have learned from the self appointed "expert" coaches, this cast of acting wannabes would do better performing in Sealy Posturpedic Mattress commercials than torturing us further with their romantic "woes". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dear Liz or Lohan, whatever your name is, I can't believe Liz & Dick is gonna be a Lifetime movie right now. It's too bad that I don't care and I don't wanna watch it because Lindsay Lohan is still a trainwreck. Wasn't she aware that she's on probation for some kind of burglary? I wonder if she's still high while shooting the movie. Anyway, how dare Lindsay to portray the late great Elizabeth Taylor and re-do the scandal that shocked Hollywood about 50 something years ago along with her ex-husband Richard Burton since their Cleopatra days. That was one of the greatest and most controversial love affairs turned scandals of all time. And now Lifetime is responsible to air Liz & Dick? Bring back America's Most Wanted for pete's sake. I got two words to describe Liz & Dick the movie: Craplicous and filth. And that's the reason you must avoid watching this trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is disturbing with its pathetic excuses for a joke. It's basically the show title, minus the "My Dad Says" part. Avoid this horrific show like your life depended on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Do you enjoy "Criminal Minds?" Would you like it better if the profilers were solving crimes in foreign countries, jetting around and wasting tax payer money to save Americans too dumb to avoid desperate situations? If you answered yes, "Criminal Minds: Beyond Borders" is for you. If not, avoid the stench of this tepid failure of imagination like the plague that it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show would be a whole lot more believable if David Spade's character was actually played by an ATTRACTIVE man! There is no way on earth that he could be half as much of a stud-muffin as he tries to be. Twenty-four year old woman finding him hot and thinking he's only 27?? Please... hot? Not a chance. 27? 57 maybe... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another pathetic attempt by FOX to fill out their Sunday night lineup. Bad jokes, bad acting, just plain bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You have Michael Rapaport in this train wreck. Did you expect originality? Of course not. His stand up is pretty much exactly like this show: worn out and not funny. I'm really surprised that this survived the hiatus due to the baseball. You would think this would have been in the canceled pile like pretty much half of Fox's creations. The kid wears a dress and the dad is a homophobe. He doesnt like his daughter dating thug mansion. Whew!! what creativity Rapaport has pulsing through him. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

painful to watch 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i watched a couple episodes of this show and it didn't suck COMPLETELY... but it still sucked. The script isn't written very well. I've written better and i'm only a high school student. This short review is probably more entertaining than an entire episode of this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh it pains me! I'm a fan of Parker Posey and I cringed through this whole show. I might try the second episode to see if it's any better... but I couldn't watch when it was first broadcast. The problem with the show is it seems like a sitcom that only sorta wants to be a sitcom full of talent who have no real experience in a sitcom - from the creator to the main two stars. There's so much talent here it was painful to watch how incredibly unfunny it was. You'd get the impression that Posey wasn't a great comic actress... and maybe not even a very good actress... from this first episode. We all know both to be untrue. The laugh track is absolutely horrible as well. Even when there were parts that made me slightly smile it was ruined by the riotous laughter of the laugh track. It was like being in a movie full of idiots who don't get what's funny and what's not. With some major retooling the talent here could possibly do something cool. I doubt they'll get the chance. If Posey wants to be in TV (and more Posey is never a bad thing) something playing more to her natural comedic talents would be much better than sticking her into some half-baked sitcom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a waste of Parker Posey. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That 2 is based on the leads only. I have nothing but respect for lauren ambrose but this show is shit, and the surregete mother story line in this show was actually on six feet under (were ambrose got her start!). What a waste of two fine actresses. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously.... no, seriously. I really mean it... what is the difference between Lifetime Channel schlock and this show? The predictable, sloppy, sentimental plot and lines in this show are made for the 'woman of the house'. Her agreeable hubby and 13 year old son enjoy for 2 other reasons. And THAT is where I came up with a score of '2'. Of COURSE she can't act... but who cares? Just Tivo and cut to all the parts she's flouncing around in that low cut nightie and all is well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The premise of the series is quite interesting, with a great potential, however, the show does not carry that. The corny writing along with effects that aren't convincing, Ghost Whisperer could not maintain a consistent quality to its plot. The show itself is boring and cheesy but you'd have to watch out on a lucky day where the show could potentially get better. It has good episodes but most of it isn't so great. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its so bad that it's good. Hense the 2. Between Hewitt's horrendous acting and the subtext of hearing the direction asking the audience to "Cry! CRY DAMN IT!!!" everyone should watch this show once. But ONLY once. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is why CBS is wack now a days. They let bad shows like this one into the world. I wanted to like Rob but man i hated it so much that i might never watch CBS again (Except: CSI Miami, Criminal Minds, & The Big Bang Theory). DONT WATCH THIS SHOW 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We've watched every season from the beginning.  There have been some good seasons and some not so good seasons.  This season, however is, hands down, the worst ever.  It's turned me off the show completely.  Big Brother is being banned from my PVR.

If you'd asked me last May, I might have even given this show an 8 out of 10, but after this summer, the only reason it has a 2 instead of a 0 is because of the 14 previous seasons.  The casting was just too horrendous this time around.  I couldn't relate to any of the cast and the ones that I could root for were still not worth much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really think this show had such great potential. I love seeing new creative inventions. Unfortunately, this show is more about sappy stories from people with BAD inventions!! The last episode a woman had a paper bed and they put her through? I'm totally serious about that one. The truly awesome inventions I have seen thus far were basically given a 2 second spot, maybe so that they would look fresh in round 2 of this bore fest. It's sad these people have had tough lives but you can't bring in a piece of garbage and call it an invention! There is no use for a paper bed...its already been freaking invented by hospitals. and by paper companies...GAWD this show so infuriates me! It could have been really freaking cool. For shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most predictable sitcom in ages. Nothing new comes out of this show and the laugh track makes me feel like an idiot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A terrible shame that this show is so bad because both of the stars are excellent and are very well cast. They put in the best they can, but the material itself is so unbelievably weak that it doesn't even matter. In the hands of a better writing staff and perhaps with a better premise this show could be fabulous, but at present I could barely tolerate a full episode. Quite tragic as I'd actually been looking forward to it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are familiar with the action/detective/adventure genre we know from classics like the "Indiana Jones" franchise or the franchise built around Dan Brown and perhaps the quite bad "National Treasure" franchise or "Lost City Raiders", there is little "The Last Templar" has to offer. Most of the mini-series I felt like I was watching a poorly acted, poorly researched, poorly scripted, poorly directed extended remake of "The Da Vinci Code" with a little bit of "Indiana Jones" thrown in the mix, that somehow managed to add a pro-Catholic message.

At the very start of the mini-series, I just new I was not going to like it. While there's an exposition of ancient Vatican artifacts being held in the middle of New York City, four men fully dressed in medieval Templar outfits are riding their horses through the metropolis, somehow not being stopped by police officers. Then they ride inside the exposition area after first decapitating a guard, steal a whole bunch of artifacts and ride off into the night.

The only valid reason I could think of why these guys would wear such an anachronistic outfit to go rob an exposition was if they were actual Templars in their authentic outfits who traveled through time, but this just wasn't that kind of story. The more I hoped for an alternative explanation, the more I got disappointed when it turned out they never even cared to offer one. We were told that one of the artifacts was a Templar artifact and one of the robbers was an expert on Templar history, but that's really all the clues we get on why the robbers came up with the ludicrous idea to use horses and medieval outfits. Did they really expect that anyone with more than two brain cells would find it remotely plausible that four men dressed as Templars and riding on horses rob an exposition of ancient artifacts in the center of New York City?! But let's not stop here. The Indiana Jane of our story (Mira Sorvino, why are do doing this?) runs after the robbers in her cocktail dress and high heels, steals a police horse and ancient pope staff in the process, continues to follow the robbers and then manages to knock one of them out in some park (Central Park?). After being arrested when taking an artifact from the knocked out robber, she's nearly instantly believed by the FBI agent that's put on the case who decides to let her go.

This pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the mini-series and the plot never becomes any more credible than in the first few scenes I just described. The foreign locations are hilariously unauthentic, the Templar mythology is childish, the events taking place are too contrived to take seriously and the main characters seem to make all the right decisions while at the same time coming off as incredibly naive. Besides our Indiana Jane's (actually it's Tess Chaykin, but I prefer to call her Indiana Jane) little daughter, none of the important characters seemed remotely believable in what they said or did. I suspect this indicates the mental age of the people involved.

Need I go on?! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is really bad. I hope this gets cancelled before all its episodes run. Garbage acting and even sillier tech (satelites zomming in rooms laterally!). Its silly plot lines are bound to get sillier. With a pilot thats impossible to stomach, this is truly the tv's e-coli. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it an hour and I was done.  I thought to myself, "Can I watch 15 - 20 hours of this over the course of a fall season?"  The answer was - hell no.  There's a lot of good TV on these days - too much to spend time on this stuff. Even though the leading ladies are beautiful - it's not enough to offset the blank stares, tired writing, and general blah. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remember sitting in front of my TV when I was in my early teens and watching the original. Sure the scripts were not always that great but it made up for it with the Beautiful chemistry the Woman had.Flash forward 35 years and you have evil Producers and writers who want to recapture that magic and they are way off.  The script was horrible and the acting was quite cheesy. Putting three Woman together isn't going to carry a show, you need something more and you don't have it here.Drew should have her hand slapped and so should the Smallville guys who created or should I say rebooted this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's easy to make fun of the Bush administration, but this show fails to do so with any sense of intelligence. Watching this show is the equivalent of being served a smelly, disgusting stew, and trying to pick the pieces of meat out of it. There's small bits of humor to be found, but you'll have to fish around the rest of the crap to find it. If you do fall victim to this show, fortunately the Daily Show is not too far after, so you'll have the chance to resuscitate the brain cells that made it through this gauntlet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I expected this show to be way better than it was. It's so easy to make fun of George Bush, they could have done a much better job. The sexual jokes about Barbara Bush were really painful to watch and just really gross. The only good part about the episode was the joke 'be nice to your brother, you might need him to help you rig an election someday' 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was too bad for even me to love, and I live on bad tv. HORRIBLE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Viewer wants to puke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Give me a break, this show makes Desperate Housewives look like a freakin' documentary. Two words: As If. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The acting is incredibly bad; the writing is sophmoric to trite. But somehow I still find myself drawn. It's like watching porn or something. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Better than "The Loop" worse than everything else on TV. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just looking at that image makes me want to hurl.  See this dude on Morning Joe every now and then - self-aggrandizing, etc. etc.  His show?  Come on USA.  You've done so much better.  Mr. Robot, Suits, Burn Notice.  Now Donny?  ugh 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. You've appeared in some great TV series, such as the ground-breaking "Six Feet Under," the classic "Law and Order, and the mishandled "Kidnapped." You even played detectives in two of those shows! So what are you doing in this stinker? Did you read the full script or quit after the naked shower scene with Karolina Wydra? How could you miss the giant swarm of hard-boiled detective cliches? The outlandish coincidences masquerading as plot? The unsurprising surprises? I can't believe you signed up for scenes like this one:

You and your partner are looking for a murderer who decapitates women. You trick him into communicating with you. Your trick is stupid and illegal, but people were a lot dumber in the 80s, not to mention high on cocaine, so it works. The murderer telex-invites you to an old crime scene, where he leaves a head-sized box on a table. What on earth could be in the box? The scary music starts up. The tom-toms of anticipation pound, as you stroke your vintage Don Johnson stubble reflectively. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE IN THAT HEAD-SIZED BOX?!?!?! (To avoid a spoiler, I won't answer the question.)

So, Jeremy, I'm afraid you'll have to resign your membership in the Cool, Edgy Guy Club. Yeah, I know: you thought a series named "Wicked City" might make you president, but here's a tip: if a show needs a wicked name, chances are the script is a little shy on actual wickedness. Next time, read the script. All of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wound up being one half hour of watching grown men whine, cry and (worst of all) try to be funny. Cook fans should avoid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dane you silly b****! This isn't good TV atl all. It's not up to your noraml rambunctiousness. it's like 'Hang out with me and my friends " and apparently hanging out with you and your transparently desperate friends is not as interesting as seeing you onstage. Just do your act and we'll be back. Otherwise, you will lose part of your audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dane cook is pretty funny. This show, however, is not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dane Cook is imminently watchable - this show is not. I'll give it one more try before permanently changing the channel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The dude who cried like a bitch the first episode should be forever banished from all comedy and the show itself is the height of lame-osity. Lame-ity lame lame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a freaking bore. Tourgasm? It's as lame as the name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

why in this day and age are you makeing the man a idiot,he must be really rich.a young girl can buy 500$ in clothes and he is good with this.once again the man say's no an the wife correct's him.it's called repetition.why can't he win .?wrong messege and not even close to real life.you have no ideas of the real impact you are doing.this show will not last.we are tired of rich.he works at a 16$ hr job unless bass pro shoppe pays more than me.crap and sad.this will not last. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I Agree with this person, this remake is a disaster, these actors have no chemistry whatsoever, the peformances are awful, the story is convoluted it makes me sick, Who in the right mind want to remake this great classic from 1987 and the disney movie from 1991, cause this piece of junk is no where near as good as those two.

This remake is a joke, big thumbs down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There is only one reason to watch this show -- to look at Kristen Kreuk. That's not good enough. Maybe if she went undercover as a stripper or something, it would be worth it. But no. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, it's a show about drunken college students, who do not happen to be going to college and are older than most college students.

What is the purpose of this show?  Surely it is not to be funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this show a 2 for the 2 funny lines in it. My fellow teachers and I were looking forward to the first show...the setting has so much potential. Sadly, we will probably not tune in again. The main character was tacky and immature. And...beer in a classroom? Playing golf in someone's classroom? Not even funny. Too bad...there are so many things that are funny that actually happen...why use something so lame and stupid? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Teaching is the family business, so it was with some interest I lingered after Scrubs to watch this. I only got through the first half. I wanted to like this, I really wanted to like this. But it seemed straight out of the hack manual of sitcom writing. There was very little related to the context of teaching, and instead filled with lame jokes, awful interactions, and inane writing. It was all the old tired 'jokes' put into a new context, but without anything creative, or new, or original. Frankly this show wasn't just bad. It was sad and it was actually a painful show to watch in how unfunny it was. This show doesn't deserve to be within five time slots of Scrubs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched it for a few weeks, and found the black-haired woman to be interesting and the least cartoonish actor. Unfortunately, during the episode with the computer golf tournament, they made her act as if she cared about the results, which destroyed any illusions I had that there was at least one decent character. Teachers aren't funny, folks; they work hard for little pay, and have to deal with spoiled kids with cell phones and weapons, not to mention the handicapped and language barriers. The truly, if not ironically, funny thing is that if the producers and directors went for more drama and less comedy, this might have become a good show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm blown away at how UNFUNNY this show is. No chemistry, barely any charisma, a whiny attempt to gather sympathy, and worst of all, horrendous writing. Puh-lease. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sometimes new shows are great and draw you in. Sometimes new shows leave you scratching your head asking what did I just watch. "Hunters" falls into that latter category. I watched the pilot. I'm not sure what it's about, where it's going, or why I would ever want to watch again. That's a problem. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring characters, unimpressive story line, a total disappointment. The main character is so unlikable that if they cut him out right now you wont notice. The plot thickens as it goes but it was not interesting to begin with. I gave it the benefit of the doubt as a si-fi fan but I cant take it anymore! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The opening sequence is completely enthralling and pulls you into the show.  Sadly, after that point one of the only bright spots is their use of music to create a mood of distress and unease foreshadowing the disappointment of abysmal execution of a rehash of multiple sci-fi tropes pulled from various shows over the last several decade.  The plot is utterly predictable and the acting is agonizing to watch.  The only character that comes across as believable is Julian McMahon's Lionel McCarthy.  The other characters are drab and forgettable.  There is little wonder why this show was not renewed for a second season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty god-awful - but I'll keep watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it doesn't quite rise to mediocre either. This review is based on the first half hour of the pilot, cuz that's when I turned it off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a piece of junk, gee lets do smallville meets Sliders and pretend its Flash Gordon. I am 36 years old and i guess i might have to wait another generation for somehow who to create a new version of Flash Gordon that works. Great junk sci fi !!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dale (Gina Holden) as the female lead would not have been my chose. A Flash Gordon with no piloting or fighting skills was kind of a major let down. Sci-Fi canceled The Dresden Files for "THIS". Maybe if you changed writers from the wrestling show this might at least be remembered fondly before being canceled. The new fall tv schedule begins this week and when it does this show is "KAPUT"! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So joyless. MIng the Merciless looks like a dyspeptic accountant and he runs and evil water utility. I've seen community theater manage better costumes out of the local goodwill. And "Flash" isn't an astronaut, or even a sprinter. He's a marathoner. But worst of all, no one on this show is having any fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Sharknado franchise stands as my all time favorite guilty pleasures and I'm very happy to report that The 4th Awakens continues the absurdity of what make these films so enjoyable to watch. Going even more over the top than the last, it's gleefully stupid and doesn't apologize for being so. It's without a 10/10 on entertainment but as a overall film, not to much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well for starters, it would be really nice since this is a show for kids if Jodie Sweetin would not wear tops that have her "girlfriends" hanging out. There's no reason for that at all in a show aimed towards kids. It's even distracting to the adults in my family as she looks periously close to a "wardrobe malfunction" Also I did not appreciate the "double entendre" jokes written in ostensibly to entertain the adult audience as well as the kid audience. We don't need that as adults....it is a transparent device and frankly, the jokes are annoying, not that funny, and sometimes actually cringeworthy. This show could have been an enjoyable reboot to people who grew up watching it, as well as a new generation. By trying to be all things to all people, mixing humor styles, and not allowing the main characters to coalesce without being interrupted every episode by prior cast members (no matter how nice it is to see them...but every time? It would be better just to write a couple of them in as regular cast members) I wanted to like it but it's frankly a mess and by stopping halfway between the original and between a fully developed interesting sequel that doesnt depend all that much on the previous show it's ended up unfortunately being mediocre. Too bad because I always liked this show, and the actors. . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has a laugh track. The acting is really bad. The scenarios are preposterous. I was unable to connect with or like a single character. The father figure is a white man trying his best racist Mexican dialect. Every "joke" was either obvious or cringe-worthy. Why are shows like this still produced? I was hoping the bland sitcom would die a horrible death with How I Met Your Mother. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never got to see the original show but was intrigued enough to watch as it was a Netflix original series but after 5 minutes I found it hard to continue to watch any more, although I made it through to the end of the first episode to give it fair chance. I never laughed once and only smiled through gritted teeth. The writing is not good and I can't believe that after shooting just one episode that all the danger signs were there to clearly see. Add the intensely annoying canned laughter and sadly you have something entirely forgettable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I seldom feel compelled to share my opinion about TV shows, movies, etc. but I was SO astounded by the HORRIBLE writing, casting, and limited acting ability ( Blair, in particular) that I had to research and see if other viewers found it as much of an insulting waste of time as I did. Most concur. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While I loved this Pope, I couldn't stand this movie. Biographical snippets with NO passion or reason to believe the acting. Horrible writing and ultimately BORING waste of time. Read a BIO on this Pope or go do something nice for someone in place of this movie. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fact that this is on TBS tells it all. Worst sitcom I've seen in years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Makes C-grade generic sitcoms like 'According to Jim' look like 'The Cosby Show'. It's not a trainwreck, it's just bland, unoriginal, dated and worst of all unfunny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe TBS would put this on the air. It's horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mildly funny...writing needs to improve. Most of the first episode was predictable and the only laughing we heard came from the laugh track. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved his show Episodes so I was really disappointed in this.  He played a wonderful role in Episodes, I truly thought he wouldn't do anything as bad as Pucks ( the tv show in the tv show Episodes). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was waiting for this to end from the minute it began. It's so cheesy...and it doesn't let Katie Finneran be brilliant like she usually is. This won't last a season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

About the only time I laughed was at the conclusion of the wheelchair gag. This show is another of those comedies that tries way too hard (i.e. Whitney) by inserting a gag into almost every sentence. I really thought I could relate to this after seeing the hell my  nieces put my sisters through but this is bland, humourless and just not funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Love Kelsey Grammer, but this is going to be an embarrassing blotch on his resume. They're trying to use Grammer's patented pomposity to play a kind of Jack Welch or Ted Turner who hits the skids, but here it isn't endearing, it's annoying and almost unwatchable. The rest of the cast is actually decent, but the tone's all wrong and the lines are out of the hack sitcom writer's playbook. Would have given it a lower grade, but it's not awful, just a pointless waste of electrons. Truly, this is electronic babysitting for people who go into comas after work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad writing. Overacted. Irritating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its  really dull and there's nothing new in it. Same type of characters we have seen in many other shows .It does not have any spark and i will be surprised if it continues for more than 1 season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's supposed to be a horror right? where's the scary part, and where's the suspense and thrill? except for the super dark screen all the time.
And what's the plot? what's the story here?
It was like when you go out of your house, get into your car and drive without any direction at all until you run out of gas. Then what? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Let's see if I have this right. Our hero, the Antichrist, is actually a pretty nice guy, as far as he knows. Unlike most people, he's managed not to notice his dark side--which, for a normal spawn of the devil, would be his only side--until the age of 30. Check. Then, after a "baptism in blood" so obscure that a journalist has to explain it to the class, he suddenly becomes aware that he may be "metaphysically challenged," which seems to involve being followed around by an old lady, some dogs, and a lot of wind. No decent powers, though, unless you count the ability to shatter statues of Jesus, which, frankly, most people can manage by natural means.

My verdict: if Damien is the Antichrist, I expect to sleep through the Apocalypse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unfortunately this show was horribly cast. The lead characters are caricatures of a lesbian, straight male, and the other woman. They all just miss the mark. So no matter how many jokes you put in their mouths, it just won't quite make it to "funny". In fact, the only Funny person on the show is the sister who's tucked away somewhere with not enough scenes or lines. The sister character "should" have been cast as the lesbian btw. It's too bad too, a decent concept, but a bland cast and no real edge or tension to the show. (See Modern Family - edge, plus tension, plus loving relationships equals laughs). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some good actors. Good producers. Mediocre to terrible writers. Production values have become next to nothing, a show is only as good as it's writing staff.( e.g. Friends exec. prod. created the awful veronica's closet.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If John Candy would be alive today, he'd be extremely disappointed with this attempt to bring the good old Uncle Buck together. I wonder if Mike Epps was living his life in a box for several weeks or so just for a role. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very open to liking this, as I enjoy Hospital TV dramas and see Melissa George as a competent actress. Her interpretation of the lead character turned me off majorly. It was overblown, affected, unlikeable. I will not be tuning in again, as apart from Dave Annable's Pierce, the other characters were not engaging either, though not sure if they were engaging it would make up for such a dislikable (not in a 'good' way) lead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. Just wow. I honestly had hope for this one.

Iron Fist is AWFUL. There are very few good things to say about this one. As a person who LOVED Daredevil and enjoyed Jessica Jones and (the first six episodes of) Luke Cage, I had pretty reasonable expectations, but this show couldn't manage to deliver on any of my expectations.

First, Finn Jones is horrible as Iron Fist, and no, it's not because he's white (I've never really had too much of a problem with that). He seems confused, his acting is mediocre at best, and ironically, he literally looks like he doesn't know what to do with his hands (er, "fist"). The show is incredibly racially insensitive and doesn't exactly have the best portrayals of Asians.

Rosario Dawson reprises her role as nurse Claire Temple, originally from Daredevil, and at this point, her character's sole purpose seems to be reminding us that these shows are linked together.

One of the very few highlights of the show was Colleen Wing (portrayed by Jessica Henwick). She's actually pretty good. Her character is really the only well-written character in the series.

The (few) fight scenes are incredibly dull and boring, and it shocks me to have to say this about a Marvel Studios property. They're unoriginal, underwhelming, and downright bad. The entire show is unoriginal and seems like a ripoff of every superhero movie ever.

This show is frustrating on every level. Finn Jones' portrayal of Iron Fist is a disgrace to the character. I honestly hope that The Defenders can manage to be better than this.

Seriously, if The Defenders is bad, I'm gonna start crying or something. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only reason this score isn't zero is because the plot has a beginning, middle and an end. I wasn't captivated by the story and only watched it all because it connects to other Netflix Marvel series. The dialogue was very amateur, characters lacked depth and were hard to empathize with. It is disappointing considering how great its Marvel predecessors were. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hey guess what, I didn't need a critic to tell me this was bad.  I witnessed it with my very own eyes and I'm sorry I wasted so many hours of my life.  How people could rate this show a 9 or 10 is far beyond my comprehension, unless those guys are being paid by Netflix to try and salvage something beyond help.  The critics are not wrong.  Boring, slow, offensive, whiny, dumb, pointless are just a few of the words that come to mind. I can accept a tired plot if done well.  I can even watch a dumb action flick with no plot if it has decent fight scenes and like them.  This show doesn't even have that.  Stay away.  It doesn't even need to be compared to any of the other Marvel shows on Netflix...it's just bad by any standard.  I haven't spoken to a single person I know who actually liked this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Understandably, there would be plenty of comic book fans rooting for this series, but after watching what was hyped to be a grand martial arts story for Iron Fist, I'm left scratching my head at its positive reviews.
I can't speak as much for it as others can as I could only get through 4-5 episodes before I realized I was bored out of my mind watching this.
The characters were boring and flat and it was hard to care for what anyone was doing except for maybe Wing and her dojo problems. Danny Rand just felt like a guy reading lines and walking through the city; any mysticism there was supposed to be was lost by poor writing.
The plot trundled along but had nothing interesting happen to our protagonist, except for the occasional run-in with thugs, resulting in stiff, poorly-choreographed fight scenes.
Who ever wrote for this series ruined it before it had even begun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel like several aspects of this show are actually not that bad, and certainly not as bad as some reviews I've seen.  While there weren't any particularly notable fight scenes, I didn't find the fight choreography, overall, to be noticeably bad.  The dialogue isn't great and the overarching plot is a little ridiculous, but, even with that, it's still mostly a middling quality superhero show.

I think the main problem of the series, which knocks it down significantly, is that Danny Rand just isn't that easy to root for.  He's oblivious and condescending and, at least once or twice an episode, he acts like a petulant toddler.  I get that his violent outbursts are supposed to be indicative of his mental state and frustration with his circumstances, but it's difficult to take seriously, since so little narrative energy is spent on even acknowledging that it's a problem.  Overall, he just comes off as an inconsiderate jerk, and it's tough to get invested in his journey, which is especially tough since his journey is the whole point of the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was much better when it we saw it as Batman Begins.  Heir to a billion dollar company is missing for years, trained by warrior monks and returns to the big city to fight the corruption that has taken over in his absence.  The two origin stories are identical with the exception that Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne as emotionally broken and tortured with great rage just under the surface.  Finn Jones as Iron Fist is an  annoyingly smug, irritating little millennial snowflake that embodies the worst of that generation.  He has this sneer like he is always the smartest guy in the room and he has some inside joke with himself that everyone else is an idiot.  He is also a hypocrite--repeatedly denouncing material wealth while at the same time hiring legal aide to get his share of the family fortune restored to his name.  Which is it?  Money bad or money good?  Even the hokey fight scenes are lackluster when compared to the likes of Daredevil and Luke Cage.  The glowing fist is a gimmick and allows our curly blonde surfer hero to end every fight with one SUPER PUNCH.  Which begs the question, why didn't you lead with that?  Because it ends fights too quickly and none of the hapless punching bag henchmen have any way to counter it.  I will probably continue to watch because it's Marvel and Marvel is like sex--even when it's bad it's still pretty good.  But the casting of Finn Jones was a mistake and the writing is limp and lazy.  This a big missed opportunity for Netflix.  I hope they can turn it around and mature Iron Fist into something less arrogant and snotty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Besides the excellent cast (Tony Pelphrey has just too good acting and Jessica Henwick astounds in every aspect), Iron Fist sucks. I'm so sorry to come up here and say it but there isn't any other words to put it clearly.

You don't know who the fact is the villain, if there's really a villain in this story. I know it could be mature if it worked correctly but in this storyline, where everything is about what is wrong and right, it just doesn't work. This series could use some great villain, with some badness, ugliness and power.

Madame Gao is a good villain, but her plotline is unconclusive. She jokes everyone, she is immortal, she is a drug dealer and she can use the chi (better than Danny). SHE IS A **** BOSS. But then she is just aprisioned by the Hand (a organization where she has some kind of leadership) in a room and isn't abble to be rescued by the Hand (HER Hand) and she also isn't abble to kick the door off with her power.

The Hand itself doesn't work well. It's just a bunch of teenagers trying to be sucessful in life: what is wrong with you, Danny??

Daredevil kicks drug dealers asses, Luke Cage tanks a lot of bullets (specially from the police) and Jessica Jones drinks a lot and still have the time to save the city from a freaking crazy mastermind controller son of a **** (Luv U Killgrave). Danny can't do anything like that. Coleen is the real deal here. She kills the leader of the High School "the Hand" Musical. She is the one who has a katana and DOENS'T LOSE A FIGHT. WHAT A BOSS, I say.

The other villain, the last villain, the main villain. Harald Meachum. What can I say? He is the worst villain from the Netflix superhero series. And any other superhero from Netflix (AKA Jessica, Luke or Matt) would beat the **** out of him, without being hit by a shot.

Not even the fighting scenes are really cool. They're just generic. The kind of thing you can see in Arrow or Agents of Shield. It would be nice to see some chinese coreographys and mistic things from chi and Kun-Lun, but in the end I kept caged in business bull**** and familiar tragedy 80% of the time.

Disappointed. Just disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The clunky dialogue often creates the sense that the show doesn’t trust its audience. ... Everyone fights the same, and no one looks interesting doing it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Were the writers drunk when they made this? Probably yes. Iron Fist lacks coherence, good action sequences, decent character writing and last but not least, the visual effects are just sad. Bad move from Netflix 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Pepper Dennis" is the most ill-conceived television fare since "House of Buggin". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The role of Laura might be cute if her kids weren't little monsters from Hell who never get punished for anything they do, if Laura didn't abuse her roll (returning a used swimsuit, yuck; lying to the neighbor about his broken window, no), and if the writer's used a bit more intelligence in the plot lines.  Debra Messing is great with what's given her, but it will take more than her to make this hot mess work. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave that show 2 episodes to be somewhat fair with my verdict. And it's out: It's no good.
There are 5-6 main characters in this show and only 2 of them are modestly funny: Anthony Anderson and Tempestt Bledsoe. I was really glad to see her back in a TV Show.
She and Anderson do what they can, but there's just not much comedy there.
I don't know the other actors and I can barely see any comedic talent in them. Or is it just the writers fault?
Anyhow, the plots are generic and we've seen it all before: Forgotten wedding anniversary, one of guys doesn't get recognized by a woman he used to date, two kids are always on full throttle at home and tear the place apart, blah blah blah, yawn.
I'm sure there are many good and funny stories that can be told about fathers who stay home with their kids and the mixed feelings they the former have towards the latter. But the writers apparently can't come up with one of those stories. I say, just skip this one, it will be cancelled anyway and I'm sorry for Tempestt Bledsoe. She deserves a better show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hate it...I bet (Garrett is kickin his own ass right now for NOT doing the "Raymond" spin-off...i laughed once during the Pilot...it wasnt even a laugh...it was like a chuckle...it was the only funny part not on the promos nvr watched it again... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show looked lame when I saw the previews for it but I gave it a chance since Brad Garrett is one of the stars. Boy, did it stink! We've heard these jokes before on unfunnier shows. I give the show 2 months before it gets pulled off the air. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't remember why I ended up watching this show (is it on after something good?), but after watching one episode, I have absolutely no interest in watching it again. Even the jokes during the promo commercials aren't funny (except the wedding band/quarters thing), which is a really bad sign. Not only are the jokes horribly predictable, they're repeated ad nauseum to attempt a Seinfeldian catharsis; problem is that the jokes are neither insightful nor funny. If this show makes it into a 2nd season I will be extremely shocked. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is an awful show. Terrrible unfunny jokes throughout the half hour of torture. Painfully unfunny writing and some cringe inducing jokes. Come who really thought this show would be good I mean it's FOX the master of shit sitcoms. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Language, sexual content turned me off. Had some funny parts, like his old self on Raymond. Did not feel comfortable watching this with my 15 yr. old son. Had to turn off when guy begins gyrating and talking about doing it on the new pool table. Read preview for following week and took off my Season Pass. Sorry, was hoping for more than this cheap trash! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A standoff every week? That'll wear thin pretty fast. With such a limited premise, the show will be a bore within weeks. I doubt this makes it to the winter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the first episode and looked forward to more. But then the next few ones came and I've stopped looking forward to any more. Badly written, badly directed and just plain bad. Fox seems to love these kinds of shows (cheap?). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so disappointed with Rosewood after the advertising and looking forward to a great American series which im a fan of.
Bad script, Too much storyline darting about and should focus more on Rosewood and 1 partner and either sack or teach the black lab assistant to act and talk slower and less voice pitch so I can actually hear what she says otherwise I miss the storyline. It may settle down but an opportunity lost for me im afraid. Hope the actor appears in another show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've never seen such an ambitious project failing that hard. Honestly, that's just terrible and ridiculous. In short, this pilot left me with an impression of amateurism: it's poorly acted (we might sometimes believe it's a joke from the actors, really, it's a disaster), insipid, predictable and seen over and over again. Just bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I take no pleasure in being right about this show.  The fact that it was shunted to a late night slot after only 2 episodes (I'd predicted cancelled after 4) at least gives my critical faculties some bolstering, finally!

But a lot of people seemed to really enjoy this show (I think the 10s are pushing it a bit though), and it is truly sad when a source of entertainment is lost.

I'm happy when someone derives enjoyment from any medium, no matter what I may think of it.  It is their choice:  I don't have to watch, read or listen to it, and I would never say 'I'm right and you're wrong.'

I didn't like Do No Harm at all, and it's still a 2 for me but, for the sake of the fans, I hope it gets picked up somewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've been watching Vamp shows for over two decades...this one won't make it. It's already given away most of it's secrets, and those that remain are pretty guessable. They should have made him older, and given a REAL reason for him to be trying to be 'good'...then they should have kept his 'secret' at least to the end of the first season! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

O'Louglin is not at all charismatic and the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not very engaging. Pretty good special effects and cinematography. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is bad so very bad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At first I was pretty excited to watch the new comedy "Mulaney". And then I watched the first episode it was not hilarious most of the jokes I couldn't  make sense of and the others were not funny at all. The only funny part , was the problem B***** guy when he got on the boat to do a gig. And the other one was the ex-girlfriend that's basically it and all I can say about Mulaney. :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything about this was awful. I don't think I even smiled at any point while watching the pilot, let alone actually laughing. Not really sure what NBC was thinking airing this or ordering the pilot to series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's a total rip-off. A Revenge/Scandal/666 Park Avenue rip-off. I don't why ABC is keep giving new shows that no one really cared for and let them watch the MLB postseason instead and hopefully wait for the World Series. Last Spring they cancelled Red Widow, now it's time for Betrayal to get Betrayed and never survive in the ratings and then gets the axe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give this show a 2 instead of 0 because it does have a good premise. The acting is weak, but could get better. The action, well, I guess I can say it is also weak. I've only seen the first two episodes and in those two episodes you have a bad guy on fast motorcycle getting passed by good guy truck that is off-road which proceeds to try to block the motorcycle by stopping in the road directly behind some strangely fallen tree branches and trunks that make a convenient  ramp for it to jump the truck. I could go on but it is much the same. I don't expect this to go far. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fun of the original show was it's unique character, MacGyver.  The guy had an almost superhuman ability to use every day items to create high impact solutions. This new show is exactly like every other procedural on TV: 1.  another team of folks in some special covert government agency (there must be a zillion of them) with no clear overall purpose 2. the team has the techie, the special ops guy, the understanding boss who lets them do whatever they want and MacGyver. Not sure what MacGyver is supposed to bring to the table here. His ability to transform every day items is limited, mundane and not used very often.  The chases, explosions and systems tech take over the show. The plot and script of each episode could easily be interchanged with that of a dozen other shows .  A major disappoinment. Watch reruns of the original show -it's more entertaining. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some reooted shows work and some don't, this does not. To capture the greatness of the original, a new story line is needed, not just rehash the old ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with the other negative comments. I was really looking forward to this "conspiracy" type show and it's really not. I can't get into the main character (Anthony Edwards), either he's wrongly cast or he's not as good of an actor as I thought (good ole ER days). Sad but true. But of course that's just my opinion at the end of the day. There are tons of better shows out there so I'm not going to waste my time on this one and I'll be surprised if it lasts. Hitler type stuff usually doesn't.... Unless your Indiana Jones! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm okay with outlandish stories,  I kind of like the story line, if a little crazy, The acting however is horrible,  who did the casting, Anthony Edwards as a Nazi Commander, or Christ's Chosen,  Come on.... its like William Shatner held an acting course, "The early years"  Painful to watch. I found myself wincing through most of it., won't watch again. Sad Sad Sad 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

bad writing and bad acting. i normally a sucker for mysteries kind of tv show, but the writing is so bad that you can laugh on it.  for example, ep3, the main char follows a lead from what he pick up from the ground. then the female detective call him on phone asked him where he is. he said 28th street.  then the detective ran out of the police station looking nervous and shouting right away  HANK" HANK".... omg, he just talk to you on the phone, u just cant wait until you get to 28th street and go nuts.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show just doesn't work for me. I find the characters unbelievable, and the story just seems to be going in silly directions. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The knives are out but it has to be acknowledged that 'Grace of Monaco' is everything that the critics say it is. Weighed down by the politics of the day, whilst simultaneously illustrating the inner turmoil of the princess herself, the dual arc of the story is unsuccessful on both fronts and ends up an excruciating bore. Performances suffer from miscasting, especially the usually reliable Tim Roth playing Rainier, and despite being gorgeously coiffed and costumed Nicole Kidman's portrayal is pretty but colourless. This is the actress's least effective performance in years. Her close ups seem to have been shot through gauze and continually draw attention to her blood shot eyes. This is a story that is so rich in potential that a good film could possibly be made about the fairy tale principality. However, despite some pretty music and the occasional spark of interest nothing can dispel the damage inflicted by a third rate script. It ends a being a prize turkey of the first order, ironically, lacking any grace. I saw it at the cinema (in the UK) about a year ago. However, its direct to TV American showing, in lieu of a conventional cinematic release, is not surprising and speaks volumes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the scriptwriters and producers are ignorant of the material they handle. the "show" is simply a vehicle for placing attractive actors in positions to deliver trite dialog. the show does a disservice to the military and the nation it serves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being a 80s horror fan. this show got my attention, but failed to hold it.  I got through the season, but only because I was watching it with someone else.  The music was good.  I was in my teens to early twenties when this was set.  I knew a lot of gay people, few were that out in the Midwest.  I don't remember any open trans-kids.  The show pushed a lot of today's issues, agendas & ideals onto a time when they didn't exist.    The acting, writing & effects, were horrible.  Any music used that hadn't been recorded in the 80s sounded like cheap, Cinemax soft-core, porn background music.  This was a flop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jenna good, Englishman good, Scott terrible, rest ok. story catastrophic, jokes old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bland show, no chemistry between jenna & josh. The plot is really thin and the jokes aren't that funny. Very predictable and tired of it already. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A 2 only because can watch Jenna. Othewise dull, and awful. I enjoyed Dharma much more. Finally turned the second episode off halfway thru. Very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I waited for months to see Kevin Can Wait because I think Kevin James is a phenomenal actor and because I love and still watch King of Queens.  KCW was disappointing because it didn't feel real, the fake audience laughter all through it was irritating and his wife really didn't fit with his character as well as the rest of the show cast.  I love Kevin and his acting but this one really needs immediate attention if it plans to survive.  I hope they fix it because I would like see some new programs with Kevin in it and hope this one will make it. KOQ was such a good and real show I really enjoy watching it.  Since they still use his brother maybe bring back Leah Remini??  She was great with Kevin!  Hoping for survival... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh come on!  Another older overweight blob husband with hair dye and a younger attractive wife?  Would be more believable if his character was wealthy. I'm a huge King of Queens fan and like Kevin James but I think I could've come up with a better sitcom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to seeing Kevin James in this medium again, I really enjoyed King of Queens, even some of his earlier movies. I don't know if the fact that Gary Valentine is there, but I really miss Doug. This new character is like some bizarro Doug, one I'm not willing to let into my living room every week. Give me King of Queens redux!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show could be better but it just isn't.David Allen Grier stinks as host and the guests they get are b level at best. you'll chuckle every so often,but for the most part its alot of Ummm ...uhhh....yes...yes..right.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dave Foley was pretty useless. I don't need someone to comment or interpret the jokes to me. I get it. We all get it. And we don't think it's all that funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad copy of the BBC's "Worst Week of My Life" (right down to the best man sleeping with the sister). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How such a talented cast can make such an unfunny show is completely amazing. The main character has the kernel of a good idea in there, but the writers decided to just make the show as bizarre as possible and hope that somehow the audience will think it's funny. It isn't. Basically an unfunny version of Rushmore. I won't be back for episode two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The whole thing is a horrible mixture of extreme obnoxious  behavior. The main character isn't likable. Not even funny, and story lines are AWFUL. Whatever look the show was going for, it missed completely. Except if it was supposed to be bad. Well, they succeeded. The only reason it gets a 2 is because 1) Believe it or not, it is not "THE" worst. 2) It doesn't deserve a 0, (poor) effort was put into it. 3) I laughed once. Just once. Comedy is supposed to be funny. What the hell is this???? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it was horrible, i can't understand why they allow a show like this on television...good plot, kept me watching but the sex is ridiculous!! i wouldn't want to find my 13 yr old son watching this, yet alone myself! too graphic, but then i guess thats tv these days... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The filming was superb but the show paints a black ugly picture of Hollywood. One I don't care to see. I don't enjoy watching people taking drugs ugh! Ian Hart was magnificient., award quality acting. Overall far too dark for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an incredibly lousy TV show. It wasn't even mildly entertaining. I thought the scenes centered around the schizophrenic character were ridiculous. I gave the show it's chance - watched the entire pilot. I won't be giving it a second chance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A piece of crap (or, in more relevant terms, "dirt") that takes itself way to seriously. It's desparate, dorky, and is in love with itself. Don't watch it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring Boring Boring
I love Michael Weatherly in NCIS so when I saw he had a new show I had to watch it.  Loaded up the on demand and tried to watch but this show is extremely boring.  I gave up and my wife tried to watch the 2nd episode and she fell asleep.  There are so many problems with this show.
#1. Nothing is happening
#2. You have no connection to any of the characters and hardly even to Michael
#3. The storylines are STUPID and you do not feel for or care for anyone in this show
#4. The idea that you can hand pick the jury and know what they will do is a sack of *******
#5. This show will be cancelled soon so why even bother watching. Just horrible

He either should have stayed on NCIS or he should have picked a better show to be on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so disappointed in the 1st episode. But I like Michael so much
and really wanted to like it, so I watched the 2nd. But I was still so
disappointed. I won't be watching a third episode.. I don't like his
image at all in the series, His personality is so bland and
emotionless. He's not positive, negative, funny, angry, caring, he just
comes across as dull and boring. The cast is also boring, the plots are
uninteresting. Wasn't there a better selection of series for him to
choose from. I don't know what else to say except I hope you get a new
show real soon. I'd rather not see this show drag out too long And
hopefully he will start a new series real soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched an episode hopeful, but expecting to be disappointed. Weatherly plays Tony DiNozzo playing a smarmy know-it-all consultant. I expect Mark Harmon will guest star and smack Tony on the back of the head. Then, in an oh-so-tired plot twist, his client is gay! Holy smokes, who saw that coming?
I'm appreciative when a series tells me upfront that it is going to advocate for Liberal politics. I can stop watching it sooner. If you want to hook me as a viewer, give me better script writing, a less smarmy lead character, and something not aimed to please everyone in Hollywood.

Hopes dashed. Expectations fulfilled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have watched a number of episodes now, and this week's was the worst.  About a woman who feels her husband was convicted unjustly of murder and decides to blow up Bull's pretend jury room.  Her criminal action then causes Bull to conjure up a mock retrial for the man, which all the victims participate in, until the authorities dig them out.  Bull writers evidently believe that no plot line is too absurd.  Such a shame.  Michael Weatherly's magnetism transferred successfully from NCIS to Bull, but the plots on Bull are just ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Show is lucky to be in the rocking chair between the two NCIS shows. Move it from this premo spot and it will see a rating drop. Not the best career move to leave NCIS for this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i kind of smiled once. every joke is either hokey beyond words or completely predictable. expected better from seth greene. he knows what funny is, and it ain't four kings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was ready to throw the towel in after the first 2 minutes or so, but thought I'd be a masochist and watch it for a little while longer. The jokes are incredibly lame and predictable. I would really like to know how the writers get so far as to be considered ready for prime-time when this stuff is so unfunny and sophomoric. I just hope some of the stink doesn't linger onto My Name is Earl, which is actually funny. Just skip Four Kings all together. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give it a 2 because it is a new show. The first episode was okay. I was willing to give it another chance. I had to stop watching during the 1st scene of the 2nd episode. Let's see, a female character refers to having her uteras scraped. Then the "kings" proceed to mention her uteras in obscene. My 14 year old son says it's a "guy show". I say Spike TV or, preferrably, off completely. It is demeaning to men and women. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't find any reason to watch this show. I didn't think it was funny at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As ridiculously beautiful as Denise Richards is, I have a hard time finding a reason to keep watching this show. No plot. No drama. Just circles of sex and backstabbing. Yawn 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show was... how should i say it.. STUPID!!! and I like reality tv shows!!! This is no Amazing Race. (Which is the best Reality/Adventure show on TV.) This show was so over produced and corny and stale with the fake video cell phone messages to the cast. And dont let me forget the way over acted and produced first meeting of the the two sets of five teams at the end of the first hour... how stupid looking were the casts facial expresssions... (oh who are you guys?... oh no! it's another set of teams.. this wont be easy now!.. (man that was stupid). I can just see the produces say ok you five teams run around this corner and then you five teams run around this corner and be surprised when you meet the other five teams. I Hope this show can show a little bit of imrovement in the comming weeks. I have more to say but I am done for now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Weak...No, weaker than weak. This show is awful. Whoever gave this thing 10's...obviously has a financial stake in it's success. Don't waste your time...ESPECIALLY if you're an amazing race fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is just stupid and really boring. THe amazing race is much better 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is just far too predictable, not funny and the characters are so stereotype that it's almost sad. A big disappointment as it was a great idea. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had hope that this show would be funny, but I was sadly mistaken. I don't understand all these comments likening this show to "Arrested Development." "Arrested Development" had interesting characters who were funny because of their ridiculousness. This painful cartoon has flat characters who mistake being crude with being funny. There won't be a second season. No one will watch this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just because it has a great cast, doe snot make this show of the same caliber as arrest development (where many of the cast members are leeched from). This is simply an awful comedy with nothing to laugh about except maybe the failure that the show truly is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In the last half hour, involving a dying character, a body part and a total disregard for the laws of gravity and physics, I burst out laughing. Other than that, this tedious talker had very little entertainment value. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awesome! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the most boring cliched pilots I've seen. No characters are sympathetic nor likable. None of the actors fit into their roles nor were they very convincing. BORING! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Virtually unwatchable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You lost me in the first twenty minutes. No story line could be understood. Too much superfluous dialog. A real miss 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Veers between stupid sentimentality and grotesque heroic posturing. Waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is dry boring and predictable... I hate how stupid these women are on the show... Savi is the worst... a whiny pretentious dumba** ...Karen is clueless and couldn't counsel her way around a corner... and Aprils storyline is 10 kinds of stupid...I gave it the 4 episode tryout and it was going well until eps 5-7 They completely lost me! The acting is atrocious in an unforgivable way... The story-lines are all super bogus and inauthentic...Why don't any of these women have lawyers or call police?? Its insanity...Watch Devious Maids instead for summer drama/fun... This one is DOA! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the first problem this show had was the casting. It's just so difficult to watch. The show is extremely boring. If you're looking for a new show to watch, don't waste your time. Skip this one, its really not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably the worst acting (male lead) I've seen in a looong time. So, so boring show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll be generous and give the show a 2 because I feel just horrible for the actors.  This is the most sexist show I've ever seen.  It opens on a man looking at women he's passing on the street and judging whether or not he would sleep with them: [actual lines: "yes... yes...no!... yes (but then lady walks out from behind a mailbox revealing a pregnant belly)-- maybe...(closeup on her boobs)--yes!"].  Cut to- girl walking down street, judging which purses she would buy.  REALLY, ABC???  This is 2014, for the love of God.  We see the love story from Dana's POV because Peter isn't interested from the beginning.  This poor girl only gets a date because someone begs this guy.  He mocks her on the date and she cries (because chicks cry, #amiright?LOL).  The friends make him apologize with flowers and Dana thinks, "flowers aren't gonna work on me--- oh, LILIES!"  (because girls are powerless when it comes to their favorite flower, I guess).  Blah blah blah, you know how this goes.  She gives him a third chance and he's all of a sudden sensitive and amazing.  And Peter's thoughts condescend, "this could work out."  And I'm like, "Nope."  Please, ABC, cancel this show and give these actors a better opportunity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this show reeks 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sadly, I hated it.  I loved the original tv version and really, really wanted to like this one since I really, really like Matthew Perry.  But I thought the writing was terrible, the characters didn't seem natural as if they were interacting in real-life situations, they seemed to me just like what they are, actors waiting for their turn to say their next lines.  Everyone seemed so stiff, but hopefully it was nervousness or that they haven't found their groove yet, so I will watch another week or 2.
Oh--and that laugh track.  I don't know why, but it was so noticeable.  A laugh track should be unobtrusive and add to the humor, but this laugh track was just to noticeable to the point of annoyance.  Maybe it was because the show didn't engage me that the laugh track stood out so much, but again, I'll try another episode or 2 only because I really like Matthew Perry.  He is so much better than this show----at least this show so far. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The problem with the show isn't just the stilted acting (which IS a major problem), it's that they try to take on the affectations of the characters from the original show. They should try to develop characters that suit their personalities, updated to the current era instead of the '70s.

The only thing new is that they make a lot of gay-bashing jokes in a crude and unsophisticated way. In the old series, I don't remember them ever stooping to that level because it was obvious they were both straight even though there was the definite "wife" role taken by Felix.

Then there are the sex jokes. Yikes. They're vulgar, and they make you really dislike Oscar.

Matthew: Loosen up. You don't need to punch every single word. Relax. Speak naturally. Oscar is a man's man, the kind you want to drink a beer with. Oscar's not the kind of guy you just want to punch in the face.
Thomas: A vest? You're not Tony Randall. Don't try to be.

The person who rated this a 9 must be Matthew Perry's aunt. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The decent cast deserve a better-written vehicle than this.  Here's a tip from the show-it-don't-say-it file:  find a way to make your main character plucky without sticking it in the dialogue.  The concept probably could have worked, but I don't see this getting renewed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a horrible show. It's so unrealistic it's sick, I actually had to finish watching the episode that I saw just to make sure it wasn't a parody.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is full of bad actors especially that dorky guy who wears his gun on his front pocket and the lead dude who has ZERO personality . . . the story lines are cool but that's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched this back in 2012 (it's now 2015), so my memory's a bit vague, but I do recall finding it inane, the kind of show I would normally turn off after 5 minutes. Why didn't I? I'm fascinated by the Cathars: what they believed, why their ideas were so compelling to so many and so threatening to the established church. I kept hoping for a shred or two of Actual History (not a lot, just a little taste) but instead endured yet another Holy Grail pursuit. Yes, yes, I know it's in the book, which riffs on the speculations of ONE grail-obsessed Nazi historian, but surely books and films have chased around after that damn goblet for long enough that I am justified in hoping for something just a bit fresher. Nope. Watch for the scenery, but keep a copy of MONTAILLOU handy to read during the boring parts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't believe the premise. A "Red Cell" would be too damned expensive. And scrambled off to solve just one child being kidnapped? Uh, I don't think so. Then there's the cast. Forest Whitaker is The King of Ham. Nobody emotes like he emotes. Particularly in real life. The rest of the cast? Meh. Then there's the plot -- recycled BS, recycled bad guy (he was the Bad Guy on Detroit 1-8-7 the night before -- he must be pretty popular in the twisted bad guy pool). As far-fetched as even the original CM gets, it's at least interesting. CM2, not so much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you think about it, it's pretty incredible this show even exists... What kind of parent would let their child participate in this? In a few years, once they've gone to college, seen a bit of the world outside their little pods, all the participating kids are going to feel really ashamed and pathetic. Other than that, it is pretty hilarious to watch and mock them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No talent, unfunny hack. The show is not even remotely clever. Why must he remind us every show how cheap the show is? Paper coffee cups.....yeah, we get it, Spike. I'm reminded of the phrase, "Couldn't ad lib a fart at a bean-eating contest." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another piece of garbage that makes a statement about race and class in Los Angeles, I so wish TV producers would get off the social soapbox and attempted brainwashing of the viewing public! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I generally enjoy hospital dramas and I love the high tech aspect of this. So we watched a number of episodes, really hoping it would work out.

It was awful.

The plots were cliche and the acting often wooden. Often it was about showing off their 3D printer without any actual thought involved. There were several times I was yelling at the screen because what they were doing made no sense at all.

But there was an episode where I finally swore I would never watch it again.

It involved a multi-person kidney donation swap. First, one of the staff members BADGERED AN ANONYMOUS PATIENT even though it would risk the entire groups of patients!! Why? Because she was nosy? That was just infuriating.

And then, to make it worse, another doctor PRESSURED AN ORGAN DONOR to donate an organ. This is just beyond unethical. And she was petulant and whiny when confronted. Her end result was "Oh well, I'm sorry I stepped on your toes" - showing zero remorse at all for her unethical behavior. And of course they made it the *female* doctor who shows this emotional lack of professionalism.

No no no. I will never watch this show again. It goes against everything I believe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have always liked Katherine Hegel.  That said, what happened?  Her character is so stiff and angry with little or no saving graces.  Too smug, too self righteous, too stiff.  I'll watch a series because I like the character or admire the character, neither of these emotions are felt watching this show.  It is ok to be strong and resolved but the likability factor is missing.  Come on Katherine, I know you can do better!  Smile as though you mean it, not as though you want to bite someone's head off and spit it at the director!  Show a little humanity! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Josh Schwartz is obviously tired with this one. The South is an interesting setting, but everything, from the lines to the characters, are hilarious here. I'll watch the O.C again if I need a shot of Bilson... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I absolutely hate this show. It's a normal teen drama, but set in a small town; really nothing special. The setting annoys me very much. Although I will say the title is clever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I highly recommend not wasting one's time with this show.  To be fair I have only watched the pilot myself so I can't swear it won't get better, but it didn't give any signs it could and one hour was an hour too much invested in this (and that from someone who watches several dozen hours of tv a week).  If you want to see a fish-out-of-water story about a New York City doctor adjusting to life in a quirky small town you would be better served to rent/buy/stream Northern Exposure.  This is my first review here btw so I'm not sure what constitutes a "spoiler" per se but I don't directly explain any events below so I didn't mark the article for spoilers but if you are especially sensitive to even oblique references to the sorts of things that might happen in the pilot and are intent on watching this show, please stop reading here just in case; I'm writing this to try to save you an hour, not to ruin anything for you (thanks/sorry!).The characters are shallow caricatures, character development is forced and awkward (the only vaguely medical operation in the premiere leads immediately two eureka moments from both the main character and the patient where they suddenly change life-long attitudes and behaviors without any explanation), though the overwhelmingly mercurial caprice of the characters might be exactly the catalyst for drama poor writing needs to keep things "interesting" (f.e. they create several situations in just the first hour that might intrigue people who are really into guessing who's going to date whom which is not my cup of tea).If they intended this to be a carefree heartwarming hour (which I can only assume from the lack of substance) they missed the mark on many counts and should have had a more sympathetic main character (or ideally the majority of the cast), a positive tone, and ideally some witty dialogue or humor (the only thing that I think was meant to be a joke relies on the viewer to actually assume the real Burt Reynolds would be randomly wandering an Alabama swamp on someone else's land in the middle of the night on a regular basis; if you don't accept that premise on its face, you won't be surprised and chuckle when it's proven false!). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another huge misfire from the Farrelly Brothers. It's hard to believe that these are the same guys who created "Dumb & Dumber," "Kingpin," and "There's Something About Mary." The gross-out humor is forced and there was no chemistry among the leads. I give this a "2" only because Rashida Jones is such a cutie. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Such a numbing an truly terrible show. It takes what could be a good idea and totally ruins it; if it were tongue-in-cheek or just funny in any way it could be good. Instead everyone acts serious like they're actually going to die and the acting is just painfully atrocious. Everything that happens is unintentionally hilarious: plot points, acting, writing, the reveals of how people die, and more. I watched it for about the first six episodes but then I just gave up because it was basically like watching paint dry, if the paint were somehow drying in a way that made you angry. I did, however, find out the end episode and it's just beyond stupid. I'm at a loss for words. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Old and boring
Even if the series is more than 20 years old and therefore you have to evaluate carefully. Visually, perhaps, she was up to date in 1994.
Everything that is shown there is today much better.
In terms of content, the series offers only average quality. Shatner would not have had to give up for the rubbish. The story is so thin that they fit on a DIN A6 sheet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

not even ok... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Eric Balfour is kind of cute... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although the cast and storyline have potential, the premiere was surprisingly bland and had no substance that made me want to catch the next episode. There were a few cute moments and a few funny lines, but otherwise, the show was tasteless and boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has few fleeting funny lines. Overall, not worth watching. Most people compare it to Arrested Development, which is sad, because AD was funny. The humour is juvenile and cheap, and the characters are uninteresting. Another show in a long line of swings & misses for fox. They should've stuck with Arrested Development. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trying WAY too hard. They swing a lot, and while they connect on a few, they miss on way too many. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The old, overexposed, boring laugh-tracked sitcom formula is here. And it isn't even the third biggest problem with Anger Management. It just lacks everything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having been fired from Two and a Half Men for, well basically going insane, Charlie Sheen soon found himself back in the lead role of another major networks sit-com. In Anger Management he plays an ex-ballplayer who ruined his career because of his temper and has now become a therapist in order to prevent others from making the same mistakes he did.

If done right this could have made for an interesting comedy drama but the writers have instead just used the set up to have a group of cliched characters sit around making depressingly unfunny wisecracks about each other and a host of social groups that make easy targets, something which is only made worse by the irritating laugh track. From the opening episode the lazy writing and phoned in performances make it painfully clear that this is nothing more than a money making exercise for all those involved as they hope to cash in on the audience Sheen attracted with Two and a Half Men (Itself not a particularly great show). The fact that the deal struck between the creators and network virtually guaranteed the 100 episodes needed for syndication from the get go speaks volumes really and, having watched the first three episodes, I'll not be giving this show another second of my time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To me, all of the attempts at humor(dare I call them jokes) fall flat. This show gives off the vibe of being written for mass-consumption by an unthinking audience that will laugh at anything presented to them. Most of the humor on Anger management can be summed up in this way: "oh look at me, I'm doing something strange,  time to laugh!" or a certain brand of humor that just oozes laziness. All of the jokes are extremely predictable to any discerning viewer. Charlie Sheen seems dull and uninterested and the rest of the cast give extremely mediocre performances. I give this show a 2/10 for somehow maintaining a person interested enough to point a camera at this travesty. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Some funny moments but the show seemed a bit awkward. I'll probably watch it again to see if I can get into it but so far, not too impressed with the writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's just tiresome. Charlie doesn't work as a lead character and definitely not as some chick-magnet looking as old as he does. It's almost as if he's perpetually stuck in some sort of mid-life crisis. Everyone else is just a stereotype and completely one-dimensional. They're constantly firing off 'jokes' for some cheap laughs, which are only provided by a laugh track. There is a lot of potential, especially with characters like Kate's fear of commitment and expanding the back story of the ex-wife and kid. Each other character in the group can easily be expanded on as well, adding some depth, making me believe they are actual people rather than cardboard imitations of them.

There is just no reason to care for what these characters are doing or saying. It's the most shallow series I've seen to date. The only reason this is on the air is because Comedy Central bought 100(?) episodes when Charlie Sheen was still 'a thing' during the final days on Two and a Half Men and his subsequent lay-off due to his substance abuse. There are better ways to spend your time than watching 'Anger Management'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

NBC comedy has been a wasteland for the past few years. With the exception of "Superstore," nothing has worked. "Crowded" follows that pattern. It's about empty nesters whose kids move back in. Hilarity ensues... except it doesn't. The show isn't clever or funny. It's boring and pathetic. Luckily, given the numbers, it shouldn't be on the air too long. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad bad laugh track. Totally disappointed by this show. Loved RC on Daily Show but this is terrible. Couldn't watch past the first scene it was so bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A total waste of a talented Cordry. Horrible. Cheesy.Awkward dated laugh track. Not a laugh anywhere. Make it go away. And Rob, go back to the Daily Show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I absolutely loved the first season. However, in regards to the second season; What the hell is wrong with these writers?
1.Terribly inconsistent plot: Every new episode completely changes the story line. I can only hope that it ties itself up by the finale, Although I am not holding my lack of hope to high.
2.Atrocious extra cast members: It appears with every new episode, the actors playing the supporting characters, which of whom have mainly only been featured in shorts, get worse and even worse. Simply to provide insight into my point I will list a few examples,
-J.D. Williams as 'Carlos'
-Camille De Pazzis as 'Giselle'
-Owen Campbell as 'Cole'
-Sprague Grayden as 'Carrie Cook'
3. Absurdly unnatural dialogue. If you have watched the first 5 episodes, The need to justify this point is irrelevant and unnecessary.
4. Dead give aways, Again if you have watched there is no need to explain.
5.Terribly predictable plot twists
6. Inconsistent Volume Calibration.
7. Can the person in charge of the music scoring not find another band or music that doesn't sound like Hinder or Theory of a Dead Man to wrap up each episode? Every time that **** starts I prepare for a horrible 'Cliffhanger' ending.
8. The writers addressed between seasons that the portrayal of the FBI's intelligence needed to be more realistic, Yet so far I have not noticed any leaps in that direction. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a HUGE Kevin Bacon fan and watched last season religiously. Unfortunately, they killed most of the characters I found compelling and intriguing. I've watched the first two episodes this season and just can't get into it this time around. I'm not as interested in the new characters. I'm also a woman and hated they killed off both Claire and the female detective - they could have at least left me with one strong, relatable female character. So disappointed after such high hopes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a mind-numbingly stupid mess. Any literate person should take it as an insult to his or her intelligence. It seems to be aimed at drooling, brain-dead yokels who've never read a single book on poetry or law enforcement or psychology or cults. And judging by its ratings, that's a disconcertingly high proportion of the American public. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Painful to watch. I didn't find it funny at all, and the jokes seemed to repeat (imagine what this show will be like by episode 10, if it makes it that far). Acting is over-the-top, as if that would make up for unfunny script. Devane, in particular, is annoying. Fred Savage should have quit while he was ahead and left us all remembering him from Wonder Years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought it was horrible! The laugh track was deafening, even after lame, predictable jokes. What a waste of talent. I'm surprised that someone as talented and classy as Jane Curtain didn't throw up all over the script. For a 'silly' comedy, 'How I Met Your Mother' is 10x better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main problem with the first episode of Black Box (I do not wish to watch more) is how everyone, even the character herself, is constantly talking about how smart and important Black is without the story giving sufficient evidence to show that this is in fact the case. In House M.D., everyone is also constantly talking about how much of a genius is, but the show actually demonstrates this idea by having more instances of him being a genius than instances of people saying that he is a genius.

What's more, the show seems obsessed with demonstrating that Black is very much a hip maverick with such a unique point of view. In one scene, when walking into her patient's room, she discovers two nurses trying to subdue the patient with an injection. The nurses explain that the patient is hurting himself to the point of bleeding so that he could use the blood to fuel his need to continuously paint on the wall. Although the nurses' decision to inject the patient to prevent him from further hurting himself is completely justified, Black scolds them and tells them both to leave ( because how dare they even think of doing such a thing!). Can't the audience see that only Black can understand the poor soul? Conveniently at this point, the patient becomes calm and is not hurting himself. Who knows what Black would have done if this were not the case.  Perhaps the show is trying to convey that Black's mere sympathetic presence alleviates manic episodes. It doesn't really matter because whatever the case, this scene was silly.

Also, at the only point in the episode the patient seems to have a hallucination (the audience can see the fire he sees), Black sees the patient slightly look side to side and responds "What are you seeing?" Aside from when he is cured and when he has a bout of lucidity, that patient is always acting "abnormal." Of course the one time he has a hallucination, while giving no clear indication of acting any differently from his usual self, Black is able to know that he is having one with such certainty that she asks "What do you see?" instead of "Do you see something?"

But perhaps the most cringe-worthy scene in the whole episode is when Black is walking on a beach, apparently suicidal, and calls her therapist to know why she shouldn't kill herself. The plot thus far had not at all built up enough reason for Black to want to kill herself. The idea that she doesn't want to be like her mom, being bipolar and having kids, was not being aggravated by the boyfriend/fiancee. The only thing he said about having kids was that although Black doesn't want them now "you may change your mind." He never said that having kids is extremely important to him. Also, the idea that life is mediocre when she is not bipolar does not seem to be the reason because she has somehow lived the last year problem-free, without going off her medication. She seems to go off them simply because she wants to, not because of some external pressure. So, her therapist on the other line of the phone tells Black to go on because her work is so important to the world. Even if this is the case, there's no way for the audience to sympathize with that because the audience doesn't know what she does. There's no lead to believe her work is important other than Black thinking it's true and people saying it's true. There's no indication in the episode that she does research or the like. Anything medical or surgical in the episode was handled by other doctors. All Black did was have unjustified, pretentious personal issues and appear in the hospital to be contrarian to the doctors who weren't blessed with Black's hip point of view.

There seemed to be no break to the mess that was Black Box. I would not recommend the show to anyone unless he/she tends to like these kind of series. The show would seem to appeal to people who see its pretension as inviting because doctors have to be smart to be doctors, and if doctors, even television ones, think someone is a genius, then the audience member watching the show is by extension glorified by recognizing that the genius is smart. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad show!! Bad acting and un-realistic stories. Just a bad show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

pathetic, unoriginal and bad acting. i'm tired of watching rich white people with problems on television. oh but wait, they have a black girl, whose is not part of the "20 friends" who won the lottery but won anyways. at least they have her as a special guest. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i was loved the idea.i thought finally a feel good show.i did not want another negative soap. i would like to watch and wish i was part of the action.i quit watching.i hate the new style of sitcoms-they are stupid and insult my intelligence. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is as hard to believe as actually winning the lottery is. Terrible twists and terrible acting makes for a...you guessed it, terrible show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

is it me or are almost all of the characters unlikable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just can't get into it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like most of the CSI shows and I really was excited for this one too, unfortunately I'm not impressed.  Bad acting, terrible dialogue and the casting of this team is off.  Not worth watching! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This sow is a bland mixture of the same thing we have seen many times before, but done worse. The stereo-types like the overweight computer guy, and the boss with a dark background.

The cyber seems to be just a weak plot point to have a car chase or a gun fight. No real hacking skills used. Sure they have some cyber ideas but on the whole not well used.

This show has been made before and this is a bad version of those shows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've watched every episode so far and intend to watch until it is cancelled - not because it is good, but because it is so bad. The writing takes the worst elements of crime drama and mixes it with bad 'cyber' cliches. The acting is so far below what even the obscure members of the cast are capable of it's sad. Unless they're being directed to act that way, in which case it's disgusting. While some of the characters seem to be getting better, you still have the writing, which is bad. I think Arquette's character is supposed to come off as cool and logical, but she actually comes across as cold and emotionless. Maybe even a little inhuman.

The shows one virtue is that is so ripe for parody, lampoon, and the MST3K treatment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked the original CSI in Vegas and I hope it isn't gone forever. I liked CSI: NY but it's long gone now. I had hopes for this one but I just can't get into it. The characters never seem to gel. They seem like a dysfunctional work group. Arquette's character seems like she's more interested in herself than building her team. She's grouchy but she's no Jethro Gibbs. If I were part of their team I'd be looking for a way to transfer out. Fortunately all I need to do is pick up the remote. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

pascal is right, it seemes staged and wasn't a good staaged show at that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i don't where the kids go to school but i definetly feel that there speech could be inproved. as for run and his wife he is always putting her down and correcting her is she stupid . i think not but why is she acting as if she is . i can't compare you to the cosby show because that was a sitcom .but if this is your reality you need to go to church more often show some charity . i still believe in the more you grow the more you owe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When Noah is telling the Book of Genesis to his family I knew this would not be good....and it isn't.  Everyone has a different accent....even Scottish.  Cringe worthy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hope it will be cancelled so Naomi Watts could focus on something interesting. Gypsy is boring uninspired fantasy of someone who reads a lot of blogs about psychology of relationship instead of reading legit books about the subject. The main plot about Watts character falling in love with some hipster girl is totally unbelievable, because the girl looks more like millenial caricature and not living, breathing person. There is nothing to fall in love with. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely garbage. The producer made up extreme to sell it but it still does not work. Things like diamond water or mama consulting are awful and does not reflect any level of  Persians community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shadowhunters scored the top for 2 years because of the books. Lots of people who read the books love them, until the tv series came out. It was and is depressing to see such a great book not be represented the way it should be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've read the Mortal Instruments books, I'm in the middle of the last. Since like, the first episode, nothing has been accurate. Not even some of the characters are portrayed the same from the books. all of the plots are 100% different and the acting is awful. The movie wasn't 100% accurate, but it was probably about 97%. At least they stuck to the actual plot of the first book, whereas this show is taking a totally different one. Don't base it off the book if everything is going to be different. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think we're just about out of gas with this YA adaptation craze. "The Mortal Instruments" didn't work as a movie, and now it doesn't work as a TV series. While MTV surprisingly made an engaging show with the "Shannara Chronicles," Freeform swung and missed with this series. The pilot was a boring, confusing train wreck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The acting and writing are really difficult to take with this series.  I'm currently reading the books and really enjoyed the movie.  I was hoping for so much more from this series.  I was very excited when I learned it would air as a series.  I have watched the first two episodes and they were extremely hard to watch.  The special effects seem to be better than the acting and storyline.  At this point, I'm not sure I want to watch the remaining episodes I have recorded.  Very disappointed with this!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh! All these doctors emote and worry about their feelings. I haven't seen so many men cry since the Toronto Maple Leafs did not make the playoffs -- again. Is all of California like this? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Kate Walsh is not very good and the show itself is just dumb. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very tried plots getting more boring episode by episode. Tonight was my last time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful and I LOVE Grey's. Shonda-shame on you 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

not as good as any other shows on tv. The acting is bad i am assuming these people are comedians? I think we should start casting shows with talented actors I am sure there are a lot of them out there in LA waiting for a show they cann sink there teeth into. The lead guy, Josh Dean is BORING!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadfully boring. Unlike the original, in the sense that all intrigue and charm has been removed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Should even have been called by the same title. A very poor story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An opportunity to produce a modern-day classic out of the fertile ground of the original series has been completel wasted by the writers and editors of this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The commercials were nice. The PalmPre girl. The Geico gecko. I don't know what all of that other stuff was. Something about a man running round aimlessly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When you sit down for 6 hours of something like this, you obviously do so knowing you're going to get something different. But with ENDLESS slow-motion shooting by the director used to AMPLIFY profound moments --- you would think he first read the script to see if THERE WERE ANY profound moments! Compelling portrait of command and control vs privacy and individuality?... no. Juxtaposition of simple life vs. complex noise and technology?.. no. Love story?.. no. Good vs evil?.. no. Boring, British crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ian McKellan can be thanked for my not rating this lower. The plot was complete disjointed and, in the end, didn't make any sense. I think they could have gone in a great direction, but the editing really hurt the show. In addition, this did not need to be six hours long. I think three would have been good, and extra characters could have been cut (the brother story line? I don't know what that was about). In the end, it just helped reaffirm that James Caviezel doesn't need to act, ever, as his shifts from stone acting to watery blubbering to soap opera seriousness just left me with a migraine. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pseudo-intellectual garbage with no meaning whatsoever. I only gave it a 2 because they had to build the village 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Â Â I watched with interest the three episodes of the show, but I was very disappointed with the representation of the Russian community on the show. I came to Brooklyn when I was eight and grew up near Brighton beach. I was shocked at how the community is being represented on the show. Yes we love to party and go to banya, we take pride in how we dress and look but unlike on the show , Russian American women work hard to succeed. I wish the producers of the show would have chosen beautiful, successful Russian girls that contribute to society i.e. The Real Russian Dolls.... Just for the record calling your your mother a b.... on and off the camera is never acceptable in the Russian community. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is a more boring version of "True Blood" apparently aimed at a younger audience with sociopathic tendencies.  I mean, that's why gore and sex are the show's fall backs, right?  It's too bad because they have a decent cast and the show is shot well.  The dialog, however, is forced and the story lines don't make up for it.  The characters are shallow and uninteresting.  Five episodes in I still didn't care about any of them.  There's a lot of sex and nudity, which I guess is supposed to make it feel edgy.  Instead, it just seems they're trying to distract you from the fact that NOTHING IS HAPPENING.  Well, that's not fair.  A lot happens, just not anything that you care about.  And the big "revelations" aren't enough to make you care what's coming next.  It's like someone wrote down every idea he got from a drunken binge-watching of "American Horror Story" and then hired the producers of "True Blood" to make this junk for Netflix.  Sure, my writing isn't great, but it's Pulitzer-prize winning material compared to this tripe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The story was confused, pulled in too many directions, and felt like a re-run of so many other shows we have seen in this genre. I feel the show runner had many ideas for this show and tried to use them all in one season. It ended in a big mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

dog sh!t would be too kind a description for this show. the acting is awful, the accents are unbelievable, the people are irrational. It's basically twilight the TV show (or what I imagine to be twilight the TV show since I've never seen or read twilight).. I couldnt take more than 20 minutes of episode one and was tempted to just cancel my netflix subscription in protest of this rancid manure

It's a sad showing that the  shown in the first 30 seconds are probably the best thing to come from this garbage 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sloooowwwww.....when we got to the middle of Episode 7 we just could not stand it any more and had to fast forward to hope to get thru the remaining ones quickly. We stopped at E10.

I got so fed up with this show that I searched the internet to find the ending before I went to bed. From what I read the ending left a lot of answers unanswered, guess to attempt to stretch it out into Season 2,3,4.....oh please, NO!!!! No more!!!!! How many more times do we need to see these characters having sex (not even good scenes), and listen to their same long drawn boring conversations?! This book should have been a two hrs show and that's it!!!

TO: TV executives, please make note that not every book or a show idea needs to be a multiple season show. Do what other countries do, create an interesting show that ends in six months, than move on to another story. When you stretch out a show by inserting reruns between episodes, and the audience has to wait five months for the new episodes, audience like us would have forgotten the storyline and lost interest with the characters to follow it further.  It is a big turnoff to look forward to watch the show and it turned out to be a rerun.Good example for us are: Once Upon a Time, Revenge, Lost...we have stopped watching it all together. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

@Woodsy - I agree, nothing grabs my attention, cliche characters and script. Roman Godfrey (Bill Skarsgard) is trying too hard to be Steve Buscemi, a la Boardwalk Empire. But he's supposed to be in high school. In fact, all the "kids" look too old. I'll give it one more episode, otherwise I'm out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had not watched HG up until July 2014. I was so eager to start watching the series after seeing the buzz over social media when Season 2 uploaded to Netflx. I just *forced* myself to finish Season 1 and what an unpleasant experience that was. I understand that a fair amount of gore is expected for horror shows; but much of it was obviously & shamelessly gratuitous. Having Peter's face eaten off, and having him return later with full face intact was senseless and did nothing to explain or enhance the story. Other explicit sexual imagery; such as Olivia fondling her son's aroused genitalia through his trousers was also irrelevant & unnecessary, yet the writers simply threw it in for no justifiable reason. I'll pass on Season 2. What a shame. It started out with such promise. It was so engaging at first, but then it took some sort of "sell-out" plunge, as if to cater to the worst, classless, basest denominator. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst thing that can happen in the horror genre, especially a TV series, is for it to bore you to death. Fans of Horror will not find themselves binge watching this on Netflix. Between the main character fighting with his lines trying not to let his true accent slip and the awfully written dialog I recommend users to stay far far away. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you start from a very poor idea ( a billionaire bribing a Mayor to take control of a police department) the development of this idea is not going to improve the final product. Bad and promising to get even worst. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never seen a show change in tone and quality so dramatically between seasons before Wayward Pines, and not for the better. All the intrigue and mystery from the first season is gone, coincidentally along with almost the entire first season cast. Yes, everyone you ever formed any sense of connection with is gone, leaving behind replacement characters who, while not bad in themselves, aren't enough to augment the plodding, predictable plot. There's no joy, no compelling story, just a depressing, foreboding tale about some people you don't particularly care about. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 1 was excellent and I was truly amazed that something so good came from M. Night Shyamalan.

If you're familiar with any of his works, you know that he (almost) always has a great idea, but that idea gets completely ruined and twisted by... him.

Every single movie, TV series he's made -- including the infamous After Earth -- starts amazingly and is really captivating at first, but gets completely ruined in the end.

Wayward Pines is unfortunately no different.

I won't go into detail about the first season here -- after all, I'm reviewing Season 2 -- but compared to the first season, this one is utterly disappointing.

All mystery is gone, everything that made Wayward Pines so great and captivating is gone.

Two leads are killed-off immediately and instead of continuing an interesting story, we get thrown in the middle of a boring war, rebellions etc. It lacks any secrecy and anything that would captivate the audience. Instead of mystery we get a dull and uninteresting war-like scenario with barely any relatable characters and some seriously bad castings.

Unfortunately, the season never recovers from its horrendous beginning.

Also, there are more child actors now (and child actors are never good) or at least in more visible roles, including Charlie Tahan (Ben), who is absolutely dreadful. Every scene with that actor is painful to watch.

To conclude, M. Night Shyamalan has once more taken a great idea -- an interesting story -- and slowly but surely turned it into something dreadful and borderline unwatchable.

2/10

If you ask me this is the opposite of Archer, Archer is funny and awesome while this show goes on to look like Beavis and Butthead got high and started telling hurmorless jokes and insipidly stupid dialogue. I honesty want to like this show but I can't, it has assembled a great cast for a pointless reason, the show has great potential and I had high expectations but this just blows, the show dosnt seem to have humor at all, the characters are annoying, the dialogue sounds like mindless blabbering, and the show is just boring and not what I would expect from an adult comedy, no violence or decent sexual humor it rather looks like a kids cartoon for adults. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst popular show I have ever seen. Who would watch this terrible show? This show is just very disgusting. It gets worse if she goes to school. I strongly dislike the show and I advise you to not watch it. Even Dora the Explorer is better, and that show is just bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This movie really sucked. Bad acting, cheesy production, and a heavy-handed dose of religiosity. One of the weaker attempts to adapt King's work to the silver (or phosphor) screen. There have been worse (e.g. Children of the Corn and its sequels) but also many far better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was so looking forward to this mini-series but cannot believe how bad it is.  I could barely get through the first 2 hours without laughing at some of the putrid acting.  The soap opera story lines are silly and contrived. The dialogue is written like the story took place in modern day. Not familiar with the book I thought this was going to be an exciting retelling of the Masada story.  Unfortunately it is not.  Too bad.  I gave it a two because Sam and Cote are very good but other than that....oy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While the description of the show sounded intriguing and perhaps refreshing the actual creative direction and execution is absolutely horrendous. Within the first 15 minutes of the pilot the audience is left (or at least I was) scratching their heads at the bizarre concept. Upon hesitation I continued to watch the pilot, but it only got worse from there ranging from the character's interactions with each other to the ridiculous idea that people are killing themselves over a TV show. Overall, the pilot doesn't even leave any suspense instead it was baffling. Finally, on top of all of this absolutely dreadful plot the acting doesn't get much better either, but what else do you expect from the CW nowadays? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Someone needs to advise TV executives that just because a movie might be successful, that success does not necessarily translate to a hit TV show. Here is a perfect example. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You can certainly identify when its trying to be funny but its just not. It has typical sitcom situations but they just don't pull the jokes off. Everything happens is pretty much how you would expect it to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Listen, we need a Game of Thrones show"
"No problem!"
"But like Once Upon A Time..."
"No problem!"
"...with some LOST quirks and questions...."
"No problem!"
"...an make it disjointed and boring...this is NBC after-all."
"No problem!" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poorly written script with incoherent confusing plots. As for the poorly written part as an example in the first episode where Dorothy finds Lucas (the Scarecrow?) being crucified with crows pecking on him... she pulls him down and her first words are "Are you all right?" I could not stop laughing... supposedly this Dorothy is a nurse in our reality, but obviously missed the class on torture and that you are likely not all right after enduring it.   And it appears no one smiles or laughs ever in OZ... not ever, not even a little bit.  Real life - even a bad life - has some lighter moments; that is reality and how people deal with their lot is not through more dreariness. The mark of a good show is too be able to portray real characters.... This series fails completely. This Dorothy needs some serious psychological treatments (or a lobotomy) and comes across as a big time loser... certainly no one to sympathize with... and the Wizard of OZ in 'Emerald City'... Well, who said you had to know how to act to get into acting and get a leading role in Hollywood? `Nuf said, the series is a complete waste.

Oh, Man....Another divorcee falls for her therapist? Paula Marshall in another bad sitcom? Jay Mohr not funny? Tell me it's not true. Ms. Marshall could use better representation. That's it! I'm writing a sitcom. I can't do much worse. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst thing about Chase is that it's so much worse than it should be. The actors are good - in fact the actress playing Annie Frost is excellent.  The setting and the sets are interesting and have the potential to show new facets of the Texas landscape. But the plotting.  And the scriptwriting.  O. M. G.  Cringemakingly awful.  I can summarize every episode as follows:  1. There is a bad serial killer who commits coldblooded murder while we watch. 2. Four or five Marshals are at their HQ and hear about the murder.  They go gallivanting off after the bad guy. 3. The bad guy coldbloodedly murders several more people as we watch.  4. The Marshals ineptly manage to not stop the bad guy from murdering a bunch of people.5. Despite their ineptitude, the Marshals apparently have limitless government funding - they have private jets and helicopters to whisk them at light speed from Texas to Las Vegas or Boston at the drop of a hat. .6. One of the Marshals, usually Annie, has a ridiculously unlikely psychological insight into the bad guy after each dead body. These stupid ideas give the Marshals Important  Clues so they know where the bad guy will go next.  Unfortunately, the Marshals will never get there in time to prevent another coldblooded murder. 7. There will be a macabre cellphone fail. 8. When the hour is almost up there will be a final chase and the Marshals - or, really, Annie- will catch the bad guy.  The question in the mind of the audience is why on earth the Marshals will not be fired or demoted for their ineptitude. I mean why can't 5 trained, fit law enforcement officers bristling with weapons, & spending money like water prevent a bad guy on the lam from murdering half a dozen people in a day?  The sad thing is that with some decent plotting and imaginative writing Chase has the potential to be interesting.  But the insultingly predictable plots and jawdroppingly inane dialog will kill this show dead in a very short time.

Watched the pilot last night (August 23). The production values are good, the acting is good, everything is good, but the story goes nowhere. The pilot begins about five different story threads of mysterious things happening to people, but whatever is happening remains unknown. So people are killed, people are kidnapped, etc. etc. but no clue as to who or what or why this is happening.

So long as the nefarious force or villain(s) or whatever it's going to be shows up, then the viewer is left in limbo feeling very unsatisfied. If you don't tell the viewer what's going on, the viewer doesn't know who to root for and so a large part of the viewer satisfaction equation is missing. This is an essential part of story telling. When it's ignored, the result can be unsatisfactory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I read this was based on the movie Legion I had hope that this would be semi-decent.
My hopes were dashed terribly by the inept storytelling, bad acting, uselessly ugly effects and powerfully silly Anthony Head with an American Accent.

I'm not in the mood to go into how bad this series is, it's just too bad for me to even try and explain. This is a sign that the Syfy channel needs to fold and die, because it's doing nothing good anymore.

The Worst Show Of 2008!Crappy Cast, Acting, And Scripts..This Is Not The Same As The Old Days On 90's 90210...The Only Good Thing About This 90210 Is Brenda Is Back..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watched sadly 5 episodes for Shena Grimes (Probably spelled wrong but whatever I like her), anyways dont know why Im a guy but I decided to watch this and the original. Normally originals are farless entertaining, good, or real but in this case thats what was different once claimed Beverly Hills turned into the crap fest 90210. This is such a shame that Gossip Girls and 90210 seem to be able to survive. One Tree Hill is more some what realist then 90210. If you want my opinion America doesnt seem how to make a REGULAR teen drama they only know how to make fake (90210), rich (Gossipe Girl), dramatic (Pretty Little Liars), supernatural (Vampire Diaries) shows. America seems to think that a show can't survive without some kind of gimik or angle. Until in 2009 I found Degrassi and said finally then I found out it was a Canadian show.   Really if Canada can make a far more better and realist teen drama and last for more then what 30 years America should be ashamed. If you want something real watch Degrassi want something fake watch 9020. It only gets a 2 because Shenna Grimes 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry, but this is not funny. I gave it four episodes and just never got into it. The acting is bad and the vulgarity is over the top just to be vulgar not to be funny. I may watch just because it is on before Entourage, which is great 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good idea, bad execution. The second worse HBO show, K-Street was their worst. I love Jim Norton, but I hated this show and hated seeing him in such a substandard program. Louie should be mouth raped by a Dominican then have his face smashed in from a cinder block for putting Jimmy Norton in such an awful light. Ramone, please get me a sitcom that doesn't blow. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hawthorne has potential. I looked forward to watching the series partially because it is the first nighttime drama series that features a non-white lead. So kudos to the network for showing this type of progressive thinking. I am not sure Jada knows where her strength lay. I believe she needs to take a gut check . Like the character,Hawthorne, Jada seems to be searching for an identity. She appears to have the potential, skill and acting ability but I do not feel her...she just does not come. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The medical & nursing errors I'm the show makes me wonder if they have a licensed person advising them or not. ( IVs going wrong direction on a scalp vein on a baby, insulin given IM rather than SQ, and more). The show also is demeaning to professional nurses. And the role of a chief nursing officer is nothing like the one in the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show needs to decide if it is going to be a dramatic or comedic entity. The medical advisors to the show obviously have no idea what nurses today are responsible for, and much of the sterotyping is quite insulting to the profession. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadful but tolerable. The supporting actors are all refreshing and I hope to see them in other, more worthy shows in the future, but Pinkett-Smith is a huge disappointment. She seems to have only one or two facial expressions (except when she's overacting and screaming, as in the ads) It seems there isn't much in the way of story line, just Jada trying to be cute or sexy with an attitude. Give me ER, Grey's Anatomy, or even General Hospital. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jada has potential, not sure if she know where here strength lie. I believe she needs a gut check on her strength. Hawthorne is a show that is lie her, searching for an identity. Skill misdirected 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

ok my review score was wrong - forgot to move the meter - sorry  really not liking this show as much as I did the first 2 seasons - it is no longer about the goings on at the hospital - time to get back to the core story and give the rest of the cast decent air time - JMO

If you want to see a poorly done "reimagining" of Duck Dynasty then look no further. Personally a fan of Mark and what he has done but this show is just awful and obviously scripted reality tv. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've read about this show in TV Guide and was quite surprised that it was canceled after only one episode. Heather Graham did her best, but her tv show didn't do its best either, which is probably why the show was canceled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wasn't Heather Graham's best tv role was on Scrubs?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted this show to work. I thought the bar setting had potential.  But I bailed on it. The first episode where they should at least try to be funny was all about how wonderful thjs legacy bar was.  The old dad just offered a grin to everything instead of being a diverse and crusty barkeep.  But the heart of the problem is the comic center of the show, Byrne, well he can't act. His last dialog with his girlfriend who was leaving him was so awkward and poorly performed that I could not imaging watching this guy every week.  This could have been a lot better. But it wasnt. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sullivan and Son is a tired dinosaur (odd when considering this is a new show) whose plots are patched together from the most generic ideas and contrived ethnic jokes out there,things that may have been funny twenty years ago but now are just stale. Watching a few episodes of this show it felt like the writers were plumbing the archives of other sitcoms and liberated their rejected episode ideas to come up with the first season of this show. Not sure what executive at TBS thought this show would be a good idea, but clearly they're wrong. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

His jokes are all the same, take a current event compare it or relate it to a item that was recently in the news. But even though he's talentless he's fair to his guests. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too much degradation of women. Is Jay trying to pull in a male audience between 13-Stupid years old? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Equal doses of bland, trite, and irritating. I'm not sure why exactly Jay is back (not that he ever left) with the same tired, faux-inoffensive comedy that he's always dished out. Move on Jay, please move on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Jay but this reworked show is simply awful. He doesn't stand a chance. The King of Late Night TV has been reduced to a 2nd stringer at a time and place where the show does not belong. I feel sorry for Jay.

The idea of a transplant medical show is a good one - note how ER and Grey's Anatomy have used transplant themes in their shows all along. First, get it straight on how a REAL transplant center works - First, I am a transplant coordinator and I am not late for a meeting because a physician told me to run out and get the donuts that he likes. I am a highly educated nurse specializing in transplantation and I have never encountered a physician that would ever be that disrespectful to me or anyone else on the team! Second, the recipient team would NEVER come into contact with the donor family at the donor site let alone exchange iinformation about the possible recipient - that is violating HIPPA laws. There is so much more to the inner workings of a transplant center than what this show portrays. If anything, it may be more of a detriment to organ donation! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad acting and bad story line, not believable at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unbelievably bad. It certainly looks like it was expensive to make, so it does look gorgeous, but other than that, there isn't a single positive thing to say about it. The acting is so wooden, even the actor playing Marco Polo fails to be convincing as someone anyone would follow. Although it's hard to tell how much the actors are at fault here. Between the clearly poor direction of scenes and the incredibly corny dialogue, they don't have much to work on. It didn't even have a "so bad it's good" quality, and I had to stop watching after episode 4.

If anything, the critics were overly kind to this slop. Based on how many of these ridiculously positive user reviews start with "I made an account just to tell you the critics are wrong", I wouldn't be surprised if they were fake accounts made by the production company. Either that, or it's yet more evidence that the quality of television can be complete garbage but spend enough on special effects and the brainless masses won't care. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

it wasn't bad but then they had to kill the black guy first, the scenario isn't believable at all, the characters are stupid. Until they make believable and smart characters i'll change my opinion 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really poor writing, absolutely terrible in fact. It's nothing like The Walking Dead of course, but it's trying to latch on to its popularity. It's watchable if you want basic entertainment and special effects, if you want drama, steer well clear. The 'joke' character isn't funny, simply annoying, and completely out of place. The main characters are two dimensional cliches. It has guns, zombies and explosions - if that's what you want, you might like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is like The Walking Dead crossed with World War Z. Better than nothing, worse than anything I've been following. BTW being so stupid about that baby zombie questions how the soldier survived for three years, besides the scenes being just absurd. And the black guy was one of the firsts to die. I mean come on! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As this show drew comparisons to Sex and the City, I grew skeptical that it could possibly live up to that kind of hype. As I sat and watched the first couple episodes, I kept thinking the same thing: WHO writes this crap?? This show sucks! It's not subtle, clever, or original. Take Sex and the City, which was relevant 10 years ago, mind you, water it down and take all the depth out of the characters, and hit the audience over the head with trite, so-called "edgy" concepts. I swear every other line is "a woman can do anything a man can do." If you have to say it so much, it kind of loses its meaning. I mean really, haven't we progressed past this? Complete crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, it is embarrassing to see these talented actresses act and speak in scenes that are so clunky and stilted. The dialogue is atrocious, and the directing weak. After a few moments of watching, it started to pain me to see these women, whose work I had previously admired, say such idiotic things in these lame, contrived situations. Seriously, the writers of this show need to be replaced... Or, maybe they could only find non-guild writers for their show? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very disappointed with this polite...The B word is thrown around too, too much on sitcoms, Unnecessary-I was hoping for a Seinfeld show, clean, funny, with unpredictable humor...with out the constant bi+&*ch humor what a waste of 30 min. I rate this show Awful...I didn't laugh once. I was really waiting for the punch line and it never came. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this show because of the great actors in it.
The writing is so bad that the acting looks bad.

I think the whole adoption re union part of this show is in poor taste, as many people in America these days are reuniting with their birth families and from what I  hear,  it really isn't all that funny a situation and to think a 27 year old man would move in with his birth mother sounds rather ridiculous and very far fetched.

And the way they have written this, making Kirstie a ditsy  dame.... if you could call it that, kind of makes birth mothers out there look bad too.    Just a bad idea in general, and not funny at all.

Gave it two tries  and the second one was worse than the first one.  I don't think I even laughed once, come to think of it.   There are much funnier shows out there  to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You know those "real crime" shows that cram 30 minutes of program into 120 minutes.  Secrets and Lies seems to trying to cram 30 minutes into an entire season.  I've watched three episodes now, trying to be fair, but I am just totally tired of watching Ryan Phillippe "acting", with extreme anger, upon every little impulse that enters his mind. I don't know where this story is going but I have come to simply not care.  It drags on and on with everyone acting like jerks.  Only the automaton police detective remains consistent in her behavior.  I don't know why Ryan hasn't taken a punch at her tiny little face yet but I figure that as the show stretches on and on that punch is probably lurking in the near future.  I will miss it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a movie that's supposed to picture a genius people, this movie has a dumb writer and it's meant to be enjoyed by 'low-IQ' people. There are so many facts that are wrong in this movie, while it's about someone who excels at science and tech, made it unbearable to watch for me; even though the plot might be enjoyable. I can't stand a writer that made a script where it says they couldn't get pass someone's firewall, but had his physical laptop already. Or invent something called 'router-hub' as their plot device. Why wouldn't they just stick with the real thing, it's not more complicated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Without a doubt, Scorpion is one of the most poorly written programs being aired. The dialogue is forced, unnecessary and, in general, poorly delivered; reminiscent of the '50s TV westerns. The predicaments are contrived, bizarre and beyond  improbable; the solutions even more so. The characters (or should I say caricatures) are cartoonish and not at all credible. And what genius would cast swarthy-skinned of obviously mediterranean descent Elyes Cherif Gabel to play the blue-eyed son of two Irish potatoes named O'Brien? If it were aired on Saturday morning opposite Power Rangers, it might find a suitable audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dumb show about smart people.  Jadyn Wong's speech is a constant battle between her over-enunciation and flat delivery. It is distracting, annoying and just draws more attention to her inability to act.
Eddie Kaye Thomas and Elyes Gabel are not believable even as Applestore geniuses but can at least make there way through the scenes.
Ari Stidham is the best thing on this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Scorpion represents a lame but earnest attempt by CBS to create an action drama pandering to what CBS executives assume younger viewers want to see: frenetic paced action, preposterous stories and lots of references to high tech.  The end result is dizzying and awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was disappointed in the pilot for this show.  It started with an interesting premise (4 misfit geniuses doing a combined McGyver / A-Team / Mentalist / 24 kind of hybrid), with hopefully some cool effects and maybe even some decent character development.  What the pilot turned into was, unfortunately, a mish-mash of rapid-fire techno babble overlaid onto a series of the worst misrepresentations of aviation that I've ever seen on screen.

I'll just mention a couple of the glaringly stupid things in the pilot.  First, commercial aircraft aren't really "controlled" by the ATC system in a technical sense.  The controllers and equipment that are part of ATC give instructions to the pilots, based on airspace category and workload, who then execute them if they are able.  The aircraft pilots in command are the final authority on aircraft operation and safety.  They will not simply orbit helplessly because they can't raise approach/departure control at LAX.

If the ATC system for LAX and satellite facilities does go down (which is almost impossible anyway), the pilots of the 56 aircraft in the vicinity will simply go somewhere else.  In Southern California there are a plethora of large airports within 30 minutes flight time from LAX.  San Diego, Ontario, San Bernadino, Burbank, not to mention Mojave, Palmdale, Edwards.  Pilots will simply divert to an alternate airfield.

Just because the ATC system for LAX goes down doesn't mean that all of the aircraft in the vicinity will suddenly lose communications.  Most aircraft communications are actually by VHF/UHF radio, with pre-established frequencies for every aviation entity involved in their flight.  So if you can't get ahold of LAX approach control, you can simply call up San Diego control.  You can call up the dispatcher for your airline, you can communicate with other aircraft on the LAX tower frequencies, or in a pinch, use the guard frequency (121.5 Mhz).  In other words, the word will get out very quickly that LAX is closed and they should find an alternate.

There are even procedures in the event that all radio comms are lost.  In every control tower is a hand-held light gun, which the controllers can use to give basic landing clearance to aircraft.  The show depicted a clear day, all the pilots need for a VFR landing is a clear runway and a green signal from the tower light gun.

Finally, there are no F-22's on alert near LAX to intercept wayward commercial aircraft.  Even assuming those aircraft were available, their first priority in an intercept would be to establish communication, not shoot down civil airliners.  Again, the very first thing the pilots of those fighters would do would be to communicate with the airliners on the guard frequency (121.5 Mhz), and if that didn't work, approach/departure and tower frequencies for LAX.  Absent that, hand gestures to "land now" or "follow me" can also be used.

Oh, and air traffic control software is not installed on aircraft, nothing on a commercial airliner is ethernet/laptop compatible, and the turbulence of an airliner in ground effect would blow that Ferrari off the runway.

The executives who made and promoted this show should be embarrassed that they didn't shell out a few extra bucks for an actual aviation consultant who could have told them how ridiculous the premise was.  They have already lost me as a viewer.

-Irritated in Denver 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked most of the actors though, honestly, there was nothing special about any of them.  Robert Patrick did do an excellent job of playing "Robert Patrick".

But the writing!  What a dismally stupid plot line.  All of the passenger planes in southern California will crash or be shot down because of communications problems.  Notes to pilots:  Look out the window.  Avoid other planes.  Land your damn plane wherever you can find an airport big enough. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Updated: the second episode is now out, and maybe worse than the pilot. 'Single Point of Failure' is an apt term for this show, since the writers are the single point of failure. It continues to amaze me that people (the average viewer) will accept fantasies like a person walking up to a random laptop and within seconds of furiously typing on the keyboard, terminal windows come up as the person is magically writing code (all of which is nonsensical, if you watch the method names) which streams up the page and the genius quickly concludes that the virus is unique to this one laptop. I mean, MAYBE 3-4 seconds later. Seriously? CBS, you need to either jettison this show (which would be a shame) or jettison the writers. I vote to eject the writers. I'm dropping this from a 3 to a 2. When it gets to 1, I just quit.

Originally: Sorry, I really wanted to like this, but it's so poorly written! The writers try to use big words and phrases and hope no one notices, and hope that we all just go along for the ride. However, anyone slightly tech-savvy will groan every time they hear something silly like "after I update the antenna driver to boost the signal" or "the backup will be overwritten in three minutes" or make assumptions like "restarting the server will be immediate."

What's shocking is that this is the same network that produces Big Bang Theory, and who employs a talented and smart panel of writers who are VERY tech-savvy. Everything is checked with a physicist to make sure it's correct, the writers all call each other out over ridiculous ideas, and they ground their tech in reality, and THAT is what makes the show funny and believable: it's authentic, even for the super geniuses.

Scorpion's writers don't seem to have the same funding. Their solutions are just ridiculous, and anyone with HALF their IQ will recognize it. Unfortunately, that aspect totally detracts from the show and story line, making it nearly impossible to watch the show without chuckling sadly about how stupid and unbelievable it is. I mean, if you consult with any FAA expert, you'd find that there are dozens of backups for how to get planes down with zero communications. The assumption that you'd need an expert computer hacker within 57 minutes to reboot the entire system, or 57 planes come crashing down, is just 57 ways of ludicrous.

The actors themselves seem to do a great job and are likable (although the Asian girl is really hard to understand, like she's got paper in her mouth or something...), the general story concept is great, and KMP is a great cast for the show (as is her son), but it's just too implausible to make it stick.

I will give it two more episodes, but at this point, I don't hold out much hope. Throw out your lazy writers and get talented new ones, with experts in the field, and then you will have a smart show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show could be so good. The concept is great, the execution is horrible. I wouldn't exactly call Big Bang's focus on Sheldon's social problems subtle, but this show makes it seem that way. They don't show you the character's quirks, they drill them into your head via repetitive, sappy, unnecessary dialogue. We get it, they're smart but socially inept. Heard that story line plenty. Have the actors show us their quirks, their struggles, don't blatantly state it every 5 minutes. That is, unless the actors lack the depth to subtly show us their issues rather than relying on spelling it out multiple times an episode.

Then there's the issue of the unnecessary action scenes (about what you would expect with a Fast and Furious alum directing). Can't communicate with the pilot of a plane? Call someone on board who is likely to have their phone on, have them give the phone to the pilot, and instruct him to land via phone right? WRONG. They have him fly 8 feet above the ground (again, if he can get within 8 feet, why not land?) while they drive 200 MPH underneath, with a waitress hanging out the top, while the co-pilot climbs down onto the landing gear to hand them an ethernet cable. All so that they can reconnect the radio and instruct him to land. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The problems with shows like this is that the characters are usually smarter than the writers.  Turn off grid power to defeat a cipher lock?  Wow Einstein himself (who apparently would not be smart enough to make the cut on this team) would be amazed. CBS tends to wait longer before canceling shows but if this one lasts a month it will be a terrible waste of advertiser dollars. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. Tonight's episode; so stupid I feel dumb trying to explain things it gets wrong in first ten minutes.  These geniuses need way smarter writers.  Cast has some talent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like the show but feel it is going in the wrong direction with the waitress.  Just write her out. She doesn't help the team and the story of a love interest between her and Walter would definitely be cheesy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I try not to watch this show because I turned it on and counted over 50 times that they said "sex" "abstinence"  or made some other blatant sexual reference in one episode "Ashley, are you going to have sex?" "I'm not going to have sex.  And if i was going to have sex i wouldn't tell you about sex" "Sex is something you should talk about.  sex...." blah blah blah.  Oh please,  realistic this show isn't 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In the end, all you see is kids mention the word sex 300 times during one episode. It's a completely biased show with bad Christian undertones hidden by it's onimous, self-absorbed, completely mornic, sex depraved writers. It's really hard to not look away from this mess, and I mean that in the worst way possible. There are plenty of shows trying to captilize in on the Juno/teen-mom situation. Ironically, MTV's Teen Mom is just behind this, however, Teen Mom is atleast a docu-drama. While, the writers of this show try and make the kids sound mature, all they sound like is droids from planet mono-tone. However, it ends up being one of those "so bad, it's hard not to watch" shows. Which was probably the goal for this piece of crap all along. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is absolutely awful. The acting is bad, the story is bad, and this is not what a teenagers life is like. In some episodes they say the word sex so many times it's unbearable. The drama element is awful and this show, overall, is just a big pile of crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a teenager, this show insults me. It is probably the most unrealistic show I have ever seen. Teens talk about sex. Teens have sex. But its not all we talk about. I absolutely cringe everytime some character opnes their mouth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unrealistic, but still somewhat entertaining. I am an adult and I have a child and to me the most bothersome thing about this show is how mature all the teenagers seem. I've seen adults less mature about sexual issues, yet every 15 year old seems to have a better handle on sex than I do. Obviously written by someone who has a very idealistic view of what teenagers really feel like. Most teenage sex, especially at 15, is not fueled by logical thinking but passion, curiousity, and peer pressure. Writers do not have their finger on the pulse of teenagers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I started watching this show with the Pilot and found it mildly enjoyable, but wow has it gone downhill. The main thing that bothers me is that every single scene is about sex- who 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not worth wasting your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Typical fundie-Xtian influenced didacticism on worn out topics that are not borne out but substantiated facts. teen pregnancy is on the decline but this show merely ramps up the hysteria and bludgeons the audience with inane chicanery and ideological claptrap. We stopped watching it after we realized it gives our daughter the narrow, myopic Xtian cult messages about life. No more Xtian fundies in TV please, and enough of the "god network" already. If this is the mainstream of America, there's real reason to be afraid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fifteen-year-old girl in your average high school, I can honestly say that I'm appalled by the way this show portrays people my age. If the poor, unbelievable acting performances weren't bad enough, the stereotypical characters are so unrealistic that I found myself embarrassed to be watching the show at all. I'll try not to reiterate what many other people have already spoken of, but it's hard not to ramble on about how insulting I find this show when the adult's impression teenage life is so condescending and unrealistic. If that wasn't bad enough, the parents are annoying and would actually improve themselves by reading cheesy parenting books (and if that was done on purpose, I couldn't tell). All in all, this is one of the worst shows on TV. At least shows like Gossip Girl, though unrealistic, ACKNOWLEDGE that they're unrealistic. This show pretends to be what high school is actually like, and I'm disgusted by it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor acting, weak plot 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've checked out the first two shows, and each time I couldn't get past the first main commercial break without turning it off or switching channels. Seems I'm reminded a lot of Northern Exposure, in a been-there-done-that sort of way. The Ann Heche character still couldn't get herself a pair of boots by the second episode? This show sinks in its own mud of bad acting and sophomoric writing, despite the nice (yawn) scenery and cute raccoon that got old real fast. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are few experiences more mind-numbingly dull than watching a disaster movie. The focus on the disaster itself rarely leaves any scope for the development of anything which is of real, human, interest, and despite whatever moralistic overtones are attached to them, function as cathartic destruction fantasies for their neurotic audiences. As such, the narrative material is usually pretty thin, so imagine stretching that out across a whole television series and it soon becomes apparent that Jericho is not tapping an especially rich vein capable of sustaining a serialized production. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised therefore, that they resorted to setting up a Lost-esque ensemble of 'mysterious' characters and multiple unknowns pertaining to the situational setting -- read: gimmicks. But, and this is a testament to the power of hype, I was both surprised and dismayed by the magnitude of the catastrophe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

poor writing and and a contreived plot 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like many other people, I was lured into this show with great expectations. The idea of a nuclear attack on the U.S should have been great! Instead, they ruined it with boring and predictable love triangles, marital problems, teenage dramas and entire episodes consumed by things that have nothing to do with the nuclear attack.So, essentially, you walk into the show expecting some sort of Homefront inspired event that sees the characters struggling to survive an invasion. Unfortunately, what you actually get is the OC styled drama and characters who you can't even care enough to remember their names. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm finished I gave it a good shot but how could they kill off Beth Grant? The only watchable character of the series. Boring! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very disappointed. I was really hooked with all of the hype created prior to the premier. I will give the show one more week to strike enough interest to make me come back. if not... Then I guess it's back to WCW (kidding, of course). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Real crap. Fantasy fulfillment for some seriously inadequate former public defender. But apparently renewed for another season by TNT. Incredible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yuck, what a disappointment. Two of my favorite actresses (Jane Kaczmarek and Gloria Reuben) just wasted. Plot line was pretty far fetched. And it was boring to boot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't think Jimmy is quite ready for his own tv show, its awkward to watch, he seems kinda lost in what to ask his guest. It doesn't seem to be getting better. The only word that keeps coming to mind is awkward. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Jimmy seems like a nice guy, but the writing isn't giving him anything. Thd band doesn't connect at all and they look and act like they just got out of prison. Compare it to Kevin Eubanks and the Tonight Show band where Kevin warms up, smiles and jokes with the host. I really hope he succeeds, but there's nothing there right now and I can't see it lasting as is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There isn't enough room on late night TV for two Jimmy's. Guess which one has got to go. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a terrible choice for a band. There's little banter between Jimmy and his band. There also seems to be very little chemistry, unlike that which existed between Conan and the Max Weinberg Seven, particulary with Max himself, and La Bamba. This even makes Paul Schaeffer look funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really try to laugh.I really try. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I understand that its tough to host a talk show but I feel like maybe NBC jumped the gun by putting him on this show, Jimmy Fallon has always been a nervous guy but, following Conan O' Brien who was never nervous in front of crowds and could easily make fun of himself if nessescary to keep the audience laughing, Jimmy just doesnt seem to work well as a host, I've seen him ruin a number of Punch-lines by stuttering and Trying too hard. And is it just me but does it seem like the studio audience keeps getting smaller and smaller because everytime I tune in it sounds like the audience got smaller than the last time I watched it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The pilot is a tragic wreck of some housewives serial against weeds and breaking bad, with no survivors, only pale and feeble zombies. Best of the show: that Anson Mount from Hells on Wheels. He dies, but after playing the part with dignity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I felt the show was not much of an comedy.  The real vet. Dr. Po on the cable channels has funnier moments.  Unless they come up with some better story lines, this show will be a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had to turn it off after 5 minutes as I could no longer bear the extremely humourless antics going on. Too bad; I was looking forward to a comedy about an animal practice. It could have been fun. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Strange and terribe acting, and is saved by Gabrielle Union, the one actress on the show with talent, Stuart Townsend acting grade: 7 ** C+ Gabrielle Union acting grade: 9 *** A- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Matt from TV Guide summed it up best: Plagued by mediocre writing and stubbornly dull acting, this unpleasant misfire feels like slow death as it spins out subplots from Disaster Movie 101.
I couldn't have written a better comment. Just terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is like watching flaming car crash, you tell yourself you should look away, but find yourself watching anyway.  None of the characters have any survival instinct, they are in a quarantined virus outbreak and are constantly taking their protective gear off to show how much they care.  One example of the actions of those inside the quarantine in tonight's episode a doctor who just realized he was infected,  turns to his co-workers and vomits blood all over them.  Yeah, way to care Doc! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was a boring show, the only ones excited were Oprah and Nate....Watched it once and that will be it for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I expected so much and got nothing. Felt bad for the contestants and the people they were trying to help. Judges didn't do much either for the show. Over all bad selection of cast. Maybe it would of done better if they choosen smarter and didn't look like they were using these people just for entertaining. Very disappointed! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, I never thought I would care about characters as little as do for the people on this show. The characters, multi-camera set up/laugh track do not belong on NBC's Thursday. Put this garbage on CBS where it belongs! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's truly upsetting with "Whitney" is that Whitney Cummings is a great comedic writer. However, someone had the brilliant idea to put her in front of a camera in a clunky sitcom with an uncomfortable "live audience" awkwardly laughing too loud at jokes that clearly seem forced and dry. Whitney Cummings is great when roasting, great as a stand-up comedienne, great as a writer, but terrible as a comedic actress. The best punchlines, bumpers, and laugh-tracks in the world couldn't save this sinking shipwreck. Sorry, Whitney, but "Whitney" is doomed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like Whitney as a comedian, but this show SUCKS. Seriously. Take this off and give the timeslot to Parks and Recreation, which is the best show on television. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Whitney (the comic) is brilliant, as is co-star Chris D'elia. Whitney (the sitcom) has issues. Unfortunately, when the show debuted, to the horror of female viewers the nation over, the Lucille Ball style comedy, pitting a feeble, weak, emotional train-wreck of a fifties-style housewife against the smart, sassy, modern-day everyman who, somehow (to the shock of all who know them) manages to put up with all the crazy, day in and day out, came across as offensive, to say the least... the very least. As time wore on, the grandness of  Whitney Cummings' charm and personal wit combined with the spirit of joy and the pursuit of fun, embodied in her male lead, to offer the audience a true treat:  the unmarried marrieds and their world of random youth-centered humor, on a terribly limited basis. You see, rather than fix what had gone so awry in the early stages of development, the producers and network executives fresh off of too many failures to mention took it upon themselves to attempt yet another shift toward the ever-threatening Friends-clone. When faced with the need to introduce more of the comedic tales and riffs so pronounced and laugh-inducing in the live stage shows of Cummings and D'elia, the decision was made to ignore reason and make greater use of a sour extended cast. Why make a show about a couple, with some friends, sure, but also with a magnificent set of in-laws in the form of Peter Gallagher and Jane Kaczmarek and with, oh... I don't know... jobs, when you can make another crummy Friends-clone starring a bunch of terrible actors? The cast consists of the magnificent Whitney Cummings, the ever-lively Chris D'elia, a boring red-head, a soulless blonde, a dwarf of some kind who may or may not be a cardboard cutout of a dead politician and, of course, a gay Indian, 'cause who doesn't need one of those lurking awkwardly in the corner of every scene. This show is bursting with underutilized talent in the form of the Cummings/D'elia pairing but also in the form of the tragically absent, perfectly cast, parents of the title character. If I were writing this, Whitney and Alex would move to Portland or Seattle, get real jobs, make new (less present) work friends and spend a heck of a lot more time with Whitney's parents, who have followed her there. I would not continue to waste such an opportunity as the one presented by the pairing of these two comedians by taking valuable screen-time away from the main characters, the main couple, in a misguided effort to recapture the glory of a long-dead sitcom, the stars of which were uniformly as talented as both Cummings and D'elia and none of whom, ever, even on their worst days, presented a performance as dull, lifeless or audience killing as the nameless, faceless, too-boring to recall, oddly present yet completely forgettable side characters from this sitcom, all of whom serve no purposes beyond giving the writers an excuse for their uninspired writing and allowing Whitney and Chris extra time in their trailers to perfect their new stage acts. I do not advise watching this unless, of course, you are studying the main actors in an effort to better your own comic timing, stage act, screenplay, book, or just make yourself a little more fun to be around. If you are looking for a romantic themed sitcom, buy Mad About You or The Nanny and pray for the day Cummings and D'elia find themselves freed from the shackles of the dead weight that is, fully, two-thirds of their main cast. As a last comment, I did so want to love this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

you will laugh uncontrollably at every joke. not because what you just heard was funny, but for a different reason you can't put your finger on. this show is the definition of "it's so bad it's good. and it's not like they tried to make it that way. they actually thought what they were writing was funny. that is what makes it so genuinely hilariously bad. it may not be a funny show in the way they intended but you will laugh witch is all that matters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not sure which is worse , seeing Cummings "try" to act or the overused sex jokes. The show is not fresh or new or ground breaking or even interesting,  the characters are very unlikely people with very unlikely behaviors  and in often very unrealistic scenarios. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have only seen the first episode but I have to say that it was utterly rubbish. The level of humour is so low that one of the characters (a female environmentalist) has a daughter named "Puddle". And that's meant to be funny. Avoid this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An utter disappointment within the first five minutes. I forced myself to watch the forced jokes and low humor. I expected so much more from the creators of Arrested Development. There's really no need to give a summary. A better name would be "Running Mild." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't really care whether this show is for kids or not, but after watching 5 minutes of this, I wanted to turn off the TV. They can't call this humor when the jokes are stale and just not funny. I know it's been said a lot, but the characters are boring. But the biggest problem I had with this was the awful animation. I'm not in expert in animation or stop-motion, but I could tell it was just awful after watching commercials or the pilot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this show is horrible! it shouldn't be on nikelodeon, especially not at this time slot. it comes on at 8, when my daughter usually goes to bed, but is adevertised throughout the day. jokes about banging the babysitter, handjobs, and watching porn are inappropriate on a channel that is geared towards kids!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unlike most of the reviewers here, I must be the only one to have actually watched other sci-fi shows.  The acting on Stargate was embarrassing, the writing mediocre to poor, and the stories repetitive and simpleminded.  Not to mention the silly costumes and "special" effects.  Anyone who feels this is the "best" sci-fi series out there needs an injection of taste or to seriously broaden their horizons.  The humor of the show is to be laughed at, not with.  The original Battlestar Galactica from the 1970's is better than this joke of a series, but it seems only "fans" choose to comment.  Snap out of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Howlingly bad, but — and here's the kicker — not in a funny way. It's painfully unentertaining.

Historically it's remarkably wrong. Now, I usually don't care if a piece of historical fiction get things wrong, but this barely gets anything right. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, so I watched the Pilot & I'm halfway through the second episode and I'm sorry, but the characters are dull and not reacting realistically. There are too many distracting holes in human logic that would follow the human psyche & curiosity if placed in this scenario, like insisting on leaving a dead-end road when there are buildings they haven't even gone into to look for clues, help or answers. Why are they overplaying the discord so soon when there's no reason to feel fully trapped yet? When they see the van, why didn't they get in it and drive around? Why build a fire in the hallway to set off the smoke alarm and not just break a light bulb and place a piece of paper on the element? When the elevator button yielded no results, why didn't someone try to open the elevator doors to see if there's a way up? Why break a chair in order to fashion a key, yet not throw the chair through the window? Why not interview each other to find (as one reviewer already said) find a common thread? When encountering the "force field", why would a supposedly trained military man who claims to know about confrontation and caution, use his own human body to sacrifice knowing where the "force field's" parameters are and not an inanimate object, like a chair? If they were suspicious of the food (and they should be, considering), why eat the Chinese food without asking the cooks to eat it first? They seemed cooperative enough to me. Why not ask them how they get the food delivered? And again, why not ask them about the van? If they're so concerned about "Big Brother" and the camera, why are they not getting up there and knocking the cameras down in hopes of a response? Why go all caveman and decide to start a fire to set off alarms and see so clearly that the cameras are a potential Achilles heel for whomever is holding them? Finally, if they keep insisting on running through a "force-field", why not go searching for a power source?I'm sorry, but the roles these characters are playing are already a bit obvious in their cultural/social "placement", which I might add, seems to be poorly cast already. But beyond that, it's terribly distracting that these people are not reacting realistically to their environs? I can't seem to get past their ignorance, lack of curiosity, boring dialogue, attention to all the wrong things (dress shop, really?) and inattention to potential power plays against those who are holding them?Unless these people were chosen for their ignorance as some social experiment in not-so-contemporary psychology in an iconoclastic yet technological setting, this is just a sorry excuse for writing, acting and logic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This series, based on the DC comics property and adapted for TV by the creator of "Californication," seeks to be edgy. Tom Ellis oozes charm in the lead role, but it's not edgy enough because it's on a network, but also not interesting enough to hold your attention. To do this well, you probably need to be a little more unbounded (or on cable), as it is this feels like a slickly made but hollow series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tame. And boring. It's just another person-with-amazing-perception-teams-up-with-cop-to-solve-crime-of-the-week show. The backstory is hardly played and never extrapolated with wit and creativity. The writers seem mostly obsessed with sex, making for nothing but quotidian mundanity. If you've read the graphic novels by Mike Carey on which the character is allegedly based, you are in for unutterable levels of disappointment at sheer moronic mundanity of this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sucks. The Van Horn actor wasn't even fit to be in the same room with Jack N. ABC should have cast Christian Slater in that role -- once -- just to kick off the show. Writing was horrible. No wonder we don't watch Desperate Housewives. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It turned an edgy funny and disturbing movie into a soap opera. John Stamos continues to get his revenge as Rebecca Romijn continues her slide back to obscurity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Other than the excellent capture of the 70's, swingtown is a ghastly show. Everything about this show reeks. The story is dull and cliched. The characters are boring, everyone of them I wish to die. I can't stand to see my Tv insulted by something like this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

could have been good if it portrayed those NOT interested in it as normal too. Instead the monogamous couple are portrayed as too emotionally needy instead of comfortable enough to resist the lifestyle. Too skewed a perspective, and unbelievably cheesy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG can more stuff be thrown at us in the pilot?  Instead of building a story slowly "Dig" is all over the place, literally.   It was just a scratch-my-head mess.  I did not even get a sense of what this is suppose to be about or who the characters are.  So much information but no idea of what the information means.  In one scene in Mexico the sound track music was Middle Eastern....what? Just one example of what a mess this is and believe me there were many. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The most self-indulgent, brainless, and disgustingly pandering show I've ever suffered through. The only reason I've given it 2 instead of 0 is because it was fun to yell at, and because Alaska is a pretty state. I watched one episode. That is too much for me, and it is too much for humanity. God help us all if this show continues to be aired. Shame on you TLC for creating this show. Shame. On. You. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tries to be too much like THIRD WATCH (and that was an awesome show!) This one is boring and not true to life at all............ I was disappointed after the first two episodes and never watched it again since! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as I enjoyed Kiefer Sutherland as Jack Bauer and each season's gripping stories, I tried very hard to get into this 24 Legacy but it failed to work for me.
I gave it a number of tries but each weeks episodes just got more and more gratuitously violent without having the same exciting content as before. I had been saving episodes on my DVR but stopped watching and flushed the last two without checking them out.
Fail..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well here we have another show that will not see the light of day past just a hand full of episodes at most. It is just plain bad in every way. I wanted to even give the second episode a chance but, just could not see my way to caring enough to even try.

To stomach my way through poor script, acting, and show in general well I just had enough and want to say just dont waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Somewhat fun to watch, but the judging is so screwy -- it doesn't even match up with their own comments -- that it kills the enjoyment. Sure it's entertainment not real competition but like American Idol you'd like to believe the best contestant will win. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

trite writing, obligatory plot devices, wooden acting, cliched characters and fight choreography that was clumsy. david goyer (and geoff johns) has produced a truly boring television show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terribly boring with no plot line growing whatsoever. Too much gore and grunts from the main character. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As just a vampire show, its okay. But its not really Blade. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've watched (well...tried to watch) a couple of episodes of this show and thinks it might me one of the worst shows on TV. How does NBC keep renewing this thing? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Charlie 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching this show in 2008 drives home the superficiality and greed that dominated the housing bubble era, where many thought our economy could be elevated based on people selling real estate to each other for ridiculous prices that have nothing to do with real income, using loans that no one thought they'd ever have to really pay down. Real Estate agents are just as greedy. One episode showed a deal being made where the commission was over $200k to one person for a ridiculously tiny amount of work. So yes, this show has a smidgeon of value, but not for the reasons the producers thought it would. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only way it could be worse is if they played a monotone noise for thirty minutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree, this shouldn't continue. But then again I like shows like Defying Gravity and that's already off the air. One thing that really bothers me about "Accidently..." is: If the show takes place in S.F. then why do they use the outside of a building in NYC whenever they show her at work? Don't they think that New Yorks 8 million people would question this? It's a very well known building at the corner of Broadway and Houston. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never seen the quality of a series deteriorate so quickly from episode one to episode two.

I am amazed at the magnitude of the wrong turn that the writers have taken with this show.  There was so much possibility, so many paths that could have been taken.

But the path chosen was among the worst.

I ponder what CBS will use to fill this time slot in February?  *More* reruns of TBBT?   Is CBS determined to run that series into the ground?

Time will tell. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

is the season for bad sitcoms. Seriously, first the dreadful Goldbergs, now we have the Millers. Picture something loosely along the lines of "Everybody Loves Raymond", but without the comedy. The script is just awful. If you're dealing with a dysfunctional family (like most sitcoms), the humor should be wrapped around a believable plot, and not something that would not possibly happen in the real world. Most of the comedy is drawn out, using the same idea and drilling it into your skull. Well, when all goes bad, you can always rely on a fart joke, oh yes, there's that. Another talented cast wasted on lousy writing. Well, one thing this show has going for it....The GoldBergs, which makes The Millers look good 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a 2 for Jackie's outfits.  The acting is bad.  The script is bad.  We already know the plot and outcomes so there are no surprises.  I can see why the History Channel ran from it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching it is painful. It hurts my head. What the hell was the zombie green corpse that John brought out into the yard in that one episode? After that, the show lost it for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have watched this show all 5 episodes, mainly out of the inertia of plopping my old butt on the sofa at 9PM on Sundays to watch HBO- sort of rigor mortis from Sopranos days..... J from C has the worst dialogue i've ever seen in a show- did Bruce Greenwood quit already? how do you take the lead guy in a brand new series and shelve him for 2 or 3 episodes? and leave the lead to Rebecca D- who walks around looking dazed and confused with her cracking voice patterns. i've tried to like it, because the california beach town/ surfer theme is interesting, but this is really, really poorly executed. there are some HBO types who believed their own BS/ infallibility who will be looking for jobs soon 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is farb from a replacement for Six Feet Under and Sopranos. The dialogue is strange and the story boring so far. The acting seems sub par. In the last episode I wanted to turn it off and watch State of Mind after 10 minutes but stayed tune. The deal with Cissy running around looking for Shawn was boringand pathetic. Get a stroy soon or you will lose everyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very bizarre mess. No cohesion. While I watched Deadwood it was not my favorite despite being well done but J from C is just plain convoluted. Too many style mixes--too many disjointed subplots. Good luck trying to make sense out of it. I give up. Deadwood was better even in my book. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this but who could. The characters are hateful, cheating, cursing unlikeable people who respond to situations that are so unreal. Hey I'm floating - grab a camera. Hey I'm not dead - I still just want to smoke and surf. Hey, there's this weird dude - let's invite him to follow us everywhere. Whatever, it's not a thinking person's series as it's hateful people do stupid things. I'll be watching reruns of the Sopranos before watching more of this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

shame on david milch!!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh. What exactly was that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can not remember a show where the characters were more unlikeable and annoying than they are in this confusing mess of a show called "John From Cincinnati." After a frustrating three episodes, I am severely tempted to abandon the strain sitting through what amounts to a lot of hard to swallow wierdness and yelling. As I believe the story line has potential; however, I shall give it one more opportunity to charm and entice rather than fill me with distaste and bafflement. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No more Deadwood.....No more Rome.....For THIS load of crap?!! Somebody tell me that this is a just a very bad dream! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We got this instead of extending dead wood? Go f@#$ yourself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

very confusing - boring - and tuned out after 10 inutes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

HBO's new "edgy" drama is a wipe out. Don't go near it without lots of pain medication nearby. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is, at least based on the premiere, one of the most ridiculous, unwatchably pretentious TV shows ever produced. I give it a 2 only because it's good to see Ed O'Neill, the one member of the cast I didn't want to choke through the screen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I somehow, against my better instincts, managed to watch the first episode. The entire time I kept trying to figure out how they could take Deadwood off the air for this 'Twin Peaks' wanna-be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull. It might have lofty ambitions, but fails miserably in execution. Making it "weird" is no substitute for making it engaging. An frankly it wasn't that weird. I like weird. It was just tedious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trying to be campy doesn't work when you're trying to be campy.

The classic "bad" movies did not intend to be bad, they were produced with the intent to be someone's masterpiece.

You don't create a campy movie looking through the windshield, you notice it in the rear view mirror. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was a fan of Tomorrow people TOS. What I like was youth empowerment, expecting the unexpected, and non violence. In the original series, Tomorrow people were willing to help anybody regardless of whether they were TP or not. My favorite character was Mike. He brought energy and a fresh sense of morality IE One law for the rich and the poor against sleeping under bridges. A law the rich have no reason to break.
Of what I saw so far, The New Tomorrow people are constantly hunted by one organization that forces them to go underground. I found the plots to be predictable and the characters to be underdeveloped. The characters are supposed to be teens. By any stretch of the imagination, I cant believe Steven is in High School. My advice, fire the writers, create a Mike character, put the TP's in more diverse situation, find more of a role for Tim. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show has gone downhill since its premiere which wasn't that great to be honest.. The show lacks a great storyline i think Julie is focusing more about The originals and the vampire diaries than this show. it's like a side dish to her. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am a native Chicagoan, and I was very excited that the pair of shows was being filmed in the city.  To it's credit, the city is showcased in spectacular fashion.  But that's just about where my admiration ends.  The final shot inn my enjoyment of this show was the episode aired on 4/30--part two of the hospital bombing started on Chicago Fire.  One thing that is extremely troubling to me is the police brutality--this is not a joke in this city, sadly.  To have a show that glorifies something so troubling to the city.  Are we supposed to forget that, every time a suspect is beaten, s/he is going to 1. not get jail time and 2. sue the city for millions, and most likely win?  The violent Chicago cop is such a stereotype; it's not something that should be encouraged or glorified.  The second problem I had with the show is just a silly thing from last night's show--the villains were from a "ranch outside of Kankakee".  Well, there aren't a whole lot of ranches in these parts, guys.  Lots of corn fields, and the occasional cow, but no ranches.  Second problem I had was the reason the 'ranchers' were angry with the Chicago PD--apparently they were raided and family members were killed by the Chicago PD.  What were the CPD doing in Kankakee?!?  It's not even a suburb!  Just foolish; a little research would have shown these errors. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Your average Vampire/beauty to save from evil brother show. predictable plot with overused cliches and scenes. will entertain the simple minded looking for some vampire and attractive girl action but shallow plot and acting will doom this thing early. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lacks acting. I felt like I was watching Buffy without the Slayer...or Dawson's Creek. Can we get some creativity please? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So boring, i saw 2 episodes and was enought to sleep all nigth. The characters, one good guy, another bad guy, a girl... please... Twilight tv show version? even the performance it's too close to Twilight main character. not recommended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I seriously thought that this wuld be a good show at first when it came out. But after seeing one of it's first episodes, it demosntrated clearly the hunger of plagiarizing another vampire hit, the Twilight Series. Doesnt it seem a little odd how after this series came out (Twilight), every other TV show had something relevant? Sue, the Diaries have some good touches to it, but most touches are either copied or just not so well made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unoriginal...Cliches all around. Very surprised at Kevin Williamson. Not his best work. The acting was lame. Can't wait until Flashforward comes on next week...I think 2 episodes of this was enough for me. I will wait til True Blood comes back to get my love of vampires fix! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Captain should be condemned. It's hard to identify exactly what makes this show such a clunker. Maybe it's the general lack of energy, the forced charm, or the annoying quirkiness. I award this misfire 2 points only because JoAnna Garcia is a real charmer. Too bad she's wasted here. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh my god! How was that possibly broadcast?! Who cast the lead? How could Chris Klein do such a transparent and pathetic rip off of Barney from "How I Met Your Mother?" Could one joke work? Could one idea be slightly unpredictable? One line? Where was Matt LeBlanc?!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was one of the worst shows I have ever seen. I felt like I was watching my nephews put on a play in my living room. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull. And remarkably un-funny for something claiming to be a comedy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. Jeffrey Tambor and Al Madrigal are being completely wasted, the rest of the cast members ARE a waste. Every joke thuds with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Every character is mapped out in so much expository language that the viewer is left with nothing to figure for himself. This show isn't just not funny, it's agonizingly unwatchable. It get's a two because I like Madrigal and Tambor too much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will have to say I hate pretty much all shows that have a laughter track over the top of the show. It generally means the jokes are weak and you need to be told when to laugh! I did not laugh! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

HA! Aren't millenials so silly?! With their twitters and their buzzfeeds and their instagrams? Ha! They're so entitled, inexperienced, and sensitive! *Canned laughter* Pure comedy! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love sally Field and Tom Skerrit. It would make the show better if we saw more of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really painful to watch. 1 1/2 episodes is it for me. Courtney Cox is NOT funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is simply to painful to take seriously. A 40 year old woman starving to satisfy her sexual desires with 20 year olds, while at the same time being a mom isn't a nice plot line. I really hope this gets cancelled soon...for Courtney Cox's sake. She really does herself a disservice in this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was awful. C Cox has either gone overboard on the Botox or she has truly lost her acting ability. She reduces herself to one "funny" expression, which is a stiff, annoyed grimace to her neighbor. I think it's intended to be funny because she does it all the time. ugh. lee. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yes, because her behavior will go a long way towards teaching her teen aged son who to respectfully treat his future relationships. What a sorry excuse to pornography. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I lasted 8 minutes into it. Vular and it seemed to be trying way too hard. Won't watch it again, even though I'm a Courtney Cox fan. Find a better vehicle for this talent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show gets 2 points for having Ms. Cox in it. Other than that, it is a glimpse at the future of the death of television comedy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hated the show. Cox's x-husband is so lame, he makes me cringe. The show is so completely over the top in a way that is beyond annoying, Crude to say the least. Flashing a jr. high boy is jail material in some states. I couldn't wait to delete it (before teh end) and discontinue the season pass on the dvr. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad. Uncomfortable scenes seem to be Cougar Town's order of the day. These can be great if done with style, but unfortunately, the sort of level of crazy desperation shown by the central character seems to make the whole thing a little farcical. Farce can be great for a few minutes, but please don't make a TV series out of it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful, awful, awful!  Maybe in the minority, but this is possibly the most painful "comedy" show I have watched in a while.  It was cancelled and picked up by TBS.  But it is still terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was set up as a hockey comedy. There was neither much hockey or comedy in the pilot, and that's a problem. Not sure who this show is aimed at, but it's obviously a less discerning viewer than myself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm so glad they axed King of the Hill to make room for this "quality" entertainment. I hate "FOX Sunday" now. Yeah, they can't even call it "Animation Domination" anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Tyler Labine, but he is completely wasted in this overwrought mess of a show, where the kids are completely unlikable and the laughs fall flat. I hope they cancel it soon so Labine can move on to better projects. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To star off, this show is really really cheesy. Honestly the cheesiest/worst acted show I've seen in years. To top it off, it's about two detectives and blah blah cliche' story. I couldn't get through half the episode without turning it off. Easily one of the worst television shows ever created. period. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good lord, this show is bad!  I can't think of anything else to say.  Damn, I need 150 characters -- is this enough?  Let's just reiterate -- THIS SHOW IS REALLY BAD! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad, bad, so very bad. Horrible acting, horrible plot lines. Tried two episodes, didn't even make it through the second one. Jenny Garth's talent is wasted and Tori Spelling is just a joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Will go down in history as NBC's worst idea ever. The writing and acting are worse than sub-par and both Kathryn Hahn and Hank Azaria give performances that are disproportionate with their actual abilities. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fair to poor. Would-be clever scenes tacked together to look like a thrilling TV show, but not making much sense. Characters all over the map but not really going anywhere. Frantically dull. I didn't keep watching when it changed times. The finishing up on a website was good for a laugh, though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is it better than CSI? No. Better than Without a Trace? No. Has Fox gone insane by comparing mediocre shows like PrisonBreak and now, Vanished, to true gems like 24? Probably. The only decent show FOX has now is 24. That's it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bored after 15 minutes 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sounded boring in the ads and while watching it neither I nor my girlfriend could work up any enthusiasm over it. I hate to be impatient, but I was thoroughly uninterested and after 15 minutes moved on to watching something else. It might get good, but seems unlikely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hit man is trapped in hospital room surround by cops then he shoots his way out by destroying everything on a nurses station counter. How stupid do the writers think their audience is? And the taxi driver does not seem foreign enough to be a taxi driver in NY.
I would check the spoilers box but I have no idea what it pertains to in this context. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love, love, love this show but please get rid of Bishop. She is very cute but pulling this show down. She will never make it. I'm not comparing her to Ziva but the poor thing is boring. She will never be a Kate or ZIVA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is like they recorded Oliver Stone doing a Youtube comments section style rant and then added video clips to it later.  It just rambles alluding to conspiracies but never following up on them that would actually make it entertaining.  Very dis-jointed and jumps around all over  the place it makes your head spin.  He moves so fast that it doesn't give you enough time to reflect on how dumb it is.  I am left of center and this stuff is for far left wing conspiracy nuts.  The history of the world is so simple and black and white in Oliver Stone's view that I kinda wish it was all true.  If only it was just rich industrialists and Republicans that causes all the wars we could stop all wars pretty easily. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not so good. I made it all the way to the first 20 minutes of the pilot until she put a tape of Bring It in the VCR and I thought wow rip off a movie premise and then flaunt it. I'm not a fan of Glee but I can see the people on Glee have some talent to sing and dance, this is a less good copy of a show I don't even watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cant wait till this show is canceled, this show is terrible and probably one of the worst shows ive seen since CBS's Rob. ABC will pick up any show now a days and thats why i watch more NBC & CBS 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sometimes when you watch a show you can't help but wonder what was written on the page that made a TV executive say yes to sinking millions of dollars into something so poor. That was the way I felt watching this series, which hopefully isn't long for the airwaves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not original. Tries to be like Ocean's Eleven and fails. Easy to lose interest. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The major flaw if this series is the totally diluted (and lost) debate regarding the ethics of law enforcement. While the original film questions the existence of free will, this Minority Report series eliminates all possible debate and is your standard cop series with a touch of conveniently placed psychic powers. Such an awful and cheap approach. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show seems familar because it rehashs many other shows. Wyatt and the ER doc, are Carol and Dr. Ross from ER. Wyatt relationship with his dad has been done to death on numerous TV series. He partners problemws with his ex-wife brings to mind Jimmy and Kim from Third Watch. All the supporting cast seems to be make of parts from other medical show characters. The one good thing about the show is that it will take up time from summer reruns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its boring plotline along with such a weak premise makes it some of the most disappointing shows of the fall season. Not the worst, but I would have expected it to be much much better. The ideas are very unoriginal and you know that there must be better time-travelers elsewhere. The ideas are weak and dull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst shows I've seen in a long time. Cannavale should go back to being gay in "Will and Grace" cause he doesn't have enough acting to be on he's own show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Had really looked forward to Texas Rising - so much glorious content to work with - but watched the first two segments and was very disappointed.  Very little historical content and the "filler" was far to fanciful.  Found it disjointed and hard to follow - even for one who has some understanding of Texas history.  The background and landscapes were totally off.  Will not watch the remaining segments. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Leave it to Hollywood was really looking forward to show and was disappointed in the first scene. I live in south Texas and there are no canyons down here and to add insult to injury there are no mountains in Goliad. If your going to tell a true story at least get the background right. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a disappointment when you have  such a good cast.  The story and dialogue are weak and flat.  The two young characters are annoyingly superfluous as a side-story.  A total waste of my time. I will give the 2nd episode a try, but, I don't think it will suddenly develop into a story with teeth.  The reality of such poor stories and dialogue have had me watching the old movies since I was a kid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the worst written and screen played movies pertaining to the American history that I have ever seen. I almost believe it's an insult to the great state of Texas and the people who gave their lives to make it an American territory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just watched episode 3.  This is my last one.  Someone should ask for their money back, advertisers.  Like I said I won't watch the last episodes, seems less historical than glorified for certain characters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible, horrible.
"Don't Mess With Texas"
To bad the writers were not required to take Texas history and geography in high school like all Texans.
Yes, we have a unique accent,  but  not anything like this.
Goliad is 171 feet above sea level. NO MOUNTAINS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a hot mess of a disappointment. I think they were aiming at "Lonesome Dove," and they achieved "Back to the Future III." As a docent at the Alamo, I know a little bit about the story. Sadly, in the opening scene , they get it wrong by putting the battle on March 7 instead of the 6th. There are many, many more errors that completely take you out of the story. It is a good looking movie, but the characters do not have any depth. Many of these characters have real stories, but they are placed in scenes that are unhistoric. Save your time and read "Texan Illiad" by Stephen Hardin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Expected way more than what I've seen. From the fake telephone calls right in the first minutes of the show, where the lady is having a phone call with the iPhone's home screen icons plainly visible to some other inconsistencies and bad acting.

As a medical professional, I probably am a tougher audience to please - but I do expect medical shows in 2016/17 to be as realistic as possible and when possible, such as Grey's Anatomy and ER, where the actual procedures and patient related things were realistic and done as in real life.

The trauma guy from the first show is right there in the back of the ambulance, elbow high in patients blood, riding on a gurney while doing CPR, and yelling the vital signs to the hospital manager I guess (as she should do something with that), and all that in his plain clothes while other physicians on call watch him. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm only giving this show a 2 because of the lead actor, who I enjoyed in the cancelled series "Firefly". The debut of DRIVE was a big letdown. The plot and dialog was not believeable. A mother of one was going to kill one of the contesants and then backs out and the contestant actually joins her in her car, abandoning the group she was with. Come on! There are many screwy lines and unbelievable scenarios in this series. My prediction is it will not last. It has to be believable, and this show isn't! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Reminded me of the ridiculously funny Monty Python episode with the genteel sitting around a piano with copius amounts of blood. Have to agree with the comment about it seeming to have been written by a 13 year old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Saying this show is "300" on TV is an insult to the artistic creativity that was the "300" graphic novel and movie. "Spartacus" is a cheap, melodramatic pile of you-know-what. As someone who was entertained by movies such as "Gladiator" and "300," I expected to see some similarities between them and "Sparty: BS." I didn't expect to see nearly word-for-word replicas of lines and entire scenes from those productions. Hasn't "Sparty: BS" crossed the line into flat out plagiarism here? And if you are going to steal directly from other works, at least do it in a flattering manner! Pathetic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not the same show, Sorry but Andy Whitfield made the role of spartcus, to replace him with a much smaller man just did not do it for me. One thing the director for sure messed up on was showing that quick shot of the old Spartacus standing nude with a piece of meat  hanging down like a big ole' Alabama soup bone. Now when they show the new Spartacus, he bess have a **** you can hammer a railroad tie with or all the women are going to throw rocks at him, he  just does not command the scene the way Andy did, I'll tr 1 or 2 more episodes to see if he catches on but, I don't see it happening.  The new guy looks like a out of shape roofer, they should have used cgi to super impose Andy,s body frame size on the new guy at least, One other thing,The blonde, that hates Spartacus, the Alisssia or whatever her name is. The spartacus banged like a rag doll, until she found out it was Spartacus and not kirskis. I"LL bet good money she ends up with Spartacus again somehow, you know after Spartacus took that makaita jackhammer to her the way did, she thinks about that big ole, tool all the time and wants another shot at it, besides, she's carrying his baby.

"Married": This is what happens when Outrageous and Awkward go hang out at Bad Pacing's and play a game of Ewww.    . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well.... here goes.

I read The Sword of Shannara some 20 years ago around the age of 14. Loved it, but didn't end up re-reading it until recently. At about the halfway mark I heard of this series, and sought it out to watch it with low expectations due to the MTV tag.

Now I have watched it, and trying to get back to the second half of the book is quite difficult - especially because the show's portrayal of Allanon is SO different to how I pictured him in my mind. But that is quite subjective, so I can't hold it against the show. I hate to bring up "I read the book and this isn't as good", but there it is.

More objectively - as t's been said in many reviews this is a teen angst tale of nonsense, and it's a shame that Terry Brooks is tied so closely to it yet couldn't influence it to be... good. The characters are whiny, weak, and unbelievable on the whole. I was expecting the cast to glance at the camera throughout, checking they were doing alright. Even those few who have proven themselves in big-name big-screen films struggle to excite here.

The script contains every cliche you can think of - "Do you ever wish I was dead instead of my brother? I do, every day." Hackneyed scriptwriting of the worst degree all through. There is nothing original about this story whatsoever, and the setting of the four lands is wasted.

The production values vary from terrible to alright. The CGI effects can be quite nice looking, but at other times (especially blood - why after all these years can they still not make blood look real??) they break the viewer's involvement in events. There is a sheen over everything, leading to a feeling of polish that doesn't fit well with the genre. A pervading hard-lighting effect attempts to hide the clearly man-made nature of the sets and cheap clothes, adding to this feeling of excessive polish and taking away from believability of the setting. Several times (especially in expositional shots involving demons dotted through the episodes) there is a distinctly 90s feel in the direction, with warping effects on the camera making it seem 20 years older than it is.

Clearly I am not the target market for this show (odd - being a fan of the books, you'd think I'd be exactly the target audience), but I hope they scrap the whole thing and do no renew it for a second season. They need to get the message that it is possible to make something far better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't mind the acting BUT will someone please pay a-freaking-tention!!! Where the hell did he get a zippo!! Its been 3,000 years since they were made, not to mention the lighter fluid. Plus the guy was a brief character to begin with. And Rovers were gypsies in ALL of the books NOT cutthroat bandits. Paranor is ON a plateau in the middle of a dark FOREST! NOT a cave in the freaking dessert. There are only a few things I like so far about this series but I'm getting disappointed more every week. And by the way, Slanter the Gnome doesn't even appear until NEXT book with Jair who is WIL'S SON! Something better start going right soon............... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A show that seems to try and be a combination of Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, all wrapped up in what for me, was a rather boring mash up that failed to get off the ground in any meaningful way. Too much style over substance and even though I gave it 2 episodes, only part way through the first I wanted to turn it off. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience but I feel that even they will tire of it quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

flashy set pieces and immaculate CGI is not enough to save the show from bad... no, terrible acting, and a story that seems to disregard its original source material. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having read half of Brooks' books, this series equally disappoints as being plodding if not borderline boring. Wooden characters despite some great attempts by the actors are characteristic of Brooks' interesting plot lines, but he could not deliver timely, sharp development either in his books or this series. And what is the purpose of having a cliffhanger at the end when everyone who has read his books that Eretria will marry Wil and spawn a new generation, which will be the central characters of book two in the Shannara trilogy? If the "titillating" love scenes had been cut out, there would have been plenty of time to rescue Eretria, be present at their marriage, and kick-off a second monotonous season with two half-/quarter-/eighth Elf children wrestling mostly with their inner demons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The directing in this show would sink it even if it had no other problems.  The story is told, and the scenes are directed, in a fairly jumpy way without serving suspense or mystery.  The characters are pretty stock archetypes.  The "romance" is laughable.  It looks good at parts, till someone opens their mouth.  Occasionally sets look unfinished and they borrow imagery from Elder Scrolls Oblivion for some of their structures.  But I'm still watching it with my wife, making fun of it and pointing out new problems and guessing the plot.  It gets a 2 since we have managed to enjoy ourselves while watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not terrible.  I just have one question, and maybe this was actually in the book and the series completely failed to address it... Why did any of this need to take place?  Amberle is the seed.  She was in the tree in the first couple episodes.  Game over.  But instead, the tree sent her to San Francisco (the whole season) to tell her to go back into the tree where she started.  Nothing changed.  The didn't bring anything back.  It was all unnecessary.  Right???  Should be called: Pointless Journey or Wasted Road Trip. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've never read the books, and I still think this show is terrible. I found none of the characters likeable in anyway. The main character Wil is just too... perfect (reminds me of the blonde lead from Eragon). OK, so his mom dies and he heeds the call of adventure... but he's a naive half-elf. So he gets robbed, but instead of learning a lesson or gaining any character development, the robber ends up falling in love with him. And then he meets a Princess, who falls in love with hims. And my feelings for the two female leads can be summed up in Episode 7, when they are trapped in an underground room and they more or less say 'don't worry, Wil will come to the rescue'. Seriously? After building up the kickass girls thing in the first episode ('Girls can compete blah blah') and having a sassy human thief who also kicks ass; but then you still need to have them rescued (mostly) by the bland blond idiot with his three magic pebbles.

OK, so the CGI scenery isn't bad, but it's mostly used as establishing shots, where as everything else is just, forest or throne room or desert. The fighting choreography is awful and as are some of the magic effects. I've never seen a showdown between a (supposedly) badass knight guy and some hulking demon look so... dull. It was just swing, swing, stab in back. No tension, no 'is he going to defeat him'. And in all honesty no emotional pay off that a character sacrificed himself so the two idiot leads could walk to the end of the tunnel and wait for him to be killed.

John Rhys-Davies as an Elf King is just so funny that it keeps dragging me out of the story (he played the Elf hating Dwarf Gimli from LoTR in case you didn't notice).

The plot is kind of haphazard and doesn't fit together smoothly. There is no sense of scale on the journey and it devalues tension if the possibility of someone coming to help is only a scene change away.

Manu Bennett as Allanon actually feels like his character walked in from some good High Fantasy Film somewhere. His character actually seems to keep an emotional tone that fits consistently and is probably the one thing about this show I like.

All in all the Shannara Chronicles is a show that feels more like its capitalizing on the resurgence of the genres popularity. The blandness of the main characters (and their oh so perfect hair and clothes) would make this show all right for teenagers (12-15) but otherwise anyone looking for some good Fantasy fun, best move on elsewhere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'll keep this short, What a real disappointment. The editing and the directing is all over the place. I can tell it's a small budget by just how they overlap some much of the scenery. No real big pan aways that can slow the story down and let you enjoy the scenery.   It seems they just want to rush this story along, resulting in silly scenes that just disappoint time after time. They just don't make sense.  What a shame because the actual story is so important to the turn of the century. The beginning of the developing world of industry.  The actors do work hard and there are all pretty faces to look at. Very frustrating for me, but some how I got through it and well yes a waste of time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had to give up on this show after watching 4 episodes. There is no real character development and the story is pretty simplistic. The characters are just too one dimensional and the story is full of plot holes. Like how does the dude with the Greek/French accent keep popping up in Montreal and then back to the James Bay area in just a few days? Did he steal a portal gun from Rick & Morty? The whole thing is completely over the top. The last scene in the forth episode made me say, JHFC, why did I waste my time on this live action cartoon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Extremely disappointing.  Each show opens with trite and cliche political quotes from modern pop icons such as...wait for it...Ice Cube...an obvious attempt at backhanded commentary on our current political environment.  It's both predictable and needlessly distracting.  But this poor judgment call is only emblematic of the other problems of this show.

Many characters are predictable cookie cutter, politically correct manifestations. Indians=good.  British=evil.  Most women=good. Most men=bad.  Boooring!  Many characters are overplayed in attempt to portray them as ridiculously wicked, especially the British soldiers.

Also, the scope and scale of the story feel myopic and claustrophobic.  The story takes place across broad swathes of geography, yet we never get a sense for the wide space wherein this story takes place. As a result, the story misses essential context.

First Netflix original I couldn't complete.  What a shame. Such immense potential. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Haven't we already seen this only with THE DONALD?   Isn't there some other format you could give us?  And no, I don't mean another Survivors show.  You could FINALLY trash that one too.  And, no more singing  how much singing can we take?  Really look forward to the show America's Got Talent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Um, many of the crucial scenes in the film....never happened. Like when Osama is surrounded in Afghanistan and the Clinton administration didn't move on it. Never happened. How can made up facts about 9/11 get a good review? Easy, people still don't know the facts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The major premise was based on something that never happened, i.e., that the CIA and the Afghans had Bin Laden in their sights but let him go because the Clinton adminitstration wouldn't pull the trigger. None of it was true but it's in the movie anyway, so you've got to call it propaganda. As drama it was pretty weak, which is probably why it failed to get a big audience share. ABC really stumbled on this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In the manner not another teen movie made fun of the beat to death genre of a bunch of youths getting **** up with a **** underdeveloped story line, there should be a movie or show mocking this unoriginal series, and its many mediocre at best competitors, for its repetitive, corny, and adolescent comedy which features nothing, but a pattern of drug use, loss of clothing, and stupid idea which likely fails by the end of episode. The writers think drugs + young guys + failure = good TV, or ratings, no matter how half-baked the idea or actors are. Cast = nobodies. Funny at first until you realize the same exact recurring themes in every episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe i'm just not getting today's comedy...I have never laughed at this show. The characters looks funny and they look like they're doing funny things, but the laugh center in mah brain doesn't click. Maybe it's my diet? This show's about three or four friends I think they're friends with some boss lady. They get into awkward situations that they solve with lowbrow humor and stupidity. Maybe i'm missing the punchlines while I dig stuff my face with food. It's like they throw all this useless garbage at you hoping something will stick and make it worth watching. I've yet to laugh at anything on this show. Come on man! I'd rather watch The Mind of Mencia, or that show by Nick Swardson. I hope the creators don't pull some stupid move like saying it's "art" like those guys who made Tim & Eric did, causing all sorts of fanboys to use that as a defense on people like me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm at a disadvantage with this show. I'm in my early 30's and have graduated beyond the gross out sophomoric filler this show cranks out en masse. The problem for me is that, between the three main characters, there isn't really a protagonist in a pure sense. Plainly, these guys are unlikable and I found myself rooting for their downfall at every corner. I went to high school with guys like these. The only difference was that I graduated.  If you're a High School male or just post college male, this show is going to be the funniest thing you'll ever see. For me, I wasn't high enough to plod along with the forced nature of the "bro's". I wanted to like the show but, alas, I'm just too old for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is truly a time waster. The stupid, drunken humor works for some people but honestly I find this show mind numbing. The characters look funny and talk funny, but in the end nothing funny is being said or done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The scripts are getting painfully predictable as this show slogs on. A recent one involving an art heist from an art gallery was just embarrassingly sophomoric in its utter lack of knowledge about fine art or the gallery world. The steam has mostly run out of the boiler on what once promised to be a good locomotive of storytelling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I agree with the view that this show would have been better as a mini-series. Overall, the plot feels very forced and the social dynamics between the many disparate character types seem lacking considering the perceived "danger" that the dome presents. Once again Dean Norris is wasted in his role, he looks lost among the incessant pandemonium and it doesn't surprise me his character was ready to call it quits and leave this joke of an "epic" TV drama. Loved the novel so regrettably it ends for me after this lacklustre start to Season 2. I gave it too many chances to redeem itself in the end... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has it all: bad writing, bad acting, bad direction, bad special effects.  It's Lost in Space!  No, wait, I actually liked Lost in Space.  That show had Dr. Smith and Robot, and Under the Dome could sorely use them to save this mess.  I can forgive the horrible inconsistenices and cliche plot devices if I can root for the characters.  But honestly, there isn't a single character on this show - good guy or villain - who is unique or interesting in any way.  I don't care about any of them.  The closest they get is with Big Jim, and his act has already gotten old.  This show really proves how important writing and character development are, when you look at Dean Norris' performance as Hank in Breaking Bad and compare that to the drek he must deliver as Big Jim in UTD.  The rest of these characters are TV Trope 101.  Barbie, Julia...who cares?  None of these characters have a personality or any kind of hook, and just go through the motions of reacting to the latest drama of the week.  At least they killed off Sheriff Linda early on in season 2.  She has to go down as the dumbest tv cop of all time.  Even the teenage characters are lame, they have the collective personality of a brick.  In the space of two weeks, Joe is separated from his parents, had his house ripped apart, and found out his sister was hacked to death by an axe-murderer, and he's making out with a chick in the woods when not eall gung-ho trying to solve the mystery of the dome.  All of the teen characters are boring and unappealing, it makes me long for old Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes where you had teen characters like Xander and Willow who were actually entertaining.  This show is utterly humorless for a story about a town under a dome that begs for occasional comic relief.  I mean, seriously, we're talking about a town in a fishbowl here.  The Simpsons got it right.  On the whole, UTD is just bad soap opera set to a Stephen King story, and feels like they just make it up as they go along, a la Lost.  I hate myself for watching it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Made it to episode 3 before giving up on season 2. They must have thrown money at the actors to get them to return for a second session because season 1 was pretty bad. It's getting a "Lost" vibe (random stupid things happening). Network TV might no be the best place for a Stephen King TV series considering the graphic nature of the novel. More blood and horror would help this series but not save it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I came back for season two willing to forgive the bad writing, direction and acting of season one, but nothing has changed. If anything, it seems to be getting worse by the episode. Under the Dome will go down as one of the worst television shows in living memory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really, really awful. It was attempting something funny but just veered into "being offensive for the sake of it". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yikes. I play fantasy sports and this looked like it could be good. But it was just sloppy and stupid. I turned off after half the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not very good at all, but Whitney is like SUPER cute. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible....horrible tv serie.  Witches who can't use magic? How convinient... No extra costs for special effects.
Vampires who look like they've just took a sunbath? ( none are white/pale looking) Vampires that walk in daylight because of a ring? how convinient again...! No fangs visible...once again, no extra production costs.
They try to make a vampire/witches serie, but they are appearntly on a tight budget. The result? A loooot of talking bla....bla...bla. A few special effects and boring storyline. It's horrible.....just a horrible tv serie. Please put it out of it's misery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The central point of the show is that an adopted son of a major gang-related crime family is set up as a mole for the family inside the police department's special gang task force.  Bit of a stretch, but OK, until said mole is repeatedly publicly seen with members of the gang family and is about as under cover as a fluorescent ceiling light.  I turned it off -- the show not the light --  after ten minutes but later decided to stick it out for the full length.  A mistake! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I dislike this show. I'm watching it only in hopes it gets better, and I'm bored.
I'm tired of shows (Gang Related-The Bridge)writing dialogue in English, and directly translating it to Español.
We (Mexican Americans) do NOT speak like that...
We/they have syntax that makes sense in Spanish.
You might have Mexican American actors, but at least get some speech coaches.
Or do some due diligence, watch some Mexican Daytime soaps...
They actually speak the language... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't think this show has anywhere to go after they solve the mystery of who killed Vivian. What are they gonna talk about? I don't think this show is like Revenge, but I don't like it much either. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As I am laying peacefully on my couch, I suddenly here a horrific noise coming from upstairs.  I thought an animal was dying and went up their only to find my father watching this trainwreck with the volume up to an alarming level to compensate for his hearing loss.  The horror, the horror.

Now I am sure that Carrie Underwood is a lovely person and a damn good singer, but she is a horrible,, horrible actress.  She was missing notes, starting and stopping too early, and was out of breath from having to "act", which along with the god awful production values sung this thing in to William Hung's wheel house.

I cannot believe how bad this was.  All that talent on stage lead a lot of people like me to raise their expectations to a higher level than they may have been without a cadre of known, established actors.  It was a massive disappointment.

While many may be inclined to prefer disappointment over outright dislike, but this is only true if the movie is on is above average.  When the film in question is below average, disappointment sets in and exponentially increases. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really disappointed in this, one of the only shows of the new season that I thought could be worth watching. Why on earth did they decide to start the series with Crusoe already on the island? Already friends with Friday? And the plot of the overly bloated 2-hour premiere was a lame search for pirate treasure, with the least frightening villains I've seen on TV in a long time. This show as a real dud. It seemed to want to do a Hercules/Xena thing at times, but it lacks all of the charm of those great series. It was just one bad decision after another. Too bad. I wanted to like this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible re-invention of the Daniel DeFoe novel. With so may characters landing on the island you must ask the following question: Is this Crusoe's island or grand Central Station? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cheesy, cliche, and poorly made. Sadly, targeted towards young kids.  Really wanted to like this but could not even make it through the season.  An insult to the original series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not worth the watch...even for a loyal Heroes fan. This is not a reboot, as advertised...it's a disjointed, poorly written, continuation of the already lost plot line of Heroes. I loved season 1 of Heroes...great character development, smartly used special effects, and a larger plot line that was engaging. This edition has none of those characteristics. I found myself losing interest in the story line about 15 minutes into episode 1. In fact, outside of the man in the horn rimed glasses, I could care less about anyone on the show. Most of the new faces are unlikeable and some are just down right boring. Sadly, this one is getting deleted from my DVR. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of the original Heroes , I feel insulted by this level of crap they're offering us.
Just bits a pieces from all over just put together in a humiliating effort to make something like the original , but it fails epically , this piece of junk is a shame for the original cast members who are taking part of the reboot.

Right from the beginning and throughout the show we see people with stupid powers that doesn't fit in the Heroes world ; a man that turns into smoke !! really!! , another that regenerate a whole new human being by cutting any piece of himself !!! yeah and he regenerates with the same clothes and equipment W..T..F !! who writes this $#it ?!!! , not to forget the Japanese girl who transfers herself into a game ...OMG that's the worst one .

Even the editing is a huge failure , and the graphics are so dated and cheap seems like it was done in the 90's.
one of the worst writings I have ever seen, what a shame.

I really wish they'd kill this show before they ruin it even more , please please kill it and let us keeps the good memories of the original HEROES. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have watched the entire season hoping to find something smart and I found Superman IV the Quest for Peace kind of laziness in terms of writing instead. The flashback to the past could have revealed that the twins holding a taco together at Woodstock leading the taco to fly freezing the solar wave would save the world and somehow it would be much more smarter than coming up with what they went along with. I mean the guy who figures out that he can send radiation beams a few days ago starts flying and bombs the solar flare with full confidence. Heroes Reborn should stop trying to portray a universe and focus on fewer characters with less impressive powers - Heroes first season was good because all the characters were in a realistic environment and they had real people problems and they had a phase of figuring things out.  There was mystery because there was something left for imagination - not dozens of people who seem to change powers as it is necessary for the plot for the sake of showing mediocre CGI effects. The Fifth Element, which is 1997 movie, had better CGI and they did not have to steal the ending of Heroes Reborn.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After watching 'out of practice' I am suprised it came from the same people who wrote some of the best epsiodes of Frasier. I only laughed once during the whole show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tired, and over rated. This show was great for two or three years but now it is like watching a fish stuck on land gasp for air. It is truly a piece of pop culture that should die. On the bright side of things usually in every episode there is one great joke, so i give it a two for the one joke that makes me laugh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Family guy out stayed it's welcome long ago, with mix and match jokes and dry humor. You're not clever for getting the jokes, as any one who's past age nine can as well. If this review was on the shows performance, it'd get a 10, as the ratings are insane. But for the how itself, it just isn't funny, or even entertaining. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, family guy is worse than that one other show that has nothing to do with this statement and is just in here for comedic value, even though the joke is **** and only 10 year  olds would find funny! Oh wait thats Family Guy too. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HURT MYSELF AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. More like ahhh when the **** is this **** joke going to end? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Heavy on pop culture references and cheap cutaway gags that give nothing to the plot. Family Guy is truly the spitting image of lazy writing. While the show may manage to make you chuckle once or twice it never manages to overcome it's paper thin plots and one dimensional characters. Lacking plot and character development and filled with irrelevant gags Family Guy becomes tired quick. Family Guy is a show tries it's hardest to push boundaries just for attention, making it nothing more than an obnoxious mess.

While an everyday middle school student may have a good time. Most over the age of 15 will find themselves changing the channel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its lost its magic, and is not the family guy from years ago. Its hard to recommend anyone see season 11+ of Family Guy, its just not funny like it used to be, characters are used in dragged out plots that are unoriginal now and guest stars are used as plot fillers in some episodes. Some episodes have humor that is just not even humor, just dark and sad and the plots are really bad now. Peter used to be dumb funny and now he is just dumb....

-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a huge fan of the books, i was looking forward to the show, but was completely disappointed with it. They don't follow the books at all, they create new creatures or powers in every book and change the ones the characters actually do have, the actors need to mature, and the new stories they create are completely childish and cheezy. I can't believe T. Goodkind would let his books turn into this filth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are in anyway a fan or reader of the Sword of Truth books I cannot recommend strongly enough that you avoid this series. People who haven't read the books will probably find this show average, maybe even watchable. To fans, however this show is an appalling mess of the worst parts of the book, missed plot points, bad character development, bad acting and forced action. To sum up the eventual train wreck of a plot, the very first episode commits a number of fatal mistakes which brings down Goodkind's story tumbling down like a pack of cards. To name a few, Richard's farther is alive (wasn't killed by Darken Rahl), he isn't friends with Zedd, He hasn't memorised the book or even seen the book before (Confessor is now useless). The boundary is now a trivial thing that can be broken through with a few catapults. The story is so far removed its easier to say that its an entirely unrelated story where everybody inexplicably has the same names as in the book. To summarize. Forget the show, read the book. If you've already read the book, still forget the show but do something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The whole Sword of Truth franchise is crushed in the pilot episode. Legend of the Seeker is more of a relaunch of the Hercules/Xena setting than anything else. Just a couple of the characters from the books are used. By name. If you have read the book you will probably want to stay away from this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Sword of Truth Series has been my favorite book series for years. That being said I expect that a tv adaption would require the book to be changed to fit the requirements of a screen play. What I would not expect is a butchering of character and plot development. I would also not expect the basic philosophy's found in the book to be diminished or entirely removed. I'm sad to say that I will not be watching the rest of the series though I would have loved to see Terry Goodkin's world brought to life but unfortunately this series slanders his works and his name. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried watching it under the context that it was a different story from the books. On three separate occasions I have tried watching it and was too bored. I felt like turning off the tv was a more productive thing to do. Why isn't it a 1? The sword fight was sick. But i don't think I could watch the show just for that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, after Episode Three i killed the entry in my DVD recorder timetable. Sad, because Sword & Sorcery is a genre I like a lot, from Fritz Leiber through Robert E Howard to Tanith Lee. How on earth could anyone produce an S&S show that is so horribly, excruciatingly bad? - fractured plot, unbelievable characters, absurd back-story, every incident plagiarised and then wrecked by some stupid trivial change. So I finally did my homework, and found out why -= it was "based" on a story by Terry Goodkind - a prolific user of word-processing tools who might become a writer if he ever learns how to write his way out of a paper bag. Nope, I'll wait for the cartoon remake with Alvin and the Chipmunks, surely far more suited to the starring roles than the present hopelessly inept human cast. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had really high hopes for this show but was rather disappointed  in the entire show's structure and almost everything. The humor seems rather stale and is quite bland. This was definitely one of the shows that went at the bottom of my list of must-sees. It was even more surprising when ABC Family renewed it for a second season after it's extremely low viewer ratings. In my overall opinion it was a huge mistake bringing this show back when ABC Family could have replaced it with another more promising show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found NO reason to care about these boys. Not compelling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Haven is a small town with a case of "The Troubles". Unfortunately the troubles don't originate within the town but within the writing. Even the phrase "The Troubles" is painful. It's like something a loathed aunt would say to you if you had a stomach ache. It is almost as bad as the term "werepanther" from True Blood. Almost.The story centers around 3 characters: An FBI agent, a local cop and a smuggler who investigate problems that arise in a port town of Maine. It sounds like a decent set up for television series but the characters are bland, they have no chemistry and the script is so nasty it continues to push you out of the story as you shake your head in shame and disbelief. At points in the series you can just see the anguish in the actor's faces as they have to work their way through scenes that make no sense within the story or their character.The series feels like the writers have no one editing their work. No litmus test for realism or consistency. The characters swap love interests faster than a daytime drama, and that is no easy feat. By the end of the first episode Audrey is ready to leave the FBI behind to dive deep into Haven's mysteries. I could see it coming but it makes no sense. She has spent a lifetime becoming an FBI agent to throw it away on a photo a couple of news hacks show her. Who writes stuff like this? And every episode has gems like this.After the third episode I actually decided to turn the show into a drinking game. Every time a character would say or do something stupid I would take a drink. There has yet to be an episode where I don't finish a beer.I would say this show is a vision of the future when emotionless robots take over and write television dramas but that is an insult to robots since they must, by design, be logical and this show rarely achieves that.Unless you are looking for a laugh, a drink or an example of writing gone horribly wrong skip this and tune into fringe or x-files reruns. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry to say, this is a bad TV show. I confess that I only saw the 1st episode, and even that was too much for me. It's kind of a wannabe Hercules, but in a bad way. Add 5 points to my score, if you're between 5 and 9 years old and subtract 2 if you're over 30. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the show the BBC wanted to replace Merlin, and its failed.
Its a truly awful show, lack of connection with any of the main characters, some truly awful casting decisions.. Medusa was meant to be beautiful, not average.. and whoever made Mark Addy, Hercules needs to be fired.
I hope this show ends soon, and they replace it with something else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh yes! ... I mean "Oh no!" ... I mean "Oh hell no!" They're still back after a few flops here and there. Pretty much that's Syfy logic for you, but why are we getting a fourth one? Don't they already know their franchise is failing? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never understood the market for purposefully bad movies; "so bad its good" often only stems from earnest incompetence rather than camp schlock. In other words, this movies is trying too hard to achieve that cult status of bad, and like anything that tries too hard, it becomes irritating very quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A show about a bunch of whining brats, oh how entertaining?! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

NO! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How can you reimagine something when you clearly have no imagination? Heck even the score is recycled from Stargate SG-1. If you want a reimagined Oz read "Wicked" -- this piece of junk has put the Sci Fi Channel back 10 years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow that was bad. Poorly acted and poor story line. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Richard Dreyfus must have really needed a paycheck. It would be helpful if some of the actors could deliver a line as well. What a waste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Flying monkeys flew out of the Sorceress's titties! It went downhill from there, so to speak. This isn't remotely like the Wizard of Oz, it just references it in some way every 15 seconds. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Definitely did not live up to my expectations. Watching the flash program on the website repeat for 2 hours would be a more entertaining use of your time. Poor script, mediocre acting from a cast that is capable of much more, and low-budget special effects that are at times painful to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For all it's apparent money and resources, Sci-Fi's original programming uniformly sucks. Everytime I see an ad for a new show or original movie they are promoting, I get a sick feeling in my stomach. It's no surprise that "Tin Man" is the latest in their unrelenting line of pro form a schlock. Let's pray they don't get the rights to The Dark Tower. That would be a real shame. Such a waste that network's programming is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Beautiful sets, horrible acting. Zooey Deschanel (Dorthy) delivers lines like nails on chalkboard. Anyone involved should have shut down production, but for some reason they continued filming while this actress butchered the flick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Supremely unentertaining. Not worth your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I looked forward to this thinking the contestants might need an iota of intelligence--unlike the loathsome "Deal or No Deal". Sadly, a cute setup is wasted. My two year old, pet monkey, and dead grandmother could all win on this "quiz" show. That's how complex the questions are. One lady gave me a real chuckle, when answering she said "My sixth grade science teacher would be proud...." Even she had this show pegged, a grade school education will get you far. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Questions so easy even a monkey could answer them don't deserve a reward. Nor does this show deserve to stay on the air. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Edit: So, I originally rated The Mist a 5, after the pilot, but now, having seen three episodes, I am forced to apologize. Steven Spielberg couldn't bring this mess up to 5. It is truly one of the most poorly written, directed, and acted presentations I have ever been suckered into watching. Just awful. Every single person responsible for this debacle should be dragged into an onion field and buried alive.

Original review follows:

Watching The Mist, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to escape the feeling that you've been dragged into Under the Dome 2.0. (Let's remake Under the Dome, with far less attractive people! Genius!) It's like someone took all the characters from Under the Dome, broke them into their component parts, and then rebuilt a set of slightly different people using all the same pieces in a slightly different configuration. For example, the soldier with the hidden past and the misunderstood criminal are two different people this time, instead of just being Dale Barbie. The Dome is a cloud of fog this time, but the result is pretty much the same - a small town is isolated by a supernatural force, and (gasp!) the people turn out to be the real monsters. It's a simplified version of a post apocalypse story, a genre that is itself the height of simplification fantasy.

As the years pass, it becomes increasingly clear how much autobiography King puts into his books. He writes stories about good natured **** ups and yokels who get in over their head with powerful forces, which is exactly the relationship he himself seems to have with Hollywood. Notice it took G.R.R. Martin, a guy who writes about power and how to wield it, one try (one!) to get a good television adaptation, whereas King has been trying to convert his books into live action for almost forty years, with only a single good movie (Stand By Me) to show for it.

I would say that the most interesting thing about The Mist is the act of watching it. I've never seen anything that felt so much like a rerun, despite being, technically, a new show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its just awful! So much could have been done with stephen kings the mist and another potentially great series is ruined!! The characters are flat and annoying as hell. Its the typical new TV show today, the characters bash god, blah blah blah . how original? How flat can you be? nice job on ruining a great story! Could have been soooooo much better. Its like watching a crappy science fiction with retarded characters. The story is just so bad. I cant get over it. still have not seen anything cool. HBO should have done this.  Its time to start holding movies and tv shows to a higher standard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The actors were good but not good enough to overcome stupid writing and and stupid characters. Tedious pop philosophy that belongs somewhere in the 1930s in the Boonies was not just boring - it was insulting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It get's a one for the set and another for the acting. The writing is just terrible. The show's angst last night was the captain needed a pep talk??? Holy crap this just stinks. Love the idea of a secret entity picking the crew - why can't said entity come up with the billions of dollars this mission supposedly cost? Just dumb. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. Terrible acting, terrible execution of plot, waste of my life. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This tripe is supposed to be comedy?  I kept watching waiting for it to be so but I found no humor whatsoever.
Surely the writers of this show can come up with something better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Haters Back Off is an unfunny comedy. With decent acting, horrible writing, and horrible characters. I had to stop watching at the 3rd episode it was just that bad and I have not watch any episode scene. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen on a TV show.  This isn't funny.  It's tragic.  You have a young delusional woman in need of a major course correction in an environment where her uncle is a spaz and her mother is a weak push-over.  They both contribute to the problem.  The main character has zero dimension or character arc; she is just a weak stick figure from one show to the next that you can't really do anything with.  Who the frig had money and thought this was a good idea!?  Even the 'Cone heads' barely had enough to put a movie together with and this is a fraction  of the potential of that!  As a comical satire, it's too over-the-top.  On YouTube, a few minutes here or there is fine but it doesn't translate well to TV. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not sure what the point of this show really is. "Animals," they're just like the terrible neighbors you try to avoid. That could be the tagline based on the pilot, which was about Rats having parties, doing drugs, and trying to hook up. Ugh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This paper features the usual abuse of women as a central them, including the gross sexualized treatment of women by a serial killer.  I did not think the lead was that interesting, but hard to tell in this very abrupt treatment with little to no character development.  I won't watch it again--unpleasant, and yet I watch a lot of murder mystery type shows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Silly. That's the best way I can summarize this. The (very artistic) trailers seemed promising and got me interested, but the first episode - especially the second half of it – left me really disappointed. The feel from the trailers was nowhere to be found and without giving spoilers, I felt the story/characters did not make any sense and didn't feel believable at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the stupidest display of pseudo comedy yet! Even people who are living in Spakane WA can't possibly find anything even marginally amusing in theis stinker. With any luck we wonlt have any more exposure to the nonfunny half hour. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was not entertaining. It was quite sad. I wish they would've chosen more confident, and better dressed women. I also could've done without the hieght and weight revealed. Ugh! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the beauties about downloading TV, rather than watching it live is you can skip through the tedious bits and see what happens at the end. What happens at the end of this one is the show gets cancelled because it's all tedious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is painful to watch.  It takes everything you like about the original The Walking Dead, and **** on it... very, very slowly.  I hate this mess.  And if it gets cancelled, you just KNOW they are going to pull that "It was only ever meant to be two seasons anyway!" ****  FLOP. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

To put it bluntly, this spinoff sucks.  I stopped watching it. The actors are not invested in their roles. This may be due to direction.  Only one character stands out and that is Reuben Blades. He is a consummate actor.  The Meredith character has one facial expression.  The kids are just annoying and that scene on the beach when they are going through the debris from the plane wreckage was like watching a scene from the old "Beach Blanket Bingo".  The whole production seems like a task given to a bunch of people who weren't on board with this project from the get go.  Either up your game or pull the plug.  You're embarrassing yourselves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is far more useful to detect shills (idiots giving reiviews for money/favor), than actually figuring out that Kirkman is an idiot and that Frank Darabont is the only reason the original show is as popular as it currenly (though soon to be massively declinining) is.  IGN is one of the most paid-for-reviewers out there they they could not help but give this an 8.5.  What a frakkin' joke!    Avoid at all costs.  Your time, and your sanity is worth more than the gore-fest that they devolve into by the end of this pathetic piece of trash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Astonishing that Clive Owen, and Nucole Kiddman's agents did not nothing to stop the release of this film. HBO, while generally creating some of the best television, has failed with Hemingway and Gellhorn.This film will surely be at home with the B movie crowd that will no doubt make fun of the often stupid dialogue and poor acting. Th bombing love scene  between our stars was especially moving... bowl moving! Lar Ulric makes an appearance as a film maker with an accent that can only be described as worse than the Irish Spring voice-over.  Pure and simple.. Hemingway and Gellhorn was the worst Ive seen from HBO. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh, painfully bad. I want to like this show, but I can't because its chock-full of cliches, annoying characters, and horrendous writing. Ex: mysterious rich pretty girl? come one Ex: Tripp makes me want to punch him in the face
Ex: Midgets, seriously?
Ex: Ark nicely fills the "Corporation-with-a-hidden-agenda" spot
The lack of creativity in the characters and in the whole show is an appalling squandering of what this show could have been. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First episode  was okay. It got interesting  and then 6 episode, no offense why do rich people open their back door and how the hell do you not feel a present behind you. The bear was breathing hard and this show just got stupid. Like They make it seem like americans are stupid lol 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While I know there can be room for disagreement between people of good faith, giving this "show" a 100 rating begs the question of who is in bed with whom! The acting? By far, the best actors are the animals. The "writing?" Not much in evidence. The concept? Well, others have said it better than I. Male lions are slothful layabouts who expect the females to do all the work. Bats actually cannot fly above 5000' because the air is to thin for their thin little wings. This show could be improved with the hiring of a highschool freshman science advisor. The humans depicted in this show so far largely deserve extinction... by any means! All that said, my son and I watch it as a "guilty pleasure," it's kinda like the great "Mystery Science 3000" series in that regard. Watch it and make fun of it in real time! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Contrived plots, terrible dialogue and flat acting wrapped around a few interesting concepts. That this show has such high ratings is just depressing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the most boring, predictable shows I have had the mispleasure of watching. Sadly, as my wife loves this sort of tat I do have to sit through it each week and it generally goes like this..Step 1: Present day re-enactment of Grimm's Fairy TaleStep 2: Detective Burkhardt is on scene and sees someone's face turn into a really bad cgi monster face.Step 3: He speak to the monster, they act scared of him..even though he has exhibited no monster slaying skills what-so-ever thus far in the series.Step 4: He goes and speaks to dog boy, Eddie, who knows everything about everything and then they go to beat down on the bad guys.Step 4: They get separated, the detective defeats the bad guy while teaching us all a morale lesson.Step 5: End of show and we all look forward to the exact same formula next week ..whoohoo!So yes, it offers nothing original or interesting, the writing is laughable and the effects worse than Charmed (another favourite if Mrs Tachikoma) and all in all a waste of NBC's money. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is **** I'm german and from Germany... and this show hasn't anything to do with hte fairytales of hte Brothers Grimm. The use of werewolfs is just pathetic. It doesn't give credit to the legend of the Brothers Grimm. Keep away from the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Formulaic, boring, the heroine lacks credibility, the plots are thin and the co-stars chemistry is non-existent. CSI sets the standard; this one doesn't even come close. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another of the many shows with testosterone charged women playing wanabee cops. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why strong woman means hitting at least one person per episode for some tv writers? And Brennan is perfect at everything and the flaws (aka treating people like crap because she can) it's because her parents went missing and she close herself. As a woman, please, dont write more this pseudo feminist shows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible feminazi fest, improbable plots, predictible stories, stereotypical characters, fantaisist technologies, wooden lead role... What's not to like? Gave it a 2 because of Boreanaz. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

inane writing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't want to give this rate because of Boreanaz, but the woman lead can't act: she either has the wooden expresion that means thinking or the teary eyes because of her family. The plots are predictable and they have their own universe, because there's no rule of known science is used here. Poor Boreanaz 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bloody AWFUL. Female lead absolutely CANNOT act. Perhaps the worst crime drama currently on the air. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this is the x files2!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG...I'm in so much shock. Being an avid SOA fan and After so much anticipation for this show, what a let down. The first scene (dream) was an absolute waste and shouldn't have been shown at all in my opinion. That actors "war cry" was more like a welp cry. If you don't have the conviction to do it, cut it out. Ugh. And while Katey Segal was absolutely brilliant in SOA, she doesn't feel right for this part at all. Perhaps it's the bad accent? Whatever it is, she doesn't fit. Stephen Moyer is great and more natural in this (I wasn't a fan of him in Trueblood). My favourite character is the guy who loves the animals and talks to them. And let's not even get started on how poorly done that white/grey castle in the background (and up close) is. Heck, when the band came across their entire village being killed, I felt like they lost their livestock...it was so bad (especially the primary actor). This felt like I was watching a high school play. Some actors were believable, but I think the failure here is on Sutter for how it plays out in the end. I hope they flesh it out and I hope it becomes brilliant...I don't think I will keep watching it though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Basically, this show is poor attempt to write a story around torture porn.   Peg Bundy is miscast. She provides the show with a bad accent and even worse acting.  I liked Sons of Anarchy so I thought I would this a try, but I'm out after three episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Any children forced to watch this for 3 hours must have been very, very bad.  Williams was just adequate as the peter-less Pan, seemingly midway through the gender reassignment surgery, but delivered an overall flat performance lacking Peter Pan's boyish enthusiasm.  Walken was sleep walkin' his way through a Neverland set that looked like a peacock had exploded, dazed and confused as usual, doing his best Christopher Walken SNL impersonation. His Hook was dressed like an extra from the King and I.  Props to his makeup crew which used no restraint whatsoever in applying the white powder.  The live aspect of this production obviously is a gimmick to encourage live viewing and the now obligatory live tweeting but it lent nothing to the experience, especially with the ubiquitous and very jarring and clunky commercial interruptions..  Way too long, way too boring, cheesy looking Sid and Marty Kroftt like sets and dull performances from everyone except Wendy.  C- grade. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Of course Peter Pan won't grow up -  he's been castrated!  In a  role made for Justin Bieber- Williams butches up with a sweet voice, while Walken's Hook gets in touch with his feminine side doing Rex Harrison. The Darling's drop into an island raining lost boys men , dancing pirates and prancing Indians --where Wendy wears her heart on her sleeve and a kiss is a thimble. Is it any wonder during a Walmart commercial Sabrina asked her husband why he's playing with a fairy. I believe in musical theatre so I hope it lives on. But this killed three hours of my time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

boredom.  Was looking for more real horror drama, not this.  I couldn't make it through more than 20 minutes without stepping away and coming back later.  I learned a whole lot more and had way more fun when I visited her museum and her house. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its great casting and light on the incest but other than that it was annoying that someone said "shes pretty she couldn't possibly have committed a crime" ......making it the most annoying thing over the "commoners have always been ugly" line from Desolation of Smaug 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dialogues taken directly from hell, silly costumes, ridiculous action, and a total lack of wit make this a true carnival of the undead: I didn't expect much from this one thousandth reenactment of the old Dracula story, and after watching the pilot I can honestly say it fulfilled all my expectations.
If you can get around the bad script and the tasteless production, your score probably depends on whether you like the star, Rhys Meyers. I, for one, absolutely adored him in Woody Allen's "Match Point", but as Dracula, he behaves a little like an adolescent attempting to impress his older brothers, hissing one manly statement after the other, with his eyes half closed, desperately hoping that none of them sees through his charade. So no, that doesn't do anything for me either. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful show. Stupid and not funny! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

American Dad might have been too much when it came out. Now Family Guy is boring, American is too...NOW they come out with this?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The jokes are not funny, the characters are very stale and boring, and the episodes are just stupidly written. It's pretty much a more rascist version of Family Guy. I'd rather watch Sit Down, Shut Up. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. I think this can avoid cancellation due to its Family Guy ties, but I for one won't be watching again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just terrible, from a big Family Guy and American Dad fan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horribly unfunny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Even if you're still a fan of Family Guy after 9 or so Seasons, you're really going to struggle to last through any episode of The Cleveland Show. Giving a spin-off to such a minor character always felt like a bad idea, and it becomes downright terrible when they change what little personality Cleveland had into being an unlikable jerk. He's now got the irresponsibility of Peter and the smothering father characteristics of Stan. The rest of the cast are practically clones of the Family Guy cast; flat mom, fat son, talking baby, talking animal, group of 3 drinking buddies, with the daughter being a copy of the Hayley from American Dad. Add to that unfunny jokes that lack the silliness of Family Guy or the timing of American Dad, uninteresting plots, forgettable episodes and characters; you've got such a lacklustre show it could only be described as "The most pointless spin-off ever". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show wasn't at all funny. Why they would make a spinoff series with the most boring character on the show (besides Meg of course) is beyond me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We watch the other two shows.  The LA version has pretty outrageous plots but at least the characters are interesting.  The New Orleans version has both bad writing and bad acting.  Its almost unwatchable its so bad.  The stealth pilot NCIS episode wasn't bad but the first two episodes of the spinoff were not nearly as good.  One more clunker and its off the Tivo. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has several faults beginning with the writing which is absolutely horrible.  The dialogue reminds me of a grade school play.  The actors are okay at best, but the accents are silly.  The only things of merit are the plot lines which actually believable.

Lucas Black repeatedly acts as if he has been caught by his Mom reading dirty books.  Scott Bakula just does not portray an individual of authority as Agent in Charge.  Zoe McLellan is the only one worth keeping, and should transfer to the D.C. unit to join Gibbs and Company.

I'm done with New Orleans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am sorry to be so harsh but as an experienced NCIS viewer I cannot watch this spin-off. The acting is terrible, as are the accents. NCIS with Gibbs, Tony or Ducky is always in the episode in one way or another. The story lines are transparent, predictable and little effort has been provided for authenticity. For example, the Lieutenant on scene with her badge on the wrong side. As a retired MP this irked me. Stealing episodes from NCIS like Bubonic Plague? Tony already did that one. Honestly I feel that you should have stopped at NCIS: L.A. I have removed this show from my DVR. It is sadly a time consumer when I have other shows to watch. My apologies to the cast that earns a living but I'm just not feelin' it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of NCIS, and I love Scott Bakula and CCH Pounder. But the script, the accents, and the dude with the Alabama accent are absolutely too much!
Let New Orleans be New Orleans. Let Bakula be himself. Cump the corny accent. Let the STORIES carry this series, and it might have a chance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

NCIS is going for the longest series since the westerns of old days...
I think your time is better spent making the world a better place than to watch this poor excuse for entertainment.. The writer directors are drunk, or burned out on rewriting old sitcoms now days...
It's time to move on to better, programs... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have started to watch the first show and all I can say is "Are the girls in the convertible from the "short bus"? To start on a premise that anyone would stay at the seen of escaping prisoners next to a perfect running vehicle is on par with the stupid horror teens that always go into the dank dark cellar or other ominous area instead of fleeing the obvious "seen of the soon to be crime"!  I don't believe you can start this stupidly!  Scott Bakula is too old for this character and having a gun with a name is 60s western lore ,what a joke!  Gibbs' character is ready for retirement and Bakula is in the same age range,this is not well thought out.The starter for this atrocity with N. C. I .S .giving the Premier a boost was laughable. I can't say enough of how unfortunate this show is!  I certainly hope they get enough money to hire a real writing staff . I give it a score of two,that's2 same as a Scooby- Doo episode I hope this was enough words to be posted as I have no more to say! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wanted to like it but it is boring. Kid gets mad throws a car, run from police, etc. Slow and if wanted would watch the movie Fire starter. I'm done after four episodes. No plot movement, acting is ok, but same thing diff episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Waste of time. A very boring, forgetful, and unfunny show. Will not watch another episode unless they can make some big changes. The ending was in very bad taste. I would compare this to "THE NEW NORMAL" GARBAGE 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tedious is the word that comes to mind to describe what I thought of this show.   It was an effort to continue to pay attention as the show tripped and fell over itself. The Skip character is given far too much screen time for what the character adds to the show.  To paraphrase an old chestnut --- when Skip is on the screen, it is like five talented and well-scripted actors left the scene.

After watching the pilot, I removed the show from the "to be recorded" list on my DVR.   Then I decided to give the show a second chance, and recorded and watch the second episode, Skiplantic or something.

I suffered through the entire second episode, only to resolve to never waste my time on this show again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a terrible, terrible version of Harry Dresden's world. The characters are well off mark and far too many liberties have been taken, turning this into another obnoxious Sci-Fi original series. Dialogue and acting are mediocre as usual, and there's simply not enough engaging material to hold my attention. I'm not a very picky person when it comes to TV, for that matter. Please don't take this show as a representation of the novels. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's truly amazing that somebody liked the books enough to do the series but obviously has no interest in inclkuding any of the elments that make them such a great read. The pilot was so full of poor ideas and missed the point so much somebody must have made a great effort to do such a bad job. Here's hoping it gets better. But I'm not holding my breath! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can you write a two-hour TV story based entirely on your characters making totally stupid decisions – one after the other after the other?   “Complications” features an angry doctor and a street nurse, who both have the absolutely worst judgment possible.  I won’t go into details in order to avoid a spoiler review.  On the other hand I question whether or not anything can be written that would spoil this show any more than its writers and producers have accomplished.  I have tried, but so far I cannot think of a worse show on television.

Come on USA!  You are doing some pretty good stuff lately.  This one apparently sneaked through your quality control department. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bluntly speaking, this show is disorganized trash. I am not one of those that holds contempt for a project just because Seth MacFarlane is involved. In addition, I found Jonathan Ames' last show, "Bored to Death," somewhat amusing and charming. But they combined to make an unwatchable mess in "Blunt Talk." Patrick Stewart deserves better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm very disappointed with the direction the show has taken this season. It has now completely departed from the feel and the style of the first season. In the first season, each action that happened lead somewhere. Each action was important. Each person was important. Now it feels like the writers have completely forgotten the backstory of each of these characters -- completely forgetting that yes, other things have happened. The characters have all turned 180 degrees several times just for shock value. Sylar is an excellent example. I'm sick of this "He's good!" "No, he's bad!", "No he's good", "No, really, he's bad!" nonsense. Typically I do like the moral ambiguity presented when you have a good character doing something shady or a shady character doing something good, but the character is so 2-D, flipping his loyalties around so quickly is ineffective at best and terrible writing at worst. One could say the same thing for the rest of the crew -- HRG, Mohinder, Peter, Nathan, Tracy, Mama Petrelli. Terrible writing this season. I'm very disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There were a few intriguing elements but otherwise the season premier was a disparate mess. They have no regard for the characters they set up and too little patience to start them over. Instead, they just change characters (Suresh, for instance) on a whim by tactlessly and explicitly stating their emotions to suit whatever outlandish plot they've come up with next. When this show started out, I had such high hopes for it, but after that episode I'm completely disinterested. It's amazing how quickly they squandered the the goodwill and hope they'd earned from viewers and critics alike. Figure out where you're going more than a season in advance, then go there. And take your time letting that story develop, jeeze! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The third season is a textbook definition of "Jumping the shark". Either the writers don't care or they're just negligent. Way too much is happening way too quickly and things are changing way to drastically for the show to be meaningful or interesting anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a let down! Seems like the "lost" dilemma has ultimately reached this show. Something good gets diluted with hypothetical problems to somehow throw a twist in an already unanswerable question in order to stretch a show for a network. To make more seasons and more money. Seems like they are trying to do too much without staying true to the core of the first season. The Third Season is similar to this comment, a whole lot of words and fluff but doesn't make a lot of sense! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really don't see much of an improvement over last season so far, in fact it looks like it could potentially be worse. The premiere was cheesy, awkward and a little embarrassing to watch or even admit to it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Spare me the stupidity and the ensuing fanboy blindness that causes them to act like this show (and LOST) could do no harm. They're both masking inept writing with a false aura of intelligence. If people think either of these shows is a work of genius, rather written above a 4th grave level, what will they accept to be merely good? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible show. After all the hype, it turns out to mainly be an X-Files clone (although it doesn't hesitate to ripoff other shows/movies - Hellboy & Blade for starters). I decided to cut my losses midway through the second episode. The campy special effects may have worked for X-Files, but they definitely look dated now. The monster in the premiere episode was about as believable as Barney the Dinosaur. Tapping's accent and dyed hair sound and look silly. The daughter's hair looks like a wig and her acting is terrible. Michael Shanks/Dr. Jackson isn't so compelling that we need to see his clone as the male lead. How can you make a Geico caveman a central character? The panoramic views of England look like computer screensavers. Sanctuary may be the first show to "Jump the Shark" not once, but numerous times during the first episode.. Scifi needs to take the show off immediately and only bring it back when and if it has been recast and rethought from top to bottom. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

sorry amanda but your english accent stinks why try to talk in english when your raised in canada.goesnt make sense. as for the show that stinks as well nothing new or original 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor premise--Merlin, Arthur's contemporary? This show won't attract the Arthurian legend lovers. Gwen a maid? Cheesy sets & mediocre acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The CW, for the most part, has had a great season launching new shows. This is the exception. The pilot was murky, uninteresting, and very unclear. It was only by reading the plot synopsis that I realized this was some kind of religious mythology. The characters are flat and their mission is flatter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing about this show was interesting. The characters were boring and there was nothing about the show that made me want to care about any of the characters. I couldn't tell if the show was a drama or comedy. The whole premise was a little distasteful and after about 35 minutes I had enough. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This really is the most CW'ish show ever. Its like gossip girl with magic or Harry Potter if it was written by Stephanie Meyer. The characters are all so teen'ish and its all about their high school issues and conflicts. There is nothing to drive the plot along so its just so slow and boring. Unless you are a 14 year old girl or just want to see attractive characters going to school in somewhat slutty outfits, avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show manages with its poor casting, terrible lead, mediocre witing, and GOD AWFUL ACTING!!!
but still this show does have two Extremely Bright Spots in the form of two of its actors Gale Harold and Ashley Crow with the former being better than the latter. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the worst show ever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A golden globe for geena davis??? I havent seen such bad acting since Debbie did Dallas!!! The show is definatly pretty, but blatantly idealistic and so ubelievable as to regard its viewers as flag waving morons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

She is not believable as CinC. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this show is boring and completely unbelievable. I love geena davis, but this show is just bad! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

not very real, the writer's have no concept of our government and how it operates. I was a fan until last night on the korea problem...korea can not hit washington with a nuc, and china is it 's major backer they would never help the US in this case. The OHIO class sub would never be used to gather intel off the coast of korea...maybe a LA or seawolf... so if you want to get me back as a viewer get real!!!! or I'll just watch Fear factor 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For f*ck sake syfy, can you make anything that's not catastrophically bad. Now I'm worried you won't do the same mistake with "The Expanse" or "The Magicians" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The screaming kid is the worst child actor to come along since...Jake Lloyd. Other than Tricia Helfer holding things together on the acting front, this show was less believable than Sharknado. This isn't hard-core SciFi and it's not that there weren't an ample number of opportunities to really hit on significant subjects that might affect people in this situation. How do you handle being shut in; how do you manufacture all of the goods necessary to support 600 people for 10 decades; how do you handle feeding them; how do you maintain a reasonable chain of command? A nuclear reactor onboard? All of these could have been interesting but instead there is evidence of poor direction and in almost all cases, very thin acting credibility. All we get are how males dominate the sexual arena (and lots of it). I've got to say that life on the future planet will be incredibly dull and boring with this group. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stiletto heels at EVERY crime scene???!!!  Ple-e-e-e-e-se!  Get some reality into this show.  Megan needs to dress more appropriately to be taken seriously.  If she wants a role as a fashionista, she can go find one.  Her character is very difficult to like.  With the set up, she could be a sympathetic person, but all the airs and ego take it away.  I know she is a better actress...get some real writers, please! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute rubbish. When I'm not completely taken out of the experience as Blackbeard actually looks like your run-of-the-mill bald, senile old retireé with bad front dentures while also boasting a WHITE BEARD, I'm instead constantly reminded of the shoddy acting brought on with a poorly written script, using not only dialects but also phrases and philosophies from the 1800-1900~th century.

Mix all that in with the fact that the show has no nudity and little to no bounds on realism and you got Crossbones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to the Ranch. Sam Elliot? Absolutely. But I was disappointed. With the cast, this should have been a slam dunk. But they really missed the mark with this program.

Kutcher’s and Masterson’s roles were too much like those they had on That 70’s Show. The idiot and the burnout. It would have been nice to see them expand their acting and do something different.

Some of the biggest problems with the show are the stereotypical mistakes made by whoever is writing this. It’s set in Colorado. Then why is everyone trying to talk with some kind of drawl. Your theme song is ‘Mamas Don’t Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys’. Haven’t seen anything cowboy-like about this show.

I love Sam Elliot. Always have. But I can’t stand Beau Bennett. He’s a complete **** Why wouldn’t he be grateful that he has two sons on his ranch, helping him. Instead, he **** about everything they do. Why would they stay? Why wouldn't he teach them what to do? Besides, if those two men grew up on that ranch, at 34 and 35 years old, they'd know the basics of what to do.

And if the ranch was in such a bad monetary state, they would not drive 15 miles to town to drink beer every night.

Colt dating a 22 year old? Ick factor by ten.

Cowboys – true cowboys – have respect for women. Colt and Rooster have none. That turned me off their characters. I have lived my life around true ranchers and cowboys. This show is NOT representative of that kind of life.

There are just too many predictable plot points. The acting is forced. Overall, just a disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This series is starting to falter for me. All of the blood and gore is useless. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind violent shows. Just not at the expense of story and plot. It seems that (and sex scenes) is all this show has to offer nowadays.

I feel the other seasons had much more character development and immersive story. Now it’s just comp. animated fight scene after fight scene. Plus, the blood looks so fake. Looks like bright red paint at times.

I mean, Game of Thrones has violence and sex too, but never ever at the expensive of being lazy with their plot or story.

This show does not deserve a good rating. I’m going to stop watching it at this point 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Went down hill fast after the opening monologue and never regained its footing. Cheesy, schmaltzy, self-indulgent pabulum. The episode with the psychiatrist was probably the best one. The 9/11 episode? Unbelievably turgid. I thought the critics were being unduly harsh at first, but now I see why. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worst espionage intrigue series I can remember seeing. Although the locations are attractive, the writing and scene setups are abysmal. Hard to believe Ashley Judd signed on to this dog. How could she have not seen it for what it was after reading a script or two? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horror, I thought it was a comedy central show, but it wasn't, so then I got it clear, It was a SYFY's show (40log botox mother playing a james bond role?? it must be syfy), but it wasn't either, so I am horrorized because I don't know WTF is that 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I started watching this show bearing in mind a reviewer had called it sophomoric (is fratermorphic a word?  Anyway it was both so I said goodbye and went off to watch something less juvenile. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show follows a pattern that is all too familiar:  Criminals are the most brilliant people in the universe.  The hero in this show has a chip implanted in his brain, yet the villains easily get away when he catches them, putting all of Earth in great peril.  The writers use the exact same premise in each show:  find bad guy, catch bad guy, bad guy has sly smile while he easily escapes to unleash his hell on all of us, catch bad guy in last 5 minutes of show and then have a tender moment between two of the regular cast members.  Ironically the one thing this show does not possess is intelligence. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was nothing but a full-on Beyonce infomercial. It really didn't reveal anything about her that we didn't already know. The best part of this "documentary" was the last 5 minutes or so. That's it. It's the same song and dance of many other celebrity docs--"Woe is me. Why was I given this life? My life is not perfect. Even though I'm a celebrity I have feelings like everyone else." Blah blah blah. This was nothing but smoke and mirrors, giving us nothing but the Beyonce that she wants the public to see, not what's actually there. I'm waiting to see a deeper Beyonce. But it does bring up the question: Is there a "deep" Beyonce? Probably not. If we scratch beneath that surface, there's probably nothing but more surface. Sad, really. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The writing is off and the fact that the main character is animated make the whole scene and all the acting weird, to be honest I consider the show a waste of time and descent actors. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could hardly wait for the series to start but it turned out to be a BIG disappointment. For one thing, they couldn't pick a worse actress than Ryan. Don't know exactly what else, but as soon as I flipped the channel, I channel, I forgot to come back to the show. Boring. Wish they release the original series on DVD already. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful series based on an awful series. Completely emotionless acting, vacant stares, bad special effects, a 12 second sequence covering a two-hit "fight" and the turning of fan favorite Katie Sackoff into a Dick Tracey bad guy all conspire to make this complete dreck. I'll watch it again only when I start getting paid for my television time or it turns out this mess cures cancer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Come on ONE bionic arm and only ONE leg, do we need a bake sale to complete the job. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Alias meets Heroes... except this show is terrible. A cool idea, but they managed to make it boring and utterly lifeless. I gave it a shot, wanted to like it, but it's a waste of time. And by the way, don't use a score with a saxophone during love scenes, it's very 80's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I grew up on the the original 6 Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman, and while they were not top-grade television, this new 2007 version is a sad disappointment. A constant stream of lousy atmospheric music, ramped up bass, and over-saturated colors cannot make up for the poor acting and scripting. This show takes itself way too seriously and needs to lighten up. The props department also needs to amp up their work - at least on my HDTV, many small prop items look like styrofoam or cheap plastic. In the most recent episode, graveyard stones, wall plaques and a laughable glass "war map" looked cheap and ridiculous. Tight and shaky camera work make all the fight sequences hard to follow. The producers attempt every cheap trick in the book but this this does not make up for the fact that, at least so far, this show is weak. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had such expectations...none were met...this is a reallllllllyyyyyyy bad show!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an incoherent mess. Lurching between two primary moods - murky and vague - there's far too little bionic thrills and far too much achingly-serious, self-important bluster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too predictable... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Cane" clearly lacks organization. This sort of drama seems to fall short on plotline and its premise won't take it very far. The pacing is all over the place and its storyline doesn't seem to have a base to support it, in which it makes the viewers wonder where this show is heading. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wildly boring. Twists are dull and seen coming from miles away. The premise offers no creative possibilities for the future. And Jeff Godblum will never be the amazing and daring actor he was in The Fly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Have only watched this once. Won't watch any more. Too slow, and Goldblum's character isn't very believable. Anytime the story needs to advance he gets a vision, how convienient and predictable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a show based on one joke. We get it...they're nerds. "The Class", which this show replaced, was much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a great idea I thought at first. Finally a comedy with smart people... but it is ruined by the annoying blond, repeated jokes and cliches. The best thing about this sitcom is the opening song. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Big Bang Theory is one of the worst shows that I ever seen.I hoped that it might be funnier after a season but it became worse.It`s not funny at all... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could not get all the way through the first episode but read some positive reviews and thought I would try it again.  Could not get through that episode either.  I like Cho but I find Gillan's character too annoying to be entertaining.  The jokes are flat, the situations are even flatter.  Sorry.  No more of this show for me.  I think it is appalling how bad this season's sitcoms have been so far.  Marry Me is the only one that I am likely to continue watching although Blackish isn't terrible but I certainly would not miss it if it was cancelled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The actors are great, the writing is horrible, the show has the cheapest jokes ever, characters are cliche of the worst kind.
What a waste of great actors and viewers time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I believe that this show could make a few minor adjustments, and be more watched. I feel that most of it is staged though. It is definitely entertaining when they meet each other, but leading up to that seems a little too far fetched for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe I'd like this show if I'd never seen or read any science fiction before and I got off on the idea of a hot, programmable woman, but for me this was just a waste of good talent and an hour of my life. Watch it right after an hour of BSG (as I did) and you'll really see notice this one's shortcomings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An unfortunate misstep by Joss Whedon. Too populated by glib beautiful people to be believable as a human experience (even a pretend-world human experience), too poorly written and trite to be interesting. Superficial but not tasty enough to be mind candy, guilty but not a pleasure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful.  Watched the first episode and this series has NOTHING to do with with the original Scream movies.  Coupled with bad acting, bad characters, poor storylines, and only small glimpses of actual horror.  It makes me sad to see that this is the kind of thing that thing that passes for entertainment these days.  So glad that I was born in the 80s and grew up in the 90s.

Giving this series a 2 based off of the fact it COULD get better.  It has a glimpse of potential. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible show i like comic books and superheroes but this is basically a replica of Pawn Stars which i love but theres no hope for this show. for me but for Comic Book ppl theres hope for you guys 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Kevin Smith, I love comics, and I love GOOD TV shows. Unfortunately this just isn't one.Kevin Smith's stuff has achieved popularity (particularly the podcast) imo because of an easy-going natural vibe, where things seem to flow freely. It's relaxing and casual, and loads of fun. This takes that idea, and tries to put ten layers of polish, scripting and spin on it. I just can't handle the juxtaposition... If I want to watch 'fake reality TV', there's others out there (with identical editing) that, I hate to say it, have way more interesting stuff happening. And without 'podcast' segments awkwardly shoehorned in.I suppose if you can bring yourself to believe that the customers and going-ons are unscripted/ non-acted (as most positive reviews here seem to think), it could be a little more entertaining, but that bubble burst about 20 seconds in for me. I wish I could like this more, sorry Kevin :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slcik but totally empty. I was very put off by the hyperbolic glitz. All surface not substance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Im not sure why I even gave this show a "2". The acting is so over done and the script so lame a human could not have written it. I forced myself to watch the first show but last night I only lasted 15 minutes. I feel sorry for anyone who liked this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's as cheesy as CSI Miami for the unreal stories and flashy gadgets, but at least they got Horatio Kane to make it funny and entertaining... Justice has no soul... Thank God Scrubs plays at the same time!! Zach Braff is a genius! Jerry should learn a few things from him in the lost art of TV entertainment! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot review the entire season, simply because I could barely get through the first episode. I found the episode boring, bland and cliche. The relationship between Carrie and her ex was really embarrassing and annoying; they should of made her "ex" just and old friend.  The idea for this series would be interesting if they directed and wrote the script with more in depth thinking. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cliche. Bad imitation of Miami Vice. The acting is horrible. The storyline has been done a million times. Nothing fresh or exciting. Certainly no Sopranos but a poor imitation.....like the fashion, interior design, nightclubs and everything else it copies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The movie was very good. Not surprised that a series followed. But for a show about Limitless mind. The extremely limited quality on the writing by the what seems to be not  too bright people makes the show a big turn off. It started alright , but the typical, lets make the good guys as smart as rocks could prevailed.  The main character is suppose to be infinitely smart but turns out that he does something bummer than a 4 year old. It is obvious as the writers (which are huge in supporting all types of drug use) are not bright enough to come up with anything clever. Too many times the "problems" have easy enough solutions that  99% of the viewers (even when they are stoned). Example, when the protagonist decides to hide extra pills he hides it in one of the dumbest places. Wow, even people in a coma would thought of some place better.  Except putting them in a bottle labeled PILLS, It was one of the dumbest places to hide anything. Does the pills average out the IQ when you are not in it?
I tried watching this show but I can not temporarily kill or disable enough brain cells with alcohol to make this show watchable.  Great premise, very good twist making him an FBI agent but unfortunately they will need to add actual smart people to the writing staff (or at least someone that is not extremely dumb).

This show has one good thing. Know how to accurately rate my friends, family and other acquaintances smarts. The more they like the show the dumber they are.  I give it a 2 which means I am a little dumb also.  have I gave it a 0 then I would likely be a genius. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why only 2? Because this show has NICE SFX, AND NOTHING MORE. The acting is bad, the STORY is NOT GOOD. I felt that the budget was short and that they couldn't show more of the main town.
LIGHT SPOILER  A guy gets murdered in front of a police station where a few scenes just got shot. Couldn't they film that elsewhere? It really seemed short.
THIS IS LAZY, confusing and badly executed. The alien design is weak, the makeup is as horrible as the costumes. Nothing is worth your time. I hope I saved someone's money & time.
= I dis-recommend this TV show. It's awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I remember this show!  But when did the aliens grow hair?  They used to be bald, with spotted scalps, and didn't this used to be called Alien Nation?  And what's with the post-apocalyptic Western lawman cowboys and shamans culture clash meets bratty adopted struggling to assimilate teenager theme?  Can we mix and mangle a few more cliches in there?  I'm sure the writers missed at least one or two.  Okay, Defiance is honestly not terrible, but it's honestly not terribly good, either.  Better than Revolution but nothing memorable.  This is probably because in spite of a colorful splatter of gore and an amusing scene involving the safe word calamari (don't ask), Defiance is about as edgy as a plastic spoon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched four episodes and I really tried to like it.  The premise of multiple alien species living with humans sounded like it could be solid, provided it was done right.  It wasn't.  The writing is sloppy and inconsistent.  Also it's riddled with cliches (girl loves boy daddy disapproves of, daddy threatens to kill boy... bleh).  With a few exceptions, the acting is bad.  It is simply a show with cliche plot lines and sub-par acting.  It's a shame, because the backstory of the aliens coming to earth did intrigue me.  Outside of the second half of the first episode, I have been vastly underwhelmed.  Also, the alien designs aren't anything special, but I could overlook that if the story was actually anything of substance.  Wouldn't recommend the show to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMG, please see the acclaimed UK versions if you want quality TV. The US version is poorly acted, horribly cast, and basically just a rip-off of Season 1 of the British series of the same name. Some of those poor kids can't act their way out of a paper bag, and the chemistry between the characters is non-existent. Another example of ruining a good UK show.  And the UK version has some great music, proving that MTV is clueless about good new music.  Thank God they never made AbFab into a US version. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for this show with the promotion and the success of Modern Family.  I was badly disappointed. The characters were uninteresting but trying very hard and with no success to be funny.  The show had no central sense of "place" and the relationships of the characters hard to figure out. None of the characters were likable.  The pilot was muddled with far too many subplots going on all at once.  I was at the same time confused and did not care to try to figure it out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The King's son is stupid, cowardly, drunk, treachorous, and GAY!! Did you have to make him gay? We gay people have to put with enough shit without reinforcing stereotypes. The Gay guy should have been the hero, now THAT is daring TV 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absurdity of an old-fashioned sitcom without the laughs. Totally implausible plots and dialogue that don't payoff as a normal procedural or as a comedy. Probably would have worked better in the quirky arena if Fox had let them keep the Saffron Burrows character instead of a generic pretty brunette and a teenage blonde that doesn't fit into the story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh boy, I get to be the first to comment on this show! Well, I was happy to see Christopher Lloyd'd name on the credits, but not Steven Levitan's. He was the creator of "Just Shoot Me," one of the more mean-spirited of the office sitcoms of the 90s, and now he seems determined to top himself in this department. This show's idea of humor is for the leading anchor lady to call her new co-star a "preening gasbag" in the last second before he goes on the air for the first time at her station in ten years. Well, he seems to deserve it, but still, how many half-hours of that could you take? I can't see this show outlasting "Anchorwoman." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The premise of this show is just plain boring. Its not absolutely terrible nor is it any good of a comedy at all but this is a forgettable show. There is no line that is memorable and really grabs me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel like Roger S. Frasier was such a classic, hilarious, and entertaining show. Kelsey Grammer was incredible, but it was his supporting cast, like in all great comedies, that made the show so wonderful, funny and warm. The bond between Niles, Frasier and their father, Daphne and Roz like parts of the family.... funny without being cloying. The supporting cast on BTY is horrible! NONE of them are the least bit funny, endearing or talented. That Latina gas is a one joke nothing, the young guys who wants to be an anchorman is BORING, never cared for Fred Willard's buffoonish style and the news manager is just a fat, frustrated, loud characature. I had high hopes for this series when I first heard about it. My husband and I watched the first three episodes and yesterday, we turned it off in the middle of the third. What a tragedy especially with all the talent that went into coming up with this show. Are the writers in mourning??? It's NOT funny . Get help before it's too late, and get rid of some of those ridiculous supporting characers. You need some heart on this show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this show is a waste of time. Grammer saves it from being a zero. We can now see that Patricia Heaton is nothing without Ray Romano and that cast from "Raymond". I think that most of the shows humor is written for 10 year old boys. I gave it 3 episodes, that was 2 too many ! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I only watched the pilot. Chuck and Kelly were fighting too much. It was stressful to watch. Heaton's character was very annoying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Red Band Society is waaay too manipulating. The show tries really hard to bring tears to your eyes, but I never got any tears because I felt it was trying to cleverly 'twist' and direct me into crying. Also, how can these kids be sick enough to be hospitalized yet run around the hospital like healthy vibrant teens?? None of them appear sick at all. RBS contains too much sappy, teen, emotional exploitation for primetime TV... seems like a small notch above a Disney Channel show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've watched both episodes, and I tried to like it, and did not succeed. The problem I found was that it's too quiet, there's not enough going on to keep you interested. Another issue was the characters- they aren't characterized well. They have surfaces - character archetypes - but I failed to find any depth. Amy Poehler is out of her element here, she's supposed to be tough, not wishy washy. If only her enthusiastic optimism was gung-ho fervor instead, then her character would be interesting. One excuse I have heard for high ratings is that it's going to get better- but this is a review of the show right now. Any show could fluctuate at any time. Potential and promise are insufficient reasons for a high score, only a mediocre score. I did not see any potential other than if the characters were rewritten. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really enjoy 30 Rock and The Office (US), but this show is just not funny. I really can't get into it after several attempts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

brilliantly this was the worst season of true blood today without any doubt, all you imagine what happened this season was terribly terrible from villains to protagonists (after finishing the season I'm just praying everyday for sookie stackhouse die). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Liotta gay??? Gimme a break!  Started out with great potential, super star power, but is steadily sliding into a script with no credibility and no redeeming value. Too bad. Not worth sticking with. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The shows first episode was really good and has gone backwards each week after.
Not worthy of a hour of my life anymore...
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it 4 episodes, and found it very difficult to get through all of them.  Here's why:
1.  J-Lo does a passable job as the lead actress.  For a show that is character-driven and features her in every other scene, passable isn't good enough.  She sure is nice to look at, though, and they deliver copious amounts of tight pants shots, reminding us why we love her.  But the writing is so bad that she must tell pointless lies, so she has to tell more lies to get out of them.  Like when she tells Liotta that her daughter got in a car accident to get out of a later meeting with him, when she could have just as easily told him that her daughter had a super-important recital later.  But no, the truth would have been too easy there.
2.  The writing is some of the worst I've encountered on any show, ever.  I know that sounds hyperbolic, but there are too many idiotic turns to name, such as:
3.  The FBI agent (Stahl) who seems determined to get her killed; calling at all times of the day and arranging meetings too close to the precinct like he doesn't understand how using an informant works.  He shows up at her house and adds an unnecessarily creepy vibe to what would be a routine operation if he just dialed it back.  Instead, he's hanging out in plain sight of Ray Liotta's character and not even attempting to be discreet about an operation that hinges on discretion.  Writers manufacturing drama by making characters do stupid things.
4.  The FBI agent's boss (the black lady, forget her name because she's irrelevant), who imposes 24-hour deadlines every 24 hours, as if she's determined to ruin the case.  Sending feds to an informant's house without telling her handler about it.  Sure, that's how the feds work.  The writer's are using these arbitrary deadlines as a means to increase drama, when, again, law enforcement 101 tells us you can't build an informant-based case in a single day, or two, or even weeks.
5.  The girl from Supranos who moves a body and covers up a murder so she can sell her house.  Seriously? This is after she sexted her husband's alleged lover, met up with her, and had the best sex ever, even though the lover had no idea it was a woman the very next day. Seriously?  She is obsessed over her husband's potential cheating, so her solution is to cheat on him?  Dumb.
6.  The rookie, who has to remind us literally every time he's on screen that he's not OK with shooting an unarmed man in the first episode.  I get it, but let the guy talk about something else for a scene so he seems like a real person and not a vessel of guilt.  Also, why wouldn't they just say the guy had a shiny controller in his hand that looks like a gun and he was playing a game with loud gunshots?  Is IA that unreasonable that they wouldn't say it was clean after finding a loaded weapon and heroin right next to the guy? Again, the truth would have saved everybody a headache.
7.  I don't know the name of the generic urban black cop who the producers felt we needed to say things like "My man is hittin' it! Give me the details, playa!" but everything he says sounds like a caricature of a person rather than an actual person.  Nobody who makes detective talks like a failed rap artist who refers to himself as "King Pantydropper".  Kill him off, please.

That said, Ray Liotta is pretty good and J-Lo sure is attractive, hence the 2 points. The rest of it is pure, color-by-numbers cop drama, and you're better of re-watching The Shield. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly this would be a good show if it wasn't a SATC prequel the show has absolutely no relation to SATC and it's sad they say it is. For ex: In this show her mother died and she lives with her father yet in SATC Carrie says the reason she has such trouble with men is because her father left her and her mother when she was 3, so I mean it's really annoying they call this a prequel when really it's a totally different show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show gives me a headache. They demand much too much, and take so much from their contestants. To them, they wager 100,000 of their MILLIONS, why for each of the individual contestants, this is their LIFE. Not to say their ideas are good or bad, just stating an observation. And always, I see these individuals not as entrepreneurs but as hustlers.I think the true entrepreneur has a sense of adventure, the want, no the NEED to take risks, whether it be for money, a cause, or what have you. All these "sharks" see are dollar signs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Had potential but moves so slow that you stop caring what happens. They whine, cheat, lie and the sex is as stilted and uncomfortable as their emotional lives. The lack of joy and resolution of any of this marital turmoil will make this show fail. To the one couple: have sex already! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Only good part is the nudity...i mean the topics are so dumb, overblown. Guy whines when his wife wants to have sex with him because he wants to be looked at as more than a "sperm machine"??? Come on!!!!! Uggg this along with John from Cincinati is a huge blackeye for HBO. DOn't get me wrong i love HBO and give every show a chance...but this is bad. Showtime is kicking HBO around in terms of shows these days...Brotherhood, californication and even weeds are the best shows on the movie channels now...HBO PULL IT TOGETHER!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Across the board, all of these characters are insufferable bores, and I couldn't care less what happens to them in couples therapy. Not even the prosthetic genitals will make me tune in for the second episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's depressing but also too contrived. Having to have the token lesbian sex scene thrown in there, was just the end for me. I guess I don't understand why these people can't communicate better! Is that the point? It's sort of boring and slow. I'm really trying to like it but by the end of the show, I'm annoyed by the whole thing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, this bears a lot of similarity to a higher quality power ranger spoof, you have the cheesy storyline, bland humour, over the top action, wooden acting, awful visual effects and clunky dialogue 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Super cheesy dialogue.  Maybe this will get better moving forward but the lack of one hero to root for is potentially problematic.  Time travel is a tricky story line to pull off successfully.  Dr Who does it mostly successfully.  I'll give this one of 2 more episodes to see if it improves. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not like at all the new Spartacus actor.First of all he's way to small to resemble a gladiator, then his face lacks the character of the protagonist or at least his acting is way too plain in my opinion.I was so eager to follow my favorite TV series once more, but I was really disapponted.Forced myself to watch more than the first episode, but after seeing the third, I will surely drop this series.I liked Gods of the Arena much more than this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show just isn't that good. The main character, Mike is just a generic hero boy who always gets the girl and "saves" the day. He is the main character and he is the most boring, because writers are afraid that watchers will not be able to relate to him if he has even the slightest quirk personality. That is where you are wrong writers. Main characters who have depth and an unconventional way of doing or looking at things usually attract more viewers.It's just an annoying over-used formula that has gotten annoying over the years. He doesn't really have a character or a true personality. He is just there as the pillar of morality that everyone on the show should follow but don't. Why does everyone on the show have to be extremely attractive? the hot blonde girl, the blonde hero, even the anti-hero Briggs. They just put a bunch of attractive people near the beach and said, "Hey these people are attractive, awesome cops, so you should watch this show" No.just.no. If you wanna watch a really great cop drama that is really dark, watch Luther. Arguably the best cop show ever. People will not find this review helpful, because they already like the show, but hey, the truth hurts. Rant over 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good actors, but characters and plot uninteresting. Work place too dark and undefined. Not entertaining. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Doesn't resemble original at all. Too many main characters. Just another mundane cop show. Goofy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was horribly boring, predictable, and lifeless. A waste of an hour of my life. I was having a difficult time staying awake. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad copy of "Mission: Impossible" or "Charlie's Angels". No depth. Hack written. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Grotesquely bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love classic police series but this one gah, so incredibly boring, the character is so fake and no where. What the role of another character beside the main two lead and Lidia, the script is so lazily done and the plot is so predictable. I can't imagine how this show garnered a lot of viewers in US. For me, it just plain boring and flat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dull story lines acted out as wooden as can be.  None of the characters are interesting.  I couldn't pay attention as there was nothing to pay attention to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I LOVE Robin Williams, that is, “Wacky/Loony Tunes/Improvisational Comic Extraordinaire” Robin Williams.  The SHOW “The Crazy Ones” does NOT provide the appropriate stage for Robin to SHINE—the way that our King of Clowns can shine.  Watched the first show:  2 minute of Vintage Robin; 18 minutes of something else.  There was simply too much “drama” (as opposed to “comedy”).   Because of Robin, I expected something similar to “I Love Lucy” “The Carol Burnett Show” “3rd Rock from the Sun”, “Seinfeld” or, to name a current show, “The Big Bang theory.”  In sum: I expected Filet Mignon—I got served baloney.  Oh, the SECOND show?  I watched 3 minutes, then switched channels.  I just didn’t have the guts to face another big disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The pilot episode featuring McD as the client left me cold. Williams is Williams. He's annoying. Though some find him funny. I don't. David E. Kelley can't decide whether "The Crazy Ones" is a comedy or sappy drama. Like Robin Williams, there's a feeling of mania and depression. The bottom line is there are few laughs to be found. Geller is a wet blanket. Supposedly the agency creative director, she comes off nebbish, frail and always too conservative. Of course, her dad, Simon (Williams) saves the day. He's a genius. That's what we're lead to believe. Unlike "Mad Men," "Crazy" takes itself to earnestly. There's no sarcasm. No funny look into the inner workings, the "back stage" view "30 Rock" or "The Office" did so well. The writing was much better with those shows. With "Crazy," the jokes fall flat. This is less a comedy, and a show about relationships between the characters. Wolk is fine, but Linklater is genuinely funny...at least subtle. Geller seems uncomfortable. As a person has worked in big Chicago ad agencies, this show has little resemblance to an actual agency. Though one of the co-creators came from one. This is a fantasy world. A platform for Williams' tired roller coaster ride of humor, if it is indeed humorous. I just saw the second episode. While a bit better than the pilot, Geller still seemed like a deer in the headlights. Oh, and Wolk and Linklater seem to be the only creative team working...with huge, big name clients. Amazing stamina. Workhorses. Like episode 1, 2 closed with a sappy feel good ending. Uh huh, just like real advertising. I just want the show to be funny. It just isn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a 2 because I'm watching even though -
this is one terribly conceived drama.
The holes are bigger than any other show I've seen in years.
i.e. Hank still lives across the street.
The family is mad at him?  Seriously.  They fixed evidence and they're mad at him?
The creator and writers seem to lazy to close the holes and every other plot point
is predictable.  And the characters have little dimension.
Now the reporter who's doing both kids (because the universe they all live in is
withing 2 miles) -- she's found the mother.
I'm just hanging in till Fargo comes back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Insipid. The situations seem forced and none of the jokes just happen. You can see all the jokes being set up and when the punchline finally comes, it doesn't seem worth all the effort. I'm really surprised this is on HBO. Although, given how bad season 2 of Girls was, I probably shouldn't be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Old stuff, hashed over with a minimum of original humor.   Likable characters, but I've seen it all before.    I'll probably try one more episode, but my expectations are extremely low. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very hard to like a show when the main character is such a **** and sooo unlikable! He becomes more human in the last 2 episodes, but I certainly won't bother with the next season. So many better series' on telly now, than to waste time on this garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Cooke family was by far the most chilling self-serving family with the worst work ethic on the ranch. I really didn't like this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Come on... these people couldn't get their act together if you lite a fire under their ass. There were a few of the cow hands that seemed to really try and some that even knew exactly what they were doing. But of course, all that got screwed up by the Cooke's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show started off pretty well with the unsolved cold case murder of Eugenie. It starts to get pretty bad when they keep repeating scenes 2 or three times. That's because these Yokel Cops are so incompetent and  don't do very much of anything. I doubt if these guys EVER arrested and got convictions of ANYBODY. I'm midway into season two and there is 3 cold case murders. They know who the murderer is,but they sure don't know anything about real police work and arresting the suspects.The only thing that seems real is Rhodie's guilt in not being able to solve the murders, and his getting drunk every night and feeling sorry for his sorry ass.. If they just fired everybody and hired some REAL police officers they just might get some justice. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

WARNING MATH AND RANTING AHEAD:    I think that it's a fairly good show but the fact that it isn't realistic is what angers me.  The Circuit board that was tested hundreds of times on earth, fails just before reentry and they also didn't have a backup system for one of the most important systems on the spacecraft!  Also the configuration of the seats would of killed some of the astronauts from negative G forces as they were put in a ring around the center which the ones on the side facing the heat shield would of been pulled out of there seats and slammed even harder than the guy stupid enough to go and attempt fixing a PCB during reentry. Another note is that when they land they said that they are 72 Km from the base and the Russian base which on the map didn't appear to be much closer than the Main base.  And seemed to travel at a ridicules rate to get to the Daedalus  with only three days of oxygen remaining.  That is the next point. They sent a ship to Mars with a 3 day oxygen margin!  And also your telling me that they couldn't continue to scrub the CO2 in order to get Oxygen? That doesn't make sense at all and the fact that during the early stages of reentry one of them said that they should abort.  What do you mean ABORT!  You didn't have enough fuel to break into orbit because you barely had enough to land a ship with that was going 1,000 KM/H and you wouldn't have had nearly enough fuel to get on a return to Earth especially when the planets are out of alignment for a return.  So there was no way to abort. End of story.  There ship is a piece crap and the rover which would be 2,000 Kilograms overweight is also crap.  2,000 kilograms is 4,400 pounds or 2.1 tons a six person crew would weigh together around 1,200 pounds if we go off an estimate of 200 lbs per person which probably isn't the correct weight for any of them and then maybe 400 lbs of gear that they brought down in duffel bags so that would be a total of 1600 lbs give or take a few hundred.  So I don't see where they could of "OVERLOADED"  the Chassis of the Rover as I can see that they would need the rover for hauling heavy materials for base building.  So overall this is a horribly set up show that I could go on and on about how they did it wrong and I am amazed that they got Jim Lovell, Elon Musk and Andy Weir to interview for.  When I read Andy's book the Martian it was filled with facts and the movie was pretty much up to Par with the book which is not normal for a modern movie. So why can't they get anything right?! Someone answer me and correct me on this.  For god-sakes the 30 minute BEFORE MARS video was better than the actual TV Show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high expectations of this, given Ron Howard's previous efforts such as "Apollo 13" and "From the Earth to the Moon".  I was sadly disappointed.

Several major issues stand out:

1) The split present day interview/future drama format did not work.

2) The interviews were mostly lightweight, apart form Zubrin (who covered well trodden ground) and Jen Heldmann.  Most had ho real expertise about Mars.  The best were those with astronaut Scott Kelly and his charming daughter.  The nadir was Ann Druyan and her statement that human space exploration is the modern equivalent of human sacrifice.

3) The future drama was very poorly realised -uninteresting characters, flat story, unconvincing assumptions.

4) Mars, as realised by the special effects was completely uninteresting, nothing like the magnificence of the real Mars we have seen in images from orbiters and rovers.

5) Numerous scientific and technical errors.

6) The soundtrack.  Nick Cave? Really?

7) The ending was a most improbable Deus ex machina.

I was left with a feeling of "Why bother" with this program - and with Mars.  And I am a planetary scientist passionately committed to exploring Mars.

Were there any good points?  I liked the international crew.  But this was balanced by them being completely uninteresting and that the factual interviews were almost entirely US-centric.  Some aspects of the technology shown was good - the spacecraft was impressive, though improbable for many reasons.  The suits were good,although the helmets and life support systems were improbable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love a good docudrama but just found this to be slow and really not worth the effort.  The show is not really a documentary or a drama, just a mish mash of the two.  Disappointing as I was really keen to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok so this show was just awful... let me apologize first for all Torontonians who are foced to cringe at the constant shout outs made each time this show airs. Let me also apologize for the terrible casting job done by this show. I assure you not all actors here in the great white north are this terrible.

So I watched this with a group and needless to say we all felt the need to blast it. Yes the show is mostly garbage and complete festering dog doo. But there are a few tiny gems. Jeramy isn't casted badly and is a cool actor, clay can be decent when he isn't forced to stoop to the female leads **** acting abilities. Never read the books myself so I can't really judge how its following the series. Only that this is a pretty god awful show and needs to be revamped or something to not make me want to gouge my eyes out. Originally from a small town and no girl looks like that, has a house that geared up, or guys look that Nicklebacky.

Though watching a girl who is supposedly supposed to be on the run from a band of serial killers and kung fu master constantly wear heels is pretty funny and entertaining. I mean like seriously man? Whatever just fap to her later right? -_- 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

total failure

The series is a pure disappointment.
In episode 1, it's all about the love life. This is just too little for a successful series. In terms of story you have to improve a lot.
Disappointing across the board are the performances of the actors and the CGI. It is to see far better in the old series.
If the series at the level of the pilot episode it is sold quickly how to "werewolf" can say. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is so amateur and boring being human UK and USA trumps this piece of crap show, i saw the first episode and literally fell asleep watching it , though i kept watching out of curiosity and hope this show will start to pick up and get better  but unfortunately i don't think it will. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This isn't scary AT ALL. The only scary episode was the 1st one, but it was still very predictable. This whole "dad left us a secret message telling us to kill this ghost!" thing is so tiresome. It's so bland, predictable and lacking thrills. There is no character developement whatsoever. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Supernatural, a show that reminds you just how good Buffy the Vampire Slayer was and how this consistently fails to live up to the legacy it left. Not only are its various plot threads boring and predictable, but it has assembled two of the least likeable protagonists in a long time, bumbling their way from trope to trope without any self-awareness or humour. This is essentially a Twilight TV show that is worth watching only if enjoy the occasional good special effect. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wasn't what I expected, no real humor. She acts like its some sort of "I never had a date before" mixed with "I'm easy", doesn't follow common sense. If I want to see a bunch of people sitting around drinking and no humor, I can watch Cheers and turn the volume off. I give this less than one season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

taped the 2 hour premier. watched it and never taped again. really, really stupid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Incredible waste of Dule Hill's talent 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not a good show. I was very disappointed. I missed the first episodel, but it looks like I didn't miss much. Actually, the show made me long for King of Queens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horribly forced comedy with canneed laughter. Do something new, this show is bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could only stand about 5 minutes of the show. CBS should follow NBC's lead and attempt to air comedy that doesn't need to announce itself with canned laughing. Five minutes, and there were already too many witless comebacks to count on two hands. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Promising follow-on to Downton given the period, setting and production quality. The sets and costumes are sumptuous and the multiple story lines interesting, but we still tuned out after the first two episodes. Jeremy Piven ruined it: overacted, out-of-step, and a far too modern persona for ~1910's England.  Instead, suggest using an empty refrigerator box to stage your own period drama. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What on earth are 1940-1950s style hairdos doing in a series set in 1909? No self respecting woman would have had shoulder length hair even if it meant getting a wig or hairpiece.  Rather, it would have been very long hair piled up on the head.  What a load of ridiculous rubbish! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Smith will be cancelled in 3 to 4 weeks, just as Smith himself predicts in the first show. Is there anything in these characters to care about? I couldn't find one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you go into this expecting "Glee" meets "American Horror Story," which was clearly the selling point, you'll be disappointed. This isn't nearly as clever as all that. Though I'd wager those responsible for it think it's clever. Instead, you get a watered down offering that feels a lot like the TV version of "Scream" with bigger names and less charisma. That's a major problem. Watching the first two episodes was a chore. This is a big miss to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main problem with Scream Queens is that it tries to be a self referential horror comedy like Scream, or more accurately Scary Movie, but it lacks the knowledge of the genre. Where it tries to stand out by having the typical 'final girl' character not be the protagonist, it fails by instead following the queen bee type character who dies by the halfway point in a horror movie. This could have worked if they actually put some effort into humanising the character. Unfortunately she is the kind of character you root against.

Another area in which the show fails is its attempts at comedic stereotyping. It is clear that the creators intended to mock the stereotypes, at least I hope that is what they were trying to do, but instead seem to actively push them. The show's portrayals of minority groups are appalling to the point where the only comedy comes from if you believe the offensive stereotypes. One example is the deaf girl who thinks she can sing but can't. That is all her character is. She is there to be mocked by the audience because she is deaf and doesn't know she can't sing. In fact, her death even involves the rest of the girls hearing and being aware of the killer but her disability leaving her unaware of her incoming doom. The execution of the death is so uncomfortable as well, her obliviousness is pushed for comedy to the point where we are expected to laugh at her as if she is an idiot for having her disability. There are plenty of other unfunny stereotypes, such as the fat Hispanic maid whose life is portrayed as less important than a girl's chance of getting into a sorority (again, it seems like they were commenting on something here but the execution suggests we should agree with the rich white girl's view point) and the gay guy who lust after straight guys (unapologetically portrayed by the king of queerbaiting himself, Nick Jonas). The only noteworthy portrayal would be Keke Palmer playing a black student who isn't a stereotype of a black woman (although there is another character that plays that role).

One final criticism is the show's overall humour. This can be summed up in the first episode during Ariana Grande's character's death. This involves her coming face to face (or mask) with the costumed killer and proceeding to flirt with them through texting whilst they make it clear they are going to kill her. It gets even worse when she attempts to call for help by writing a Facebook status about her being murdered, getting stabbed through the skull before she can hit send and then moments later coming back to life to hit send and then die again. Once again, this can only be justified by thinking it is an attempt at social commentary on modern culture's digital communication but given the target audience it makes no sense to have done so and, as always, the execution is off.

To sum up, it is clear that this show is an attempt on subverting an already heavily subverted genre and it deserves recognition for trying. However, it fails tremendously with its lack of understanding of both horror and comedy, not forgetting that it is regularly just plain offensive (which is surprising given the creator's background of inclusive and positive portrayals of oppressed group's in the past). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I rated the pilot a couple of weeks back and now the third episode aired a few nights ago and i just want to point out that it was awful. this show is going nowhere! Stick to the original Once upon a time not it's cheap spin-off 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's important to note that if you have any involvement in the mediation community you're likely to get upset by this show.  Many of the stunts that Kate Reed (Sara Shahi) pulls are very questionable in their legality, and pretty much all of them are completely inappropriate for someone acting as a mediator.  I realize the same thing could be said about any number of other shows out there, but those shows typically thrive off of a likable character, compelling plot line, or by embracing their own unbelievable nature and going for the comedic approach.  Fairly Legal doesn't have any of these. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, and it's certainly not serious enough to draw you in.Perhaps if Shahi's character was more likable it would be one thing, but after about five minutes her personality began to grate on me.  She states multiple times how great a mediator she is, but when she actually gets down to it she looks like someone just explained the concept to her five minutes before. It's not all Shahi's fault though, the writing just falls flat and seems to go for contrived drama rather than anything believable.I understand that portraying a mediator who follows the rules all the time may not bring in the highest ratings, but Kate Reed's take on mediation is like watching a three year old try to bargain with her mother to stay up later. Splice that in with shots of Reed looking confused about why her far from impartial methods aren't working, and that pretty much sums up the legal portion of the show.I'm giving the show two points for at the very least advocating mediation over litigation, but it utterly fails in it's attempt to communicate the process.  There's nothing to learn from an educational standpoint. In the end it's just another show about a woman sleeping around with her ex and acting **** about a job that she's not even that good at anyways.  The fact that they bring up the word "mediation" every now and then is just used as a failed gimmick to try and separate this from all the other bad legal drama clones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously? Another show promoting unskeptical nonsense. Keep this trash away from your impressionable children. Both reincarnation and past lives lack any evidence to their existence. Grow up.

Near death experiences have been explainable for decades. There is no excuse for lazy writing obviously taking advantage of naive viewers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My wife and I were extremely disappointed.  Poorly written and overacted, with completely unbelievable characters, this is the worst HBO production I can remember.  It seems to intentionally insult the viewer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is unwatchable Sarah Jessica Parker has a very strange speech pattern and makes the show impossible to watch    No real story being told three episodes in and I hate it just as much as I did when I watch the first episode can't recommend when I won't even watch  it again myself 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The plot is illogical and unfolds with unnatural speed. They don't even try to play with X-files mythology. In the very first episode they dump everything they had. It's looks like scriptwriters were forced to ruin the spirit and mystery of 9 previous seasons.
The play of Duchovny and Anderson is also not really enjoyable. Both look like old sad wooden dolls with frozen lips who can't even talk normally.
I hope in future episodes they will do better than this. They are in a good spot to add value to the legendary series, rather than just capitalizing on people's nostalgia. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the episodes are plain bad, both main actors Anderson and Duchovny seems they are not even trying, I'm not sure if it's because they are old or the script is so bad that make everything look cheap and poorly crafted. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It hurts me to give a negative review to a show I've loved for years.  But this season was distasteful and wretchedly boring.  Couple good instances get muddied with overdrawn monologues that seemingly go forever with no real point.  And the ending... wow... well in my opinion it lacked everything that characterized this show for it's four past seasons.  So disappointing... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wrote that rapidly, I hope you appreciate nonetheless.

A FEW SPOILERS! Nothing big.

If you thought season 3 and 4 were disastrous, season 5 will make you want to commit seppuku.
Where to start is the real question... The plot perhaps, or the characters, or the general story ? I don't know. It feels to me nothing was executed correctly. And it probably wasn't planned correctly either by the looks of it.

Let's get this stuff done quickly. Destroying this monstruosity will not be a grave problem. We'll start with the orchestra of characters, and I do not say this lightly; there are way too many characters. Half of them female replicates of the male characters. By which I mean, if there's a male that plays both sides, you are bound to find a female that plays both sides. I don't remember their names even though I watched the 13 episodes today. They are terribly boring. I found myself carving things in the corner of my keyboard with a swiss knife for 3/4 of an episode.

Let's jump on the plot. Oh dear lord, what an epic failure. If you asked me to resume that trainwreck to you, I wouldn't know where to start. There also it looks as if they tried to fit 3 seasons into one. There is 4 presidential swearing-ins in this season just so you get an estimation of size of the crash.

There's at least a dozen sub-plots, for 13 episodes mind you, and 3-4 main plots. Plots that end nowhere. Conway, the Republican just disappears into thin air. The old journalist investigates Zoe Barnes to no avail. The audience already knowing what happened to Zoe and it renders this plot useless and not interesting to watch. And it's that for the entire season. There's no end. Frankly, I don't even know how long the 13 episode last in the story's timeline.. 4 months, 2 years. I have no clue.

One part that particularly irritated me was the irrealistic portrayal of international affairs. I am willing to accept the incredible armor plot around Francis becoming President so easily, but seriously, in the portrayal of international politics, there is no reason to write it with this level of retardation. Maybe they should've spared a dollar in costume and hired a geopolitician to reinforce the international politics aspect of things. Seriously, to me, it seems the writers filled their script with stuff they heard on CNN. By the way, real news people doing interviews with fake characters for TV is a growing, and worrying trend.

Next step: the cynicism. I won't waste a lot of lines on the portrayal of the "Russian president who isn't Vladimir Putin because he has a beard now." One more caricature and he would be eating caviar while sleeping with whores in a bath filled with vodka. Francis or Claire, or Putin with a beard don't do things because they believe in them - NO ! - they do things because it serves their sociopathic egos. Only american pessimism can create such flawed characters. There's no point in watching a show where everyone is Machiavelli. All they want is the big chair and they're willing to do anything to get the big chair, so what happens ? They all do the same things.

Gynocracy. Do I need to say more ? It's her turn, now, boys! Let Claire be the sociopathic President, it's only fair ! One thing came constantly to mind: "Go back to the Kitchen." How Francis is capable of **** his way to the presidency and how he becomes a literal cuckold gay man once he's finally at the top is beyond me. They finally transfer at the end of season 5. Claire becomes the main character and frankly, I couldn't care less.
Breaking Bad with Skyler making the meth. That's how it feels now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

La razón de ser de esta serie era ver al gran Kevin Spacey hablando a cámara y haciendo de todo para lograr más poder mientras nos contaba como se regodeaba en su crapulencia y lo listo que era.

Primero se cargaron los monólogos a cámara casi por completo durante varias temporadas.
Luego se perdieron en narrativas absurdas sin peso. Luego incluso le restaron importancia al protagonista de la serie y pretendieron hacer un dueto (no me interesa Claire con su eterna cara de víbora malfo...) Hacia el final de esta temporada han dado otro bandazo absurdo y da la impresión de que no tienen ni idea de cómo seguir. Me temo un desenlace estúpido a más no poder.
Mi puntuación va por traicionar los propios pilares de la serie. Me parece de muy mal gusto. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The worst season so far, full of loophole and unnecessary plot. Time jump just make audience more confusing about the story. A lot of scene wont have enough time to explain what Fran's plant is about. And for god sake enough with feminist already it just make the show more stupid 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

People who watch ‘Low Winter Sun’ fall into one of two categories: those who enjoy the show because they like Mark Strong, and those who like Mark Strong but don’t enjoy the show. It starts well. The first episode opens in a dark room lit with candles (I have no idea why), an exotic leitmotif (which works despite its incongruity) and a close up of a weeping Frank Agnew staring at the camera. It’s a powerful scene that provokes instant sympathy for the protagonist, and justifies what he’s about to do. Unfortunately, in the episodes that follow, LWS conscientiously unravels both the sympathy and the heady atmosphere it set up in the first two minutes.

This show is giving viewers what it THINKS they want (a white middle-class antihero with no hair and some personal problems, a glimpse at a criminal underworld, stuff about drugs) without truly understanding what it was that made shows like Breaking Bad so appealing. LWS is too dark, too joyless, and MUCH too sordid. There is an excess of drugs, alcohol, prostitutes and (bizarrely) toilets. People talk about toilets, they use toilets, they shove people’s heads INTO toilets AFTER they have used them and the prostitutes FILM themselves using toilets. The whole fictional Detroit scene LWS sets up is so dark, so dirty, that it left me wondering why any of these people would stay in those jobs in that city. We were promised a theme of redemption, but I haven’t been able to find it.

The story is both overwrought and underdeveloped, with an awkward surplus of Serious Acting to compensate for the deficiencies of the plot. I wasn’t interested at all in the B-story with Damon and Maya, David Costabile is wasted here, and while I could happily watch Athena Karkanis reading from the phonebook, even she can’t lend the story some much needed beauty and moral relief from the relentless thematic and visual darkness of the show. I’d love to see Mark Strong in a sympathetic leading role. This isn’t it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe I made more than halfway through this season. I finally had to stop due to the convoluted plots, dull characters,  clichés, horrible acting, and repetitive orgy scenes w/ Lady Gaga. They were more annoying than shocking. I swear...if I have to see Lady Gaga's ass one more time! The series is nothing without Jessica Lange and if she doesn't return to the show neither will I. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing bore of a show. Bad acting and uninspired writing. Evan Peters sounds like someone in high school drama doing a bad English accent. Without Jessica Lange, this show is a skeleton of its former self. Stupid vampire tired theme and Lady Gaga's acting can't carry this show the way Jessica Lange did. Gaga just poses and wears fancy outfits -- no emotional compelling acting ability. Almost laughable that they are throwing every single horror theme into the script without any believability. The lead actors look very similar to one another, as noted in other reviews. Pretty boys with Ken Doll looks with equally plastic lack of acting ability -- perfectly coiffed and blow-dried hair styles. Sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How anybody can like this season is beyond me. It's not scary, it relies heavily on sex and partial nudity, the acting is horrible, the story is boring, and Lady Gaga is not that good of an actress. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

only reason i gave it anything but zero is because of moon bloodgood. cancel this show already. i'd rather watch reruns of supernanny than this overplayed crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe only one or two jokes that are worth a chuckle per episode. Really crude, poorly animated and a completely unlikeable main cast. The only decent characters are the zombie roomate and Merlin. Avoid this one like the plague. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It seems like lately all new programming decisions by Comedy Central are being made by emotionally retarded film school interns. Ugly Americans is no exception. The concept is idiotic and worse, the writing is dull and not in the least bit funny. This program continues the trend of awful new programming in the same category of such previous disasters as "Secret Girlfriend." This show is a dud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the animation reminds me of old-school MTV animation from the early 1990's. But unfortunately the shows all flash no substance. The jokes are conventional and recycled the characters redundant and uninspired and thats a pity given how great the show looks. Don't know why the critics are swooning for it, the love is all in its animation style not the content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really excited about this show. Really let down. The jokes are hacky. Sometimes I think that cartoons get the benefit of the doubt when it comes to absurdity. I think that when Family Guy gets into doing too many cut away scenes, they're really just doing the same thing those terrible "____Movie" films do, but nobody calls them on it because it's a cartoon. I think that the Men in Black movies did a better job satirizing the freaks that live in New York City, but it's a Will Smith movie, and it's a bastardization of a classic science fiction story, so you're not supposed to like it. This looks like "Super Jail" so you're going into it thinking that it's going to be as good as "Super Jail" but it's just a bunch of bad puns and cut aways. It's not a good show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great looking show but thats it. I know Stern one of the show writers worked on the Simpsons but jeez he'sgone way down hill. the writing is extremey cliche and unoriginal as are the characters. It'll air about 4 episodes and then it'll fade into obscurity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

James Woods is a great actor but I found the frenetic dialogue exhausting and unconvincing. Danielle Panabaker as his daughter is excellent, but found the rest of the supporting cast quite boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have enjoyed some of Lucas and Walliams work, but this was utter nasty spiteful comedy of sorts. One or two laughs but generally pathetic, funny if you're a small boy and still think penis and gay jokes are funny but otherwise not worth wasting the time on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Matt Lucas and David Walliams have taken the most commercial route into comedy they possibly could have. Matt Lucas' days of Reeves and Mortimer hilarity have been diluted into fifteen or so catchphrases repeated ad infinitum. Whilst the lowest common denominator will lap it up and bark "Want that one" in the middle of the street with their mates, the one's amongst us who aren't taking Lithium will watch one episode, take in the midly amusing anecdotes and then skip the next few years of talking dolls, "I'm a lady" rucksacks and singing birthday cards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The trailers contained the funniest parts of this show. The rest is just uninspired and predictable comedy. It's so forced, I can almost feel the actors cringe at each other (minus Dennis Leary). This has the entertainment value of 1 1/2 minutes of "World's Dumbest ________" (take your pick) spread out into 30 minutes. A better option would be to go to youtube, search funny, close your eyes and random click anything for 30 minutes. If you would like a small part of your life to be killed softly give it a go, you have been warned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show's  concept is great but became unbearably painful to watch after Ep5.  Now, I really cannot care less about these well trained military sailors who behave like a bunch of high school teenagers during the worst virus outbreak in the history.  Every episode, the captain puts himself in unnecessary danger without valuing his important as the leader of the ship.  So much of the show is simply unrealistic to a point it is ludicrous...  How the hell could the Russian choppers reach the far away arctic?  If the Russians wanted the cure, why the hell were they shooting the only doctors who could save the world?  Oh, and some of the dialogues are so bad, i feel sorry for the actors. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ugh...where to begin. The first episode was passable but barely. The science behind it is truly atrocious and makes absolutely no sense. At least try to have some reasonable science back story, not involving finding a primordial virus. Followed by a ridiculous attempt to design a vaccine for it  that somehow that makes everything OK. Also, there actually is very little to do in the plot of the last two shows with anything about the plague or the final solution for it. The last show was about the ship breaking down. In the end, what can you expect from something Michael Bay puts forth. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Everything with this first episode is bad, bad acting, bad story. Lead female role is train wreck. Rhona go home and learn how to act. Not gonna write anything else because this show will "die" soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You should watch this show only if you are brain dead!
The story is for 10-12 years old public. At the same time, it is full of sex scenes, violence, end gore.
The characters are so unconvincing, and the dialog so dull, that it will be hard to keep your gag reflex in check.
Pros: beautiful girls.
Cons: everything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I read the first book in this series and watched the show, of which I've completed 11/13 episodes. This show is greatly flawed.  They burn through 1/3 of an already fast paced book in the first episode (by skipping what was actually fun about that portion of the book), and fill up the remainder of the season with new material, which was shallow and spoils the realism of the series. They made it much less believable and I don't feel they built the magical world well, with just snippets of class noise in the background to try and explain how complicated and difficult magic is in this universe. They ruin every surprise there is in the book because, rather than have it remain a surprise, they insert it into the series so we can watch it happen step by step, which just makes it so much more boring. They explained "traveling" so very poorly as well.

Above all, though, I just hate how they represented Alice. The actress looks nothing like her. She doesn't act much like her either, and I felt like her acting was forced in a lot of scenes. She seems like a weak character when I felt she was very strong in the books. It changed the entire dynamic of the story and has me eye-rolling at every scene she's in (which is most).

Overall, these issues make me feel the entire story line is poorly put together and shallow. Not a series you can really fall in love with. Just one to tolerate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave this show a try when it first stared but I only stayed with it for a few episodes.  They try to hard to be dramatic when the drama just isn't there.  The things the parents deal with aren't that big of a deal.  It's every day stuff, no big deal  at all but if you watched the show with the sound turned down you would think somebody was dieing every episode.  Sorry but this show is a swing and a miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for this show. Bonnie Bedelia is the only unique and intriguing character. Lauren Graham provides a bit of comic relief. It seems to me this show would appeal to an audience that is subconsciously looking for comfort in the choices they have made as a parent. The Adam and Kristine Braverman characters are wound a bit too tight and their children would probably benefit if they relaxed a bit. Luckily, there are a couple of the supporting actors that definitely lend a hand in its favor. Maybe I'll watch this in twenty years if I have a family and all that jazz. Until then, I rate this average bull **** American television show a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Never read the book so went into this with no expectations aside from hoping for an entertaining 6 hours. Thankfully with FF on a DVR I did not waste 6 hours - even an hour was too much. Slow, confusing, weak acting, over acting, etc. Really disappointed - only finished it to see what happened. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show should be called I am too stupid to be alive....but I am really lucky. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would love to see great show making like this go into actual survival training! The whiney Kayakers should have picked up a set of marine flares from Wally world or at least some road flares,both are very common and could of ended Mr. "I cant Belive he left me's" drama when he saw the RESCUE boats. also no whistle? no Flashlight? on LPU.wow these shows keep RESCUE personnel volunteering and risking. There's more to a open water paddle than a "DEW' and a IPOD.when packin for your "ultra light go fast wanderfest "in the big outside,consider the weight of a fully loaded Bird(HELO) or Boat and all of the people you will put in harms way. all of the crews driving to site .the folks that fuel the Birds, boats, trucks.people,dogs,horses well you get the picture. great movie making! good tec-info.Soup sandwich whiney people.The Amazon jungle show with the SF survival instructor who was great! as far as the featured "SURVIVORS" they should not go out of the house! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to enjoy this new show, as I'm familiar with the streets it shoots on. I hope it improves soon or it is doomed. However, I felt the same about Seinfeld, which I grew to love. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bradley Whitford doing a straight rip-off of Dabney Coleman's "Buffalo Bill" recast as a cop. Might be funny if you hadn't seen every punchline done so many times before, it wasn't utterly predictable or the cop team wasn't already to the "uncomfortable old shoe" stage. Who had the dim-witted idea to put on a comedy where the straight character repeatedly cues the audience to be bored by the 'madcap' character's antics & stories? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just watched the first episode with a few friends and at around the 30 minute mark we were openly mocking the show's terrible acting and writing. If Netflix keeps putting out mediocre shows like this one the "Netflix Original" brand will mean nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good concept. Poor development/writing. Slow/Boring storytelling. Several plot holes. Lame ending.
Just not worth wasting time on it. Stay away and save yourself 6+ hours 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Critic indie darlings, Zal Batmanglij and Brit  will get some great reviews just for their pedigree, but the show is just an embarrassing spiritual sci-fi, political correct oriented, full of mainstream solutions, far from an indie thing. I binged trying to find something and was worthless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of those shows that tries too hard to be funny, and - when it actually has the potential *to* be funny, it squanders it with unwitty writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought the pilot was a bad joke, it was so bad. I think is one of the worst 2016 pilots. The aliens are stupid even if they could control everyone in their sleep. The only intelligent humans are the main female character and the black guy, the genius with no job doing absolutely nothing all day. The politics rapresentation is stereothypical, the series has a lot of bad taste, full of boring scenes. No laughs. If the shows were a real trash show it would be very good, instead it sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was one of the most boring pilot episodes ever! Nothing caught my attention. I didn't feel anything. Characters are just blank. It's wtf.  I'm deeply disappointed.

Somewhere in a dusty liquor store along a high road between anywhere and nowhere(probably Mexico) two Texas rangers, the shopkeeper and about a dozen bottles of booze get downed in a shootout. The perpetrators are two young men who take their dress code cues from those criminals in Reservoir Dogs, the movie by Tarantino.

Robert Rodriguez is at the helm of the pilot  as its producer which means we get the same level of violence we know Tarantino for, but none of the great dialog, brilliant situations and stellar cast. Rodriguez has gotten himself a cult following after making a movie about vampires that bears the same name as this series and this has convinced someone that money should be sunk into this series. It has otherwise barely anything to do with the movie, except that it has the same title, has the two psychopaths in suits on the run bearing the same name and women of the young nubile kind that are actually monsters. Monsters mind you, not vampires.

The pilot might have taken five minutes to show the gunfight and thus ended there and then which is a little too short to be acceptable.Therefore someone has decided upon having lengthy flashbacks interrupting and garble the flow of the tale. This includes one for a character that gets offed in the pilot and thus is a waste of time.. But even that is not enough to stretch out the running time, so the people who get shot do not die, but instead linger on so that they can exchange spoken text and even get up to shoot at the two suits again.
But even that is not enough therefore we get several monologues and weird conversations that aspire to be Tarantino like but aren't.
Next to that the women that are taken hostage are bound and have their mouth taped, yet they are not some scenes later. So what is it? They even get to kick one of the suits who is lying on the ground repeatedly while his buddy just gawks at them. This despite the fact that a few minutes previous they were contemplating killing everyone as to leave no witnesses, but they decided to kill everyone but not the two girls. But apparently the girls can just kick their asses without so much as being slapped or threatened by the disturbed criminals. They just walk out as if nothing has happened. I guess it all gets explained eventually

The whole wouldn't have mattered if there had just be someone to cheer on. But even the cop that survives being shot several times and is bend on justice of the revenge kind, doesn't endear. And certainly not the two serial killers and the monstrous women, however pretty they all look.

A pilot is supposed to give you a taste of  the series. So if you like series that bears the same name as the movie about vampires that does not play between dusk and dawn, has no vampires, has no compelling characters, has no engaging dialog and lacks a coherent script then this is the one for you.  It might even be called: pretty Rodriguez like.

If you want a show full of stereotypes and predictable humor that isn't funny, then watch this show. Unfortunately, the premise had the potential to be funny. I know some people wouldn't watch it because there are gay characters, and nay-sayers will blame them when the show inevitably fails, but Modern Family sure seems to be doing all right. The difference is the writing. The New Normal is not groundbreaking in anyway. Even when they think showing people having sex within the first 5 minutes is edgy, it isn't because we see that constantly. Make something original. please. This is a DO NOT watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think the show tries too hard.  It looks like it is a let-me-educate-you-about-gay-issues disguised as a comedy. I think that Modern Family and Glee do that in a much better way. The acting and dialogues are terrible! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't say I was  excited to watch this show,but I thought I would see something more original. The ''jokes'' doesn't work and all the characters are too stereotyped even for a comedy.Ryan Murphy needs to find the inspiration he had when he created Nip/Tuck, that show  was truly remarkable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was a train wreck in progress, dull plot and characters that I have zero interest in. If the ideas are relevant in the US then it is not translating OS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Crude, cruel & crappy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dude, this show is off-its-Rocker. Obscenity pinch hits for imagination and strikes out for those who love baseball and HBO experimentation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just really dull.... the show manages to stay alive with decent guests, but Seth can't hold it up on his own.

I hope he makes some changes before NBC finds someone else, preferably someone funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If people want BSG, then watch that... I hated it. Its sad that Stargate is now a soap opera. The first 2 episodes looked promising and I told myself that they were just building characters... nope, I need to find a new show now. Maybe someone will turn the new Star Trek movie into a series. And please leave out the drama! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stargate is a franchise known for it's humor and traditional sci-fi plot lines, not character development or drama. And yes, after a total of 15 years of that kind of show, a change was needed (the later seasons of Atlantis showed us this). Unfortunately, Stargate Universe tried to be too different. The show feels much more like a soap opera set in space. The best episode yet was only on par with some of the worst SG-1 or Atlantis episodes. Like previous commenters, I watched this show hoping each week that it would get better; that it would stop focusing on the sex and the drama and actually have an episode with a real science-fiction plot. I've since given up. SGU continues to show a pattern of relationship drama and, well, sheer boringness. Perhaps this show will attract more mainstream viewers who aren't necessarily sci-fi fans, but I don't think even they'll be interested for that long. I'd be surprised if this show lasted longer than 2 seasons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stargate in name only. The winning formula is MIA, replaced by a premise that is both hackneyed and shallow. The show borrows from genres that have already been done better and offers nothing new. The allusions to Lost, BSG, and Voyager are all valid -- only Universe fails to duplicate any of the aspects that made those shows memorable and captivating. Gone is the compelling team dynamic of SG-1. Instead, we're treated to hollow drama delivered by mediocre actors. When the pivotal character tragedy of the pilot episode could have been avoided by duct taping a stick to an aerial observation drone introduced just minutes earlier, you know the writers haven't brought their A-game. Good sci-fi may be a little sparse right now, but do yourself a favor and skip this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surprisingly bad. Not a single character has made me want to learn more about him or her. The story so far is also not engaging. And I hated BSG, so the imitation isn't doing it any good at all with me. Carlyle can do great comedy, so I wish they had utilized that part of his talent, but foolishly, they made his character all grim with no oddities. Damn, what a waste. I miss Stargate Atlantis even more now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring. If it wasn't for Robert Carlisle I'd have gave up weeks ago. Bit confusing at times. This had so much potential but it's being ruined with too much personal life back fill; why keep returning to Earth? Need more action on planets they're visiting to keep fans interested. No real plot, bit of a rehash of other series, e.g. Space 1999, Battlestar Galactica. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My son and I watched Stargate SG 1 and Atlantis and loved the shows and the characters. SGU seems totally different...so far, 6 or 7 shows in and we don't like any of the characters. It's all talk, no action. It's more sexual which I think makes it more an adult show than a younger audience. It seem to highlight how to have interpersonal conflict...without resolving it. If it doesn't pick up soon, we're bailing on this and that'll be sad because we were anxiously awaiting its premier earlier this year. It's more like BSG not Stargate!! Are there any new stargates in production? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have given it enought of my time 10 episodes in and well i dont like it at all. The actors are doing the best job anyone could do but the hap-hazard story line lets the whole franchize down. I LOVED SG-1. I LOVED Stargate Atlantis. I had high hopes for SGU but it has failed all SG Fans in every way. i would normally watch an episode and be smiling with glee and wanting more and annoyed because i would have to wait a week for the next but with Stargate Universe i am ANNOYED and disheartened because there is no real scifi stargate journey P.S. PLEASE fire the writers 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

We loved Stargate Atlantis, Bring it back. Stargate Universe was terrible, poor plot, poor acting. What were they thinking. The dialogue is horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tries to be Lost meets Star Trek but fails miserably (Lost in Space anyone?). Mediocre acting (Carlyle excepted), cardboard characters, bad scripts and poor direction. Episodes 1 to 3 should have been wrapped into just two. Boring and longwinded but can be forgiven as scene setting for the show. Episode 4 actually quite good. Entertaining. Carlyle starts to flex his acting muscles and Eli's character is toned down a bit to make him more bearable. As the comic relief he is just annoying. Ship loses power and pops up in a star system supposedly so its passengers can head for nearby inhabitable planets but Oh No!..They're heading straight for a star! Hands up who realised immediately that it was the ships intention in order to refuel itself harnessing the stars power somehow..yup..nearly everyone. Will the writers acknowledge that its audience is reasonably intellligent and not spring this as the "surprise" conclusion to episode 5? Episode 5. Nope..they think we don't know. Oh dear. Perhaps an interesting side story will appear. Yes. A group can survive by heading for a planet on the shuttlecraft. Colonel young decides on a lottery system to choose. If you expect a group of humans to end their days alone on a planet you need a balance of men and women for obvious reasons. This could have been turned into an entertaining and comic vehicle for the actors and viewers (who gets the gal with big bazooms? etc), but no, as about 14 men and 3 women board the craft I knew within a year most of the men would have clubbed each other to death fighting over the women. When Dr. Rush realises what is really happening he explains the power loss is due to the ship diverting all its power to the shields in order for it to enter the star and reenergise itself. So how did the shuttle manage to leave the ship with its shields at full strength? Episode 6. Water is disappearing so the ship pops up at an icebound planet so the passengers can get more water. Colonel Young decides to head a 2 man team with second in command Scott in tow. Hang on!? In the last episode Young takes himself out of the lottery of survivors as he is crippled and weak and wouldnt survive the arduous nature of survival on a barren planet. This week he's going on a mission to carve up and transport chunks of ice to the ship. A task requiring great physical strength and endurance. Two of his strongest grunts would have sufficed for this one. One more of the shows inconsistencies in plot development. Bet next week he's back on his crutch , hobbling around the ship. Seems the writers threw in this one to as an excuse to put Lt. Johansen in charge and deal with the aliens discovered aboard the ship. Seems a swarming group of particle sized aliens are taking thousands of litres of water at a time. How? How do these tiny aliens take the water. Absorb it? they don't have the body mass! Why do they need it? Such small creatures with simple anatomies probably exist by photosynthesis, turning sunlight into energy. There was no water on the desert planet they originally came from so if they need water to survive wouldn't they have died out on that planet? How did Johansen get them into the barrel? They obligingly swarmed in and that was it? Also, with the ship reenergised they can simply dial Earth using the Stargate and go home. Hurray! No. The ship only got 40% power back. Why? And if the ship is partially sentient, constantly sensing the needs of its passengers and obliging by popping up wherever its needed, why doesnt it sense their need to return home, head for a star, get full power and let them use the stargate? All these inconsistencies and more make this show a real loser. It underestimates its audience on every level. Where is the science in this science fiction? The lazy writers need a science advisor desperately. Any 12 year old in any education system in the world will do... This should have been so good but is so bad! Enoughs enough for me. Can't see this getting any better. Time to jump ship I'm afraid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh my God. They turned one of the best SciFi franchises in a piece of crap like Battlestar Galactica. That hurts! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The biggest flaw of the show is it tries to take itself seriously using characters which don't have much depth by adding lots of useless melodrama. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I knew they were taking the show in a new direction, and by new direction, they meant everything that has already been done to death. Instead of coming off as edgy or even sci-fi in any manner of the word, they turn around and are actually quite generic on the base where the previous installments although safe, were very story driven and kept people coming back for more. With Universe so far, were left with the only thing in this sequel that actually resembles the show stargate, being the stargate itself. The cast are all young and their acting ability shows through with how green they can be. Your best bet if you want to enjoy this show, is to most likely forget that its stargate and throw all your hopes and dreams out the window, because its no longer story driven, its a soap opera drama now, going off the fights among the characters, and from what we have seen from the premier, .are all forced conflicts do to poor writing. Some things to consider if you have watched SG-1 and SGA... The new "geek" who happens to be a gamer who solved some impossible code that apparently the combine force of McKay, Daniel Jackson, and Samantha Carter couldn't figure out, this kid apparently figured out without much effort. Within 2 days, he had acquired more knowledge on the ancients than the combine knowledge of Daniel Jackson and Mckay and was able to control ship systems with relative ease. The military personnel were weak at best, being what appeared to be weekend warriors serving their 1 weekend a month. The show has no control, no real direction and was very sloppy for a premier that was meant to bring people in...The show will get 2 episodes more at best before being ditched completly if things dont "fix" themselves. No im not looking for a rehash of SG-1 or Atlantis, however, solid acting and a story are a requirement...This is wormhole extreme all over again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Teen drama in space. Very childish. Too much sex and voyerism. Not enough SCIENCE and FICTION. The producing are spitting on the old fans in favor of reality TV watching children. The show now panders to those who think with their hormones instead of with their minds. It won't make it til the end of the second season, unless it gets a major overhaul. I love stargate .. just not Stargate Universe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Univertse is terrible. The charachtes are two-dimensional at best and the whole show has the look and feel of a soap opera. And why for god's sake haven't they found the lights yet. every scene seems to be shot in twilight.......... it's very depressing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know what was worse, the jumping back and forth in time (rips away any suspense), the recycled actors (glad they were only on the one show), or the Dr Suess dialogue. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the hell! Battlestar Galactica/Lost/ kind of stargate show what happen? If this crap doesn't change just bring back atlantis. what a waste of stargate goodness. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simple and poor idea about how to kill the briliate franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I couldn't have been more disappointed. As stunned as I was by the egregiously bad acting and unremitting use of every Civil War cliché they could pack into the first episode, even more surprised am I that other reviewers think Mercy Street was any good. Costumes and photography are the only reason I didn't give this a 1. Question: Why did one sister have a southern belle accent and the other did not? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful dialogue, embarrassing acting, atrocious accents, nice costumes as they tried to out do "Gone with the Wind" - and, missed.  Missed episode 1 - thank goodness!  Watched 16 minutes of the second episode and cringed in my chair.  Looked over at my wife and she was frowning.  Turned off - for good.  Wrote PBS and told them that they had wasted their hard begged-for money.  I should have just wrote: Scooter261 - What you said! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is so badly over-acted, and the situations are so ridiculously oversimplified, with everyone except the military being the bad guy (a wife can't leave the base with her child? being brain-washed by the miltary version of the Stepford wives? Are you kidding me???), that only the least sophisticated will watch it (or, so many of them will, that it will become a megahit). The military must be stewing over this (if I were in the military, I sure as hell would be!). I'd be surprised if it lasts three episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having watched the third episode, I can now unequivocally say this show is offensively bad. My wife figured that out after the first episode. What can I say? I'm a bit slow, I guess. Bad acting + mediocre writing = a painful hour. I can say the show looks pretty, but pretty technical stuff is easy; writing and acting are the hard stuff that this show doesn't get right. See this year's The Shield for writing and acting done right. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The opening episode of season 1 should have been entitled 'Operation Cliché', such was the nature of the script. The show also seems to pitched to 12-15 year-old kids - there are no sub-plots, no complexities, just a bunch of guys 'lock-and-load'-ing and playing 'soldiers', while the equally 2-dimensional women play 'supportive housewife' at home. 24, it ain't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Surprisingly bad action/drama series from David Mamet, the mind behind such brilliant works as Glengarry Glenn Ross, The Verdict, and House of Games. The Unit is badly paced, poorly acted, jingoistic drivel. And, yet, the worst thing about it is that it is unbelievably boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poorly written, unlikable characters, all the dysfunction of life thrown into one family. And I don't know any clergy who live in houses like that! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is so over-the-top it made me wince multiple times. Gawd this is bad TV. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely agree with Tom Shales of the Washington Post. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

By the end of the second episode, we seemed to have one of every cliche in the book, bunches of overdubs where I guess 'controversial' things were changed, and in general a large mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disjointed and disappointing. I LOVED Joan of Arcadia. In that series viewers were given time to let characters develop. In this jerky first episode, they all sucked! And what's with the plastic smile on Jesus? I won't be tuning in again! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm really disappointed in your depiction of an Epicopal priest. I'm am not of that particular faith, but I'm sure they will be very upset as to what you made this out to be. He takes the Lords name in vain, he says G.D. and Da*ns his own wife. I don't think that's very funny. His sister curses at her husband's funeral. Jesus is shown as someone other than what the Bible shows him to be....kind, loving, and strong. Another mockery .....trying to make a comedy out of something Holy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not funny enough to be a comedy. Not interesting enough to be a drama. Acting is good. Stories are not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

gay son...check dope dealing daughter...check statutory rapist adopted son...check alcoholic mother...check embezzling brother in law...check you get the idea. I watched this show with the idea that anything that PO's the religious right is at least worth checking out. I couldn't even make it through the first hour of the premiere. It seemed like the writers sat down and listed every cliched social problem they could think of and put it into one of the characters. The possibilities are endless.... and pretty damned hard to watch. The people boycotting this should find something else to get worked up about and let this die it's natural death. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can't decide if it's a comedy or a drama, and doesn't succeed at either. Pretty bad. Bring back Joan of Arcadia, which handled these Big Questions with so much more humor and taste! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tom Shales said it best: Tries desperately to be as incessantly offensive as often as possible on every subject possible -- and fails even at that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Besides predictable cliches and a tone that's been done to death, I think it's totally irresponsible that a show would draw its plot from research that has been proved to be completely false. There is no scientific link between immunization and autism. Further, people who refuse to immunize their children because of this perceived link are doing their children and the world a grave disservice. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is way too predictable, especially with the actions of Gordon Ramsay, you can easily guess when is the commercial break coming. It also lacks surprises and excitement which I wanted in reality TV shows. A cooking show turned into a disaster........ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I stayed until the end; through all 10 mumbling, convoluted, glacier-paced, dark, Twin Peaks stealing, too convenient episodes. Can I get these 10-and-a-half hours of my life back? Sadly, no. This was an intentionally confusing piece of pulp fiction, but without the wink and a nod that says, "Hey, we're really just playin' around here." This was supposed to be serious drama. It wasn't. I almost gave it up after episode 8, the party piece where - in a 40-room mansion - Taylor Kitsch manages to end up outside the very room where the bad guys are discussing their dirty deeds. And the cop arrives just in time to hear the bad guys talk about exactly what's taking place, what the critical information is and who's involved. Puh-leeze, Did Pizzolatto realize in episode 8 that he had too much story yet to tell and only two episodes left in which to accomplish that feat? I was expecting so much more after the McConaughey/Harrelson tour de force....but noooooo!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So disappointing to see such an exciting franchise crippled in its second season. The characters are cliched (all with their own run-of-themill demons, including a gangster grappling with fertility issues), the dialogue stilted (with characters often announcing 'who they are' to the audience, just in case we missed it) and the story line overly complex. I simply did not care enough to try and decode the investigation. Except for Vaughn (who needs to practice his ominous/inner turmoil face at bit more), the actors do an admirable job of injecting at least some life into a cardboard script. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Halfway through the season, and I still don't care about any of it. The first season was slightly above mediocre, but this one is way below what I had hoped for. Every episode needs to give you a reason to keep watching, but these don't.

Laziness is the key word here. It's even set in L.A.!!!! Are the actors and director too lazy to even go somewhere else to shoot?

Acting, pacing, and plot are slow and lumbering. I find myself spending more time playing games on my phone than watching when it's on. I really wanted something interesting to watch so I can procrastinate a bit, but I think at this point I might prefer actually scrubbing the grout in my shower to procrastinate from watching this.

I blame the director—almost any script can be made interesting if you know how to tell a story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow,what a drop off from last season. Boring,poorly written,lack of chemistry between the actors .

No wonder nobody can get an erection in Season Two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Don't do anything out of hunger - not even eating." "He looks half anaconda, half great white." "By the strident dialogue, I'm going to guess you're drunk." "Not strident, apoplectic." "I'm feeling a little apoplectic myself." "Alright Semyon, you wanna squab?"

Every character has reproductive issues. Ray sterile. Paul gay. Ani noncommittal. Frank impotent. Jordan Semyon barren. Is there some kind of significance to this or is it just so we can make ordinary HBO scenes more "noir?"

Ray survives something that should have been impossible to survive. Remember when Rusty needed a lengthy hospital visit to recover from the season finale last year? This should have been about as bad, but no.

The characters seem to have no motivation whatsoever for being officers of law. Do they not understand that they're just pawns of the cliched mafia? How do they not understand this? Is this supposed to be a plot twist later or something?

The dialogue is truly horrible. Even with captions on so that I can manage to understand precisely what everyone is saying, it sounds like LiveJournal. There is no balance to it like in the first season. When Rusty went on his noir thing, Hart would tell him to stop being pretentious. Now when someone goes on a Noir thing with dark lighting and face closeups, we cut instantly to a police department office with entirely unemotional dialogue that means nothing, yet is far more important to the plot. When the viewer looks back, they're going to remember looking at Vince Vaughn's face while he gave a dialogue, not the significance of Colin Farrell's character in the investigation. Thus in addition to terrible dialogue, it is terribly edited as well, a double-whammy of tedium.

The music doesn't fit anymore because this is LA, i.e. the cradle of half of the American entertainment industry practically. At least the more successful noir examples like LA Confidential get this atmosphere right rather than affixing a weird alien soundtrack to a place that we should probably be familiar with in some tryhard-nihilist fashion.

So far, the season is pretty cringeworthy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 1 was known for its creative and convincing dialogue with moving performances. Season 2 is so bad it makes me wish True Detective was never created in the first place. The casting is downright terrible -- Ferrell is his predictably cliched 'detective with a moustache', while Vaughn ominously walks around screen trying to look serious as the viewer patiently waits for the punch line/Owen Wilson. Dialogue isn't nearly as interesting or deep, the characters aren't nearly as developed, and the entire story-line feels like it was thrown together at the last minute to meet some arbitrary deadline. There is literally nothing about this show that makes me want to continue watching it.

In short, Season 2 is such a flop that it makes Rachel McAdams appear less attractive by extension. Someone deserves to lose their job over this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Meandering character development of characters that feel fake and phony. Just take the darkness and grumbling from Season 1 and slap it onto season 2 - none of the magic or what made season 1 any good. None of the characters are even that interesting and that's why they doubled up and have given 4 of them now. Rachel McAdams likes rough sex - why is this info I needed when the audience first meets her? Vince Vaughn was eaten by rats as a kid. Lame. Day 2 he ran out of food day 3 the light bulb went out day 4 the rats came. Just bad exposition and lame character dev.. Really had high hopes for the show but now after watching episode 2 - I can tell that with 20% of the show now out - I don't know why anyone would want to continue with this really unnecessarily convoluted but not interesting storyline with characters that are all dark/depressing/cynical. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

From the very first scene in Series 2 I was disappointed, its not simply that Season 2 is different from S1, it just seems like the script is trying too hard, the Photography is sub par and has none of the subtle nuance of the original, worst of all it has no clear story arc per episode.

But back to the opening scene .. and why this series is annoying me rather than entertaining, we open on the scene where Colin Farrel is talking to his son ... now I know they haven't brought up the whole rape thing in the first scene, but the script is going to question CF as being his dad ... I don't mind that concept, but visually and conceptually it was as subtle as a brick to the face. Its like the director/casting agent thought ok we have a dark haired skinny CF and later we want the audience to question if he's the father, so ok we'll cast a Ginger haired fat kid, it leave no question marks, no is he or isn't he the father to play on. It was almost like watching a comedy sketch. Simply put, this season lacks any sense of mystery.

There are also TOO many storylines, it felt like a train wreck, your introduced to what felt like 20 characters in the first episode, it gave you no time to buy into any scene or character, you get a few lines and your jarred of to another character.

It also lacks any sense of atmosphere, Season 1 practically oozed Deep South America, Season 2 has alot of aerial shots of cars on highways, shots that frankly could be filmed anywhere, in fact it seemed 90% of the opening episodes felt like they were shot inside some generic soundstage ... it simply lacks any real sense of location.

Its cliched, muddled, lacks nuance, and has some terrible acting at times, it's as if everyone knows it should be great, knows the writier is capable of great things but no one wants or knows how to commit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing is the only word fit for this season. After a first season of deep philosophy, incredible acting, not one single line wasted, and a good storyline, this season bores the soul out of the audience. Especially Vince Vaughn's forced, lifeless acting is frightening. The stupid jokes (I didnt want to use offensive words but that is what they are) like "it is like sucking a robot's dick" are just too juvenile. The not-so-complicated-yet-over-decorated background stories of the characters are dull, not intriguing at all. There are too much to be criticed yet the season is not worth the effort or the time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

you always compare the 2nd part to the 1st one. in this case it's painful. no one can introduce more complex character than Rust, or redefine the crash of personalities. now... it's just blockbuster cliche, trying to be more deep than it should, touching relations between people in most common and unintrusive way. ending up really, really cringy. take away the horror of Chamber's imagination, disturbing combination of human judgement, redemption, replace rural, unexplored Louisiana with comfy LA and you get this... thing. six minute uncut, disturbing insight into human psyche with unspoken words, CGI that are not there to make it more interesting but actually having a meaning, and music that perfectly fits the atmosphere of the setting - i don't believe such thing will be ever possible in this season.
it feels forced, unnecessary. cheap

it might be interesting. but not as another part of True Detective. you cannot match perfection. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointment starts at the intro already and then there's just nothing that ever becomes remotely interesting. Rather than introducing some intriguing crime (barely comes up), we get to watch a full ensemble of people with more problems then your general population. If it's gonna revolve around these unbearable characters I'm not watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was a big fan of Season 1 of True Detective.  The end of Season 1 was like getting off a carnival thrill ride.  It was a bit of downer to learn that the Season 1 finale represented the end of the ride, and I had to adjust to the idea that Season 2 would tell a new story involving different characters.  Like many, I was skeptical about the new cast (Vince Vaughn and Colin Farrell), but I’ve known what was coming for quite some time, and I’ve had time to adjust (lower) my expectations.
What I wasn’t prepared for was the change in Directors.  Gone (unfortunately) is Cary Fukunaga, replaced by Justin Lin.  Lin tries to be highly stylized with lots of close ups of Colin Farrell’s face with the lighting just so.  It’s sort of reminiscent of Michael Mann and the movie Miami Vice, but without the color or sultry heat of the Miami night.  Overall the direction comes across style over substance.
The story line is also underwhelming.  Last season, the crime scene in opening episode hooked me like a big river catfish, and I couldn’t turn away.  The plot simmered slowly like an all-day Louisiana Gumbo, and the story behind the two main characters unfolded like a slow southern drawl.  I savored the way the show took its time letting me discover the characters, their histories and their deep flaws.  You might not understand them, but you could empathize with and root for them.
The opening episode of Season 2 fell flat.  It was like, “Episode 1: Everything you need to know about the characters and their flaws.  This year we have four main characters instead of two and we don’t have time to develop the back story of each character so, we’re just gonna throw all our cards down on the table and get on with the main story.”  Not surprisingly, the pace felt forced.  The episode also lacked drama.  Instead of dramatic tension, there was dramatic music, much too much dramatic music, telegraphing the coming of each new scene.  The music was a like a sitcom laugh track, trying to make me feel something that wasn’t there.
Rachel McAdam usually gets cast to play “nice girl” roles and it will be interesting to see how see does as a cop with anger issues and a dysfunctional sister and father.  Dysfunctional is putting it nicely.   Her sister is an on-line “entertainer” and her father, unable to cope with the world, has withdrawn to a life of teaching platitudes in an ashram.  The problem isn’t that the characters have messy lives.  The problem is that the characters are sendups.  It’s hard to identify with or feel any empathy toward any of them.  Here’s hoping S2,E1 is an aberration.

Some of the worst writing I have ever seen acted out on the small screen. The dialogue between the two principals is ludicrously corny. I  feel sorry for them. They deserve so much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i've been watching for 15 minutes and i still can't decide if this show is being ironic or not. i think i would think it even more awful if it were trying to be ironic because it's not even a little funny or entertaining. however if it was being purposefully bad at being ironic than that would be both funny and ironic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sherri is so desperate for a career, she is in that 'YES!' mode to absolutely anything people float past her. The horrible decision to take on this sitcom may cost her dearly. Any entity considering her for star roles will most certainly see this show and second-think their use of her. While she does as so many black comedians do, exaggerate the blackness for comedic inflection (a staple of sitcoms ever since the phrase "what choo talkin bout Willis?!" was uttered in the 80's) she shows little comedic timing beyond that 'character' voice she uses when trying (desperately) to be funny. Even when she is dancing around Hot Topics on The View, she turns to her inner-city tone and accent in order to deliver a cheap laugh when needed. Her normal persona is actually quite well-spoken and articulate, but she seems intent on suppressing that side of her. Trust me sistuh, there ain't no room in Hollywood for anothu silly sistuh! We gots those ever-where. Be yo self girl!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A ridiculous attempt at mainstream sitcoms; and that's saying a mouthful when you consider the quality of mainstream sitcoms, or lack thereof. Sherri Shepherd is painful to watch as she attempt to deliver sassy one-line 'zingers' in hopes of eliciting side-aching belly laughs from what the show's producers expect to be wide-eyed, adoring female viewers. It's a swing and a miss and sadly I can't even recommend a "check it out for yourself" suggestion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My girlfriend loves Season 8. But she also loves Grays Anatomy. This used to be an excellent show but now its drivel . Did the change the writers or something. I no longer watch it but my girlfriend cant get enough of its melodrama. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is comically bad.  It magically shows up on the PVR each year, and somehow I watch some of it.  Entourage is like an old dog that needs to be put down. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A lot like The Soprano's, this show should have ended about two years before it actually did. There was no need to make another season, especially since it has been so boring so far. Bobby Flay and The Dice man have been the two most interesting characters on this season, and I'm pretty sure most young people have no idea who either of them are. As always Adrian Grenier is the worst actor on the show, which just adds to irony since he's supposed to be an actor. Bad writing, bad acting, and a plot all over the place makes for a very bad season. Skip this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This concept has been done before, and much better too.  Let's put pretty people in scrubs and put ridiculous scenarios in front of them.  Being in the medical field, I find this insulting the intelligence of Americans. I just hope people don't think this crap mimics reality(except maybe the sleeping around). Pass, pass, pass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is the epitome of lazy and offensively stupid writing. Step 1: come up with something shocking to put on the screen: people gouging their own eyes out, dismembered cats, Rob Ford descending from the ceiling of a sorority house to kill a bunch of young women, whatever. Step 2: say "it's a cult." As long as there's a cult involved, people don't need to have personalities or motivations. They just do whatever the writers need them to do that week, brainwashed by the cult's message that... murder is art, or something. I mean, really, who wouldn't want to give up a career in the FBI or local law enforcement to just settle down and gouge out people's eyes because... well, no reason. It's a cult. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was this show originally meant to have "lone" hero, someone working alone to bring down the bad guy?...
This show makes law enforcement look unbelievably incompetent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely terrible excuse for a series. Uninteresting, predictable and tame (the only fear factor comes from the gore). All of the characters I found myself not caring about, leaving me indifferent when they lived or died. The antagonists are boring as well, and the jump scares are predictable as they come. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show exhales ridiculous amounts of **** There is literally nothing of merit in this show. Kevin Bacon is  average, the rest of the cast is rubbish, only James Purefoy is half-decent. The writing is non-existent. Natalie Zea is hot. Shame, because another network drama about a serial killer, Hannibal, aired at roughly the same time and is infinitely better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How this series made it through three seasons is beyond me. It was torture getting through the first season as it plodded along painfully, and I waited for it to gain some momentum. Actually, I thought it had potential in the beginning and was getting into it a bit. But it became so ridiculous and far-fetched that the most I got out of it was muscle strain from all the head-shaking and eye-rolling. The only reason I didn't give up was because I didn't know there were three seasons until I realized by episode 15 that there wasn't going to be a resolution. I would rather have my eyes cut out than to sit through another episode. What a disappointment! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Acting is decent, not great. Plotline is purely ridiculous and eventually had me screaming at the TV at the idiocy of the FBI and police as they blunder into convenient mistakes to help the sad little man at the center of it all lead his mindless followers on murder sprees. I made it to episode 8 of season one, when the mastermind escapes due to ridiculously contrived scenarios that had me guessing he escaped by the very second they mentioned he requested a transfer. Just too ridiculous, I couldn't keep watching. There is seemingly no reason for the mastermind's followers to be so devoted, given they have no overarching cause besides "follow what Joe says" and "kill random people because you can". Joe isn't charming or even clever, he's a pathetic creep that wants revenge for being caught after killing people and making it all about Poe. It's just bad, I just can't watch it and take it seriously. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really tailing off now after a good start.  Dream sequences are scraping the barrel, and a week before Easter, it's actually getting implausible to the point of meh, whatever... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Please!!! What is it with the FBI and the Keystone Cops who are constantly stumbling through stakeouts, getting killed by amateur criminals, and surrounding buildings like idiots? Its silly how inept they make the FBI out to be.    I really wanted to like this show, but the writing is beyond horrible.
Fire all the writers and start over or cancel this mess. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I 1st heard of this show, I was quite excited, I thought FOX might
come up with a new, innovated crime drama that pushes the edges of what
we have seen so far. Suffice to say this was far far far from that.

Right from the 1st episode you know this show is stupid. This
situations presented are so far fetched that they at times just make
you laugh rather than anything else. A serial killer who manages to
charm 100+ followers into organising themselves and carrying out
coordinated attacks......all while being locked up in jail. If that's
hard to swallow the police response to this will leave you gagging.

You would think that a nation wide band of crazy serial killers would
warrant some sort of elite task force or something of that sort, but
instead we have a small group of barely 5 people who seem to be
managing everything.....badly. They are assisted by Kevin Bacon's
character, your standard bad-ass do-gooder who is the center of
attention and has a bunch of 1-liners. Together they manage to
accomplish next to nothing.

As the story progresses the plot gets sketcher and sketcher, characters
start dying like flies. You would think that would add a sense of
realism to the show, but honestly it is just annoying. You find that a
character you liked and who's story you wanted to keep watching just
ends up getting murdered rather casually. By the end of the show most
of the characters are dead and you feel like you've just seen a crappy
slasher flick.

All that being said, the show is still entertaining, in the absolute
basic sense of that word, like how watching watching clowns shoot
plastic arrows at each other is entertaining.

To sum up, don't expect much from this show, however if you want to
kill some time, it'll do that for you.

(Season 1 review) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this show, but I can not. So many simple editing mistakes. I do visit our local jail and my friend is allowed 11 people on the list; and it's hard to get on that list. A person must prove that they knew the person being jailed before sentence started. My friend is not on death row where I can only think rules are even more strick. I do like the acting, but the script sucks/are humans really so hopeless  At least in criminal minds it raps up in a episode or 2... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One more thing...the cult guy who pretended to be gay then smothered his pretend gay partner to death with a pillow in a mercy killing thing all of a sudden became a hardcore killer...not only is he now a ruthless killer but he can outsmart the effing FBI in the dark woods AND get back to the mansion!!!  Lastly, thank the Heavens above that the FBI in this show is fake! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a clinical forensic shrink it baffles me that the complex motivations driving cult behaviour and psychopathy are not better developed. The penal/justice system and its representatives are completely misconstrued. The level of gore is disturbing! The script is terrible and plot ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The writing is poor, the story is unrealistic and uninteresting.  A decent cast and acting, however; the suspension of disbelief required makes The Following is completely unwatchable.  Hannibal and Bates Motel are far better in the thiller/horror genre.  I can't believe a show this poor was renewed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this show but finally gave up. It is simply an insult to my intelligence. How bad to the writers want to make the FBI look? (Not that they may not deserve it in reality...) At the end of the day why would I want to spend 98% of its showtime laughing at its faults in logic and sense. A good premise gone bad for lack of intelligent and realistic writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bacon works as hard as he can to save this show, but ultimately the writers are to blame. It moves from one clunky, contrived twist to the next, constantly insulting the viewers’ intelligence. Do they seriously expect us to believe that the FBI, especially post-911, would operate with such ineptitude?

And it seems that every episode was written with the aim of engineering a scene where one or two of the show’s good guys end up on their own in the dark, being stalked by some random knife-wielding maniac. You can probably glean a small amount of entertainment, as I have, from approaching the show as a comedy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoyed the first episode or two, then the implausibility of the plot and its characters became too much to handle.  It's funny that such a notorious serial killer was allowed an unlimited number of visitors, never had a conversation taped, and had absolute ability to connect with the outside world  not to mention the fact that he somehow has roped in hundreds of "followers" from inside a maximum security facility.  The 2nd huge beef I have is in the form of a question: What's the end-game of this series? Will we see a resolution of the Joe Carroll situation by the end of this season, or are the writers planning to continue to string us along with a new twist every week for the entire run of this series? My wife still enjoys watching, but I can barely watch the inanities pile up each week. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Kevin Bacon should be ashamed that he has attached his name to this product. I remember the days when I used to look forward to anything containing Kevin Bacon. I gave this show way too much of the benefit of the doubt and somehow managed to watch the first six episodes when I had spare time and literally nothing better to do. I had heard good things. I seriously have to question the taste of the people who told me such good things. It is boring, over-the-top unrealistic, predictable and legitimately gets annoying at some points. Episode 7 is out now but I will gladly say I won't be wasting any more time. I wish I could get that time of my life back and maybe gain an extra hour of sleep for each episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Serial Killer Babysitters". "Occasional Serial Killers, Babysitting". If neither of those is clear enough, how about "Negligent Borderline-Incompetent, Misses-Every-Shot, Wimp Seeks Small Boy". True, the pilot was action packed and depraved with quite a high level of violence for people like me (who enjoy shows like that). Also true, the show immediately degenerated into a program consisting of a failed FBI agent missing or misinterpreting nearly every clue while the writers dangle in front of our faces the correct answer so the FBI agent appears even more foolish when he doesn't get it, which is nearly always, and a little boy who is missing. Every episode is about a missing little boy. It is a show about a serial killer (who didn't actually kill very many of the people he is in prison for killing, which basically makes him a pansy who rode on the coat tails of a younger, blond, serial killer who did the heavy lifting, as it were, so he could become the famous ex-college-professor serial killer, 'cause that is so very likely to happen to a professor of gothic and romantic literature, for whatever whacked out reason he has in his literature professor mind) and it is also about his serial killer following (losers and weirdos) who, oddly, also don't kill very many people. Mostly, they babysit and talk about the little boy they are babysitting, hence my correction of the title to what it should have been, "Occasional Serial Killers, Babysitting". The lead FBI agent is as offensive to me (Criminologist, among other things, because, yes, I'm that smart) as any portrayal I can recall. None of the agents I have ever known were this incompetent. Yes, I've known some local cops who could not shoot very well but this "agent", played as wimpilly and milk-toast, by Kevin Bacon, as he would have been had he been played by a cardboard cut-out, of Kevin Bacon, (who is actually a brilliant actor when the script isn't so terrible). This agent misses nearly every shot, save those approximately two feet in front of him. He doesn't explain to the lady in this scenario (also a college professor) that she might not want to believe the criminal mastermind when she is told to go with his little buddy to see her son, nor does he explain to her that pretty much any agent would have done a better job finding her stupid little ruiner of everything (her kid), even, well, let's see, perhaps the ATF agent I knew who had the job of sitting at a desk doing almost nothing because he'd gotten so gosh darn old and just wouldn't retire. The FBI has an entire unit in this series hunting down a crew of horrible killers who have abducted a little boy and occasionally, again occasionally, kill a guy, maybe, if they have time and feel like it and aren't hungry or tired or busy babysitting said little boy. Meanwhile, in the real world, I could name five who killed over twenty people, two who killed over fifty, one who killed over one-hundred people before being caught or going dormant, and my degree is pushing fifteen years old. So, we are, as the audience, supposed to believe that this killer, probably one of the weakest and least prolific in the history of the world, is the worst of the worst, meriting the involvement of an entire unit of really poor detectives and a cripple, or whatever you call someone whose pacemaker makes him cry all the time. This is among the least interesting, least thought provoking serial killer storylines I've ever seen and is clearly written by a team with little to no background in such things. One thing is clear, these writers really love their children which is probably how they ended up having nothing else to say through this magnificent medium we call television. Don't watch it unless you want to be annoyed or are eating and not really paying attention. (I watch it as my Monday night fall-asleep show... and Tuesday... and Wednesday... and part of Thursday.) I give it a Two for exceptional production values. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing shatters believability, or ruins your ability to suspend logic and enjoy a show, worse than bad casting, and this show breaks new ground in that area. How in the world am I ever supposed to watch this 19-year old play the part of the guy in charge, of all things, and not have seeing him and hearing his yet-to-change voice rip me out of my suspended belief and cause me to realize I'm watching a crappy TV show? This kid gives orders to people three times his age. How could he have possibly become so experienced, and why on earth did they cast someone so young to play a senior detective? I have to fast forward through his scenes, because it's the equivalent of casting a woman to play a man, a child to play an elderly person. it's ludicrous, and I can't, for the life of me, imagine how anybody could view that move as being beneficial to the success of the show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I recorded this show based on the megacritic.com Critics Review. This is another one of those shows where I don't see what everyone is raving about.  The story was rushed and obvious.  It is a cheap knock off of House with a ghost and an extremely lame "new age" guru that reminds me of the one on Seinfeld that turned George purple.  However, I think they wanted you to take this healer seriously.I will not be watching Ep #2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't understand why the US re-made this series. The original book by Christos Tsiolkas is brilliant, as is the 2011 Australian TV series. While there is nothing particularly bad about the acting here, the characters are poorly drawn, and the direction is heavy-handed, leaving me as the audience little desire to invest in these characters or the remainder of the show. Additionally, a major underlying theme in the book and Australian TV series is a focus on race and class relations specific to Australian society. From viewing the first episode of the re-make, it feels that any adaptation of these themes appropriate to American society have been given short shrift for something that instead feels superficial and more like a soap opera than anything else. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First two episodes I thought I'd like it. Not so.  It disintegrated quickly.  I got bored with the hysteria around what appeared to be a terrible event that should have been settled in a therapists office.  The kid, the patents and the offender all needed more than a court case could ever settle.   The last episode was good until the very end.  It seemed like they just ran out of time and the judges ruling eas just plain silly and unlikely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Come on, seriously? I've watched three episodes of this and i don't even know how and why. Maybe the show can be good if you want to laugh at...at...just everything you see in the show. But if i want to laugh i'd just go with some comedies like louis c.k, parks and recreation, arrested development and so on. Usually i don't want to laugh watching something that is supposed to be a drama.

Also, i find that the da vinci's actor it was just bad and without an inch of charisma. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am disappointed with this show. I wrote a historical fiction about Lorenzo Medici so I know a lot about them. None of this show is historically correct. Lorenzo wasn't even the patron to Leonardo he was to Michael Angelo though. The actors seem too British to me and not at all Italian. Historically Lorenzo's brother, Giuliano, was murdered at 17. It is what I call fluff, sex and violence using a low budget. The Borgias have better actors and cosutmes while staying more true to historical fact. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All the girls are blonde.. It gets confusing. I was confused by the explanation of why the setting was different, and felt that they're trying too hard. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It just doesn't work. The new characters are both annoying and boring at the same time and the jokes are flat and predictable. I loved the first six seasons of this show, but then it took a serious downfall into emotional sappiness and season nine just hits rock bottom. Unfortunately. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I will list the problems from bugging me mist to least. And 1. J.D needs to be in it. 2. Carla, Janitor, and Ted needs to come back. 3. My main chick has got to go. 4. I don't like the whole school thing. And 5. It doesn't feel like it should be Scrubs anymore. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone who enjoyed seasons 1 through 6, this comes off as a complete disaster. Anyone remember "saved by the bell: the college years"? Braff takes annoying to a whole new level. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The main character is wholly unlikable and the devices used to ensure he stays forever in gambling debt are frustrating to no end.  His collectors are forever disappearing after one episode and every time Keegan gets some money, he loses it in preposterous manners which have nothing to do with his gambling addiction (for example, he puts off delivering a $15k fish for three days for no good reason, allowing it to rot or trying to impress his ex-wife at a private school's fundraiser or paying for a prostitute).  The only enjoyable part of this show are the cases, and even those are played more for humor than to exhibit any form of brilliance on Keegan's part.  This show is nothing like House, save for a string of ill-advised relationships. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utterly boring I'm afraid. The plot is disconnected and quite ridiculous and makes very little sense. The story is chock-full of the same cop characters we've seen in every other show only this time the writers decided to spice it up with robots. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Usually, it's the second or third season before the writers get lazy, kick back, grab a donut, and write some dumb ass hostage, kidnap, or bomb around the neck story.

Any hack can do that.

What a waste of a great premise, a pretty good ensamble cast, and decent direction..

Up to now, the demeaning of the "little guy", a 'la Saturday morning cartoons, was the only fault.

Coulda been a great hybrid of SF and cop show.

They missed their chance.

I'm gone

Quite possibly one of the worst shows on television today; period. Greek offers nothing new in the category of teen drama, and simply attempts to mask long-posed soap opera drama with alpha through omega (while failing to do so). The plot turns and predictable outcomes are the only drive towards progressing the storyline, which seems to be already circular and repetitive, even in the show's second season. Let us also realize the that the content of this show is not entirely appropriate for a family channel appearance. Sex, mainly, is the only theme that drives this forsaken work forward. Thus, considering that everyone on the show has almost already had a conflict in bed with everyone else, maybe we will be fortunate to experience Greek being Black-balled. -Gordan. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why are the same tired formulas keep getting used over and over again? Did we have enough with The O.C., One Tree Hill, Angel, Beverly Hills 90210,....? If you do not get it, it boils down to uncharacteristically beautiful people living the glamorous life solving unrealistic problems. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All this show is doing is playing on the stereotype that society has formed about Greek organizations. This stereotype is utterly distorted and this shows is only doing harm when greek organizations are trying to fix this image that America has of them. There are plenty of other ways the "Family" channel can portray college students having "fun and partying" in a non-greek atmosphere. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This barely shows any semblance of what Greek life is all about (not that its meant to be totally factual). That said, it only damages the Greek communities out there that are working hard to break stereotypes, to become true leaders, and to do good things for their communities. They also spelled Greek with two Sigmas, which just annoys the hell out of anyone wearing letters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Superficial relationships, underrage drinking and sexual undertones.Does America's youth really need any more exposure to this crap? Thank God for the V-chip and my remote control. ABCdysfunctionalFAMILY is more like it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mediocre effort by Andie MacDowell, who comes across as unemotional, stiff, and very mechanical in her portrayal of the lead character.  Would be like kissing one's sister as she seems to be just going  through the motions.

The lack of continuity of the characters, the plot and places within the movie make the viewer do a double take as to what they are really seeing   the books have sold in excess of 170 million copies for a reason, why the movie elects to shun the book is a puzzle.

B grade actors giving a D- performance in a low budget soap opera that would never hold it's own on daytime TV.

Hallmark aims for 95% female viewers and in the age range of 25-54,  no way the male population would be attracted to Andie MacDowell and so therefore it's low rating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Chelsea tries a little too hard in these episodes which seem to drag on, plotless and unmotivated. She often comes across as your entertaining middle-aged aunt ranting about something that really isn't original or creative. Yes, the self-absorbed and "I don't like other people just my pets" schtick is a staple for many comedians, but in this series you'll see her use that a walker. I would suggest she try harder, but it seems like these episodes were her doing exactly that. Thank God there were only four. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is for the birds. This show is more onesided than ever. I have not seen the black family(Mother and Father)interact with any whites to learn the white culture. The black father need to learn from his son that this new generation is more mixed that our generation in the 70's and 80's. After reading some of the reviews, I agree that the families were not carefully picked. The white family seem to never been around blacks and the black family came in with a chip on their shoulder about the racism. The producer should have picked families with some simular life styles. The teens to me had their heads on and was willing to learn. I have a stong belief that our child of today can cut the racism if the parent have an open and willing heart. This show only brought out the worst and at the end of it all the parents still had an issue. I pray that Bruno and his wife marriage do not break up over this mess. Their love for each other is more than the racism in this world. Yes I am a black female in her 40. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can honestly see both sides of the show. I'm white but I have some black friends. I can see that my friend and I can be treated differently but I don't know if it's just because we act weird, expect it, or not. Both black and white people need to see that they both treat each other differently. I think that it's in how you act on it is the point people cross everyday and don't let it run your lives. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know guys, seems like a really safe attempt at PG-rated horror. I was rooting for Terry O'Quinn as a "LOST" alum but his watered down and oblique references to H.e.l.l and what's really going on were just disappointing. This show should clearly be written for adults but it comes off as written for tweens so it's not long for this world. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seriously? They can't come up with anything new? I'm seriously pissed off that MTV is continuing making remakes of already perfect shows that are fine just the way they are. The jokes don't work without the British accents. There I said it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I grew up with this guys. ACTUALLY I became a producer because of "The Muppets take Manhattan Movie". I think it is the best Frank Oz film ever. They made me fall in love with the business. Their songs, the special guests... it was magical. This is Depressing. is disney behind this? They lost their soul, the divorce/break up thing is truly sad. Fuzzy looks like an old desperate comedian that failed hard.  We adults have enough options to watch on tv. Jim Henson will have never approved this version. His work was full of fantasy and happiness and the sarcasm was so subtle, so innocent. I know we all missed the Muppets, but somethings are better as an old good memory. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all, this show is blatant and insulting pandering to the midwest audience (everyone is fat in Peoria, right?).   Second, it is yet another ripoff of The Honeymooners. Ralph Cramden, the dumb but affable blue-collar average joe, has been played by Fred Flintstone,  Kevin James, Jim Belushi and others.

Apparently, the creators of this show think a clever twist is to have the wife not hot like the others (WIlma Flintstone, Audrey Meadows, Leah Remini, Courtney Thorne-Smith), but also fat.  Yeah, amazing idea.

The writing  kind of essential for a comedy  is just bad   But what I find most offensive is that promo  shot CBS keeps running with the lead character husband in an old-fashioned cop uniform (could this scream regular guy Ralph Cramden any louder   And. "Oh look and my big strong working guy hero husband!!" to pander to the women views).  Of course CBS tries to appeal to both women and men by having the husbands' point of view be crude (cliche) and the wife be sweet and smarter (because all husbands on tv are dumb and their wives are smart to appease the idiot viewers who would really like to believe this.  This is just like the reverse tv reality where men slobs beg for sex from their hot wives when in our real world all the women are fat and no husbands want to touch them.

Bad tv sitcoms- most of the shows out there now  can't be clever, so they just offer alternate reality pandering to the not-so-bright masses. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I signed up for an account just to have my say on this show.  I had to turn it off during the second episode because it was just so wrong and full of outright falsehoods.  I can't believe this is a History Channel production and it is really disturbing that the commercial authority on "history" would release this with so many errors and outright lies.  I am now worried that this is what people will actually begin to think is true.

I am giving the show a 2 because it was pleasant to watch (at first).  The WWI scenes were nicely depicted even though the tanks were wrong.  The image of a young MacArthur casually walking across the battle field is exactly how I envisioned it.  However, the gross negligent errors later will quickly put everything about this show in question, and the History Channel's credentials as well.

This is not nitpicking.  These are atrocious mistakes.  The Germans really had B-17 bombers in the 1939 blitzkrieg of Poland?  Did the Germans really have Soviet T-54s (a 1950/60's era tank) during the blitzkrieg of France in 1941?  This show actually says the Germans attacked straight through the Maginot line and won because of "blitzkrieg"!!!  No mention of bypassing static defenses and cutting off the BEF and mobile French forces that were NOT sitting in the impenetrable Maginot Line.  This show didn't even mention the British and French pact to go to war with Germany should Poland be attacked.  It made it look like Churchill pressured Chamberlain into declaring war after the fact!  MacArthur was not a 5 star General during the 1930's depression!  This isn't just nitpicking small details like "they got the wrong rifles", these are very substantial errors and my fear is people will think this is the truth!  Now that I've seen this I have to question the History Channel's authority to release or publish anything on history at all.  Their credibility is gone as far as I'm concerned.

Dear American Public, please enjoy this show for it's art and cgi war scenes only as it is beautiful, and they got Churchill down to a tee, but do not accept any of this show as real facts.  Indeed, if I were a teacher I'd assign this show for my class to discover each and every falsehood and outright lie, and for extra credit, for them to find any actual truth in the entire series.

How could this get past editors, or even the guy who gets everyone coffee?  How could this be published under the History Channel's name without anyone noticing these things?  I guess this explains why the channel's format is dominated by Pawn Stars, moonshine runners and alligator hunters.  Disgusting...

As someone who has spent all of his life learning about World War 2 I was incredibly dissatisfied with the lazily made pathetic excuse for a history program. Full of historical inaccuracies that are just plain insulting and far too America-centered. That is coming from someone who is a patriotic American who was angered by the fact our British, Russian, and Canadian comrades were left out so frequently during this program. Many key leaders were left out entirely which points to a very lazily made program.
It is now apparent the History Channel is dead. Ancient Aliens and now this. This program was a disservice to the brave men and women of that war and to the channel this was made on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All you need to know about this "documentary" is that spends more time on a little anecdote about Patton mounting a gun on a car to chase Mexicans than it does on the entirety of the Russian revolution. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found this series disappointing in that it reminded me more of the comedy series "Drunk History" than anything seriously academic.  One could easily extrapolate Sacha Baron Cohen as Stalin, John Hamm as young Patton and Jack Black as young Churchill in this glib retelling of WW2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm writing this review in the hopes that, if you have any inclination to watch it for similar reasons as I, you might be spared the misfortune of doing so. After the actual story was revealed and I wasn't just trying to piece together what exactly was happening, I finally realized that it was just another rendition of the same tired old mad scientist, possessed house, killer ghost, Antichrist, and eventually, I'll assume, all of the other yawn-inducing horror plots that I've come to loathe. And to think I'd expected, due mostly to the description, some sort of semi-philosophical consideration of evil. What are people's motivations when they commit unspeakable murders? What drives a rapist to rape? These were the questions I was hoping to have answered. "Satan told 'em to!" or "They're a man." or "They're going insane." is about the best you can hope for from this show. It's not an in-depth exploration of mankind's capacity for evil; it's a shallow rehashing of the same dismissive explanations that everyone resorts to when their brain has to work hard and they'd rather put an end to that because, gosh golly, it's just got so many other things to do! Or, at least, that's what it tells you so it doesn't have to second-guess itself or use logic, god forbid. There was only one character that I actually liked and I'm pretty sure I wasn't supposed to since he was a man. Did I mention that this show was written by feminists? The misandry is strong in this one. The writers did deprive me of enough information that I had to watch nine whole episodes to figure out what the show was going to be about. Tricking me into watching nine whole episodes of something I hate is a remarkable feat. For that, the acting, the costumes, and the possessed house itself (It's a pretty cool house. It's kind of a Victorian thing.), I give this show 2 out of 10 stars. Everyone did the best they could with what they had. Unfortunately, feces encased in gold is still feces. If you go any deeper than the epithelium of this show, you'll find that that's what lies beneath: boring, recycled feces. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is something on the lines of  horrible with no clear direction where it wants to go. With some good acting and cheesy, cliche scares it is the worst FX has ever picked up! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This TV series is bad, not scary and uninteresting. I'm wondering what's so good about this TV series. I realised that it was not as scary as the trailers described it. Overall, this TV series is horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you're unfamiliar with American Horror Story, allow me to explain the entire show to you. Each season is a new independent story with exclusive characters, but the same cast. There is always a different supernatural origin for the magical happenings. This relatively understated premise is the only coherent thing about the show, however.

The tone of the story varies widely from scene to scene, going from what is trying to be abject horror to flip teen comedy. The scariest parts aren't scary, the funniest parts aren't funny, and in fact, usually these feelings are switched with one another. Parts that are supposed to be horrific are often unintentionally hilarious like you're watching an improv show, and parts that are supposed to be comedic are cringeworthy, like a trip to a fan fiction website.

The brunt of the acting work is done by Taissa Farmiga, who is always the same angsty teenager, Evan Peters, who is always the same angsty teenager, and Jessica Lange, who looks like Bruce Jenner because they had the same plastic surgeries, all three of whom are of the caliber of a weekly patient on House, M.D. Other actors come and go - mostly has-beens with one-shot shows from the 1990s or 2000s. I believe in the cast, and trust that they could be award-winning given the right script - but they are not given the right script, and rarely have been, thus their presence on this show.

Politically, the show commonly has an LGBT agenda, reaching out to closeted types who don't have anyone in real life to share themselves with. This social justice objective is somewhat undermined by various ham-fisted attempts at being Stephen King: straw-man bigoted characters are presented, but the plots often unintentionally are bigoted themselves (for example Gabourey Sidibe's character in "Coven" loves fried chicken; Jamie Brewer's presence and ability on the show are in direct contrast to her constant portrayal as a weirdo played up for horrific effect). The result is a "layered" presentation of gender issues as in Glee: a somewhat unbelievable, hackneyed middle ground between acceptance and hypocrisy.

One aspect of note about the show is that the cinematography and direction, such as they are, are pretty good. The whole thing is well-shot and locations are rather attractive and memorable. Sadly, the writing is horribly embarrassing, to the point of comedy.

I vote that the series be renamed to, "American Horrible Story." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The cinematography is great.  Too slow,  too many suspects.  Flat characters. Forced American accent, not many likeable characters.  Its even hard to feel sorry for D.T. character 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am not connecting with any of the characters despite the shows obvious attempt to appeal to a diversified viewing audience.  John Stamos's character has a "Charlie Sheenesq" quality to it displaying a general lack of respect for women.   I will give it a couple more episodes to see if I can start to care if Stamos can be domesticated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do not think I can watch another episode of Stamos trying to behave.  I also do not think a character who occasionally declares herself a lesbian qualifies as a gay presence on the show,  They do attempt to have a diversified cast to support the main white actors.  The best things about Grandfathered is that it gives me time to go to the bathroom and fix something to eat before The Grinder starts. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh Please! The acting is poor and the plot so telegraphs itself that I wanted to turn it off inside the first 10-minute segment. This despite the heavy dose of spooky "whodunnit" presented in the overdose of commercials aired over the past few weeks. If the show is to continue even two more weeks along this track, please cancel it! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The cast is filled with talented veterans and good looking newbies, but unfortunately the acting, writing and directing is some of the worst I've seen in years. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shame on the makers of Dallas for endugling in the last "legitimate" form of discrimination - against those with mental health disorders.  The creators of the show paint a picture of Marta Del Sol as this unhinged, unstable vixen who stalks her ex-boyfriends, threatening them with violence.  Just after these revelations, they show a close-up of a perscription bottle that, of course, reads 'LITHIUM'.  So sure, everyone knows she suffers from Bi-Polar disorder, and "of course", that makes her some violent psychopath.  That would be like hearing that a character in a TV show has contracted HIV, and the makers of the show focus on hand-to-hand contact and pull some dramatic music out ouf their ass - like you can contract it that way.  News to the Dallas creators - there are millions of Americans who are bipolar - it's one of the most treatable illnesses, and the vast majority are just like anyone else.  And Marta Del Sol is taking her freain' medication!  So don't make her look like a psychopath by using that crutch.  Go ahead and do it by her actions - not by her condition.  Very poor.  Bad form. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 1's shockingly bad writing did not get fixed at all, though new showrunner Josh Safran improved the pacing. Kat McPhee is still the weakest link, and the show's emphasis on Karen as 'the most amazing talent ever' isn't evident in her performance, which makes a central element of the show ridiculous.  Megan Hilty is the breakout star of this show, a show that should have been great, and she's the only reason left to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh god gouge my eyes out please!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Started out good then got worse and worse. Too slow to tell the story. You keep waiting for something to happen and waiting and waiting after episode 4 I was done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just started on this, somehow missed it in the mountain of shows available. What can I say ? Compared to AMC's Breaking Bad and HBO's Deadwood, this is just godaweful. It looks okay - a tad cheap around the edges, but ok, but the dialog, acting and storyline are very bland.  Just like The Walking Dead before it, this seemed like a nice idea for a show, but evidently nobody who knows how to write a script or direct was available. If you haven't yet, don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ambitious, beautiful and well cast with an interesting premise filled with promise. That's it for the praise though. Pacing, dialogue, acting and character development leave much to be desired. So close to being great that it skipped straight over being mediocre and went right to crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've watched every episode of this show and can honestly say this show is hard to watch. I keep wanting to like this show but just can't. The jokes fall flat and you can almost predict what the joke is going to be about. Predictable, sophomoric and frequently unfunny. The cast is likeable enough but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This would be better for me if it were on stage, where the overacting and exaggerated lines would be more appropriate. The raucous laughter whenever there was a mildly amusing wry line, no matter how well delivered, was annoying, so I'd like to see the intrusive and inappropriate laugh track gone.
Love the actors and the premise of the show, but I won't watch again. Disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this show. A group of people who want to be "free" claim territory in the mountains & form a renaissance/tribal sort of society. I watched the first 7.5 episodes.. got halfway through the 8th episode when Foster announced "his choice" to marry a female already taken. This is a show where only the men are free. Females are used for domestic chores, sex, & procreation.  No logical female would give up their rights to live on this mountain lol. What a freaking joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another CW Sci-fi show with more teenage drama than actual science fiction. Set in the future: 100 young people are sent to repopulate an abandoned planet Earth. It has the potential to be interesting, however, once again, the CW assumes that young people will only watch a show if the majority of the characters are attractive high school-age teenagers (played by adults in their late 20s or early 30s), or if there are a few romantic couples that they can ship. The story has no substance and it's attempts to create a "Lord of the Flies vibe is almost laughable. And since the lead characters aren't particularly interesting or charismatic, then there really is nothing left to enjoy. This show should have been cancelled on arrival.  The two points are for Henry Ian Cusick. This show is a waste of his talent....he would have been better off staying on Scandal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I read the professional critics review on this site and thought I'd give a go. What a mistake. The visuals are well done but then its all down hill let down by pantomime level acting and script written for a specific target audience who probably won't watch it because it is 'sci-fi'. This show had promise with a good premise and could go in any number of directions but I for one won't bother seeing where it goes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Extremely predictable with an awful story line. It is filled with plot holes and extremely loose logic. For example, how do you break your leg with the bone popping out and begin walking again after 12 hours? No, that just does not happen. And the lust in this show is ridiculous. Lets just say if one of the teen girls meets another guy, they will 100% get it on and "love" each other on first sight. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I generously gave it a 2 because I was able to watch the entire pilot. Review by psoomah was right on target "..hitting up that all important hormone crazed scientifically illiterate teen demographic...."

1. Poison sumac is not a kind of moss growing pretty purple flowers. You don't even want to get anywhere close to it. And yes, the small white flower clusters in real poison sumac are poisonous to the touch, so if some cute guy sticks some in your ear, your ear will look and feel unsexy. Hey, if your gonna make something up, fine, but don't call it something that already exists.

2. Hmm, those wrist bands have some pretty kick ass transmission power to send bio stats to an orbiting station. Somehow all other transmission requires a centralized communication center.

3. Amazingly stupid doctors have to argue the blatantly obvious out loud. I'm not a doctor, but I think I would be able to perform a differential diagnosis to rule out death by radiation poisoning.

4. That vine they used to cross the river was totally lame. I could clearly see three ropes twisted together, thinly disguised by a little vegetation. High school play level quality.

I can't believe I'm actually watching the second episode.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a lover of hard sci-fi, I've tried to stay with this show, but in two episodes they have shown people dodging bullets! I don't know about you, but that insults my intelligence! I'm now convinced this series is made for clueless millennials. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What started as a promising series ended in an orgy of killing and destruction, so very typical of the American mindset. They just can't get away from who they have become. How deeply disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor acting, fast paced and obvious plots that occur so frequently in a single episode that it is impossible to form an opinion on any of the characters. It almost seems as though the director is making it up as it is filmed. The actors look as though they have strolled into the wrong set at the studio and should actually be filming a new high school musical. No grit, just polished American rubbish. This will not be successful amongst a British audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Is bad and already got renewed, i dont know if further gets any better but the first 3 episodes put me to sleep
1- bad acting
2-recycled story
3- they cancelled tomorrow people and not this?? come on!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The TV and Movies have just about a 100% hit rate in their failure to provide even the slightest taste of realism in any show that is centered around what writers believe is the "business world".  99% of investment bankers are not handsome, slick  philanderers.  They work 65 hours a week and are surprisingly conservative, amateur party animals at best.  Attorneys at top law firms are a similar breed, but add an extra 10 to 20 hours of work per week.  Management Consultants may very well be at the top of the "stuffed shirt' scale, and their profession may very well be the least interesting of the three, especially to watch.  This being said, Don Cheadle and his team of frat boy wannabes totally miss the mark.  This show fails at being satire because there isn't one grain of truth in their portrayal of the consulting business, or consultants. It fails at being a straight up comedy, because it's not even the slightest bit funny.  It succeeds only in being a cheap rip off of Showtime's other show about decadent lifestyles, Californication. In a nutshell, this show needs to be destroyed as soon as possible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the first season after hearing that Cheadle won a GGlobe. I don't get it. It's barely funny, cheaply vulgar, and if it is a satire or indictment of modern business culture the show is not good at it. There was  a canadian show about banking called Traders (?) on CBC that I remember being better at this. Oh well. I say avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not funny, not thrilling, not sexy, very hokey and very badly acted excepting Paquin. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring, lame. slow paced, terrible acting. PAris Hilton scary House of Wax was a masterpiece compared to this. we were 4 in a room and we all agreed, that it sucks... Very disappointing 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've seen 4 complete episodes only because people keep telling me this show is really interesting. after 4 episode I can honestly say there are about 5 minutes where it didn't suck. terrible dialog, acting, storyline, and uninteresting characters. they need a nuclear bomb to go of in that down and move Bill, the only with some potential, somewhere more interesting. this show is less interesting than john from cincinnati and that should say it all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite possibly the worst adaptation of book to show I've ever seen. The story line is not even close and major changes are made to the lore Harris created in the book. About the only similarities are the overarching thread of season one to book one (murders of fangbangers and vampire enthusiasts) but other than that the only things that are the same are the characters and the settings. Sookie is nothing as I imagined to her to be (and the acting is terrible) except for blond. The only accurate casting was possible Eric and Pam but acting still leaves something to be desired as does the special effects. C'mon people! Buffy didn't have great quality graphics but yet they were more believable than this show's. I am truly disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show seemed like it might be good, but it just seems to have gone down hill with each episode. The writers apparently have no idea how to deal with problematic characters other than just killing them. It follows Jason for much of the show simply having hallucinogenic dreams and sex and being far too stupid to live. There was no foreshadowing as to who the murderer might be, even though the main character can read minds- it seemed like they just picked him as the killer in that episode and made it obvious in the first couple minutes of the episode. Now it seems for the next season Jason has joined an anti-vampire church and so will continue being more stupid than ever and taking up time where we could be doing so many better things, like throwing salt in our eyes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is the most pretentious dribbling sappy excuse for drama on television. The premise is trite with casting that scrapes the bottom of the barrel. I'd give this a zero if I wasn't such a die hard fan of Six feet Under (well at least the first two seasons). I've never read the books and after watching two episodes I don't think I ever will. If I was from the South I would be offended by the portrayal of hedonistic, judgemental, one dimensional caricatures portrayed here. Also, absolutely no chemistry with any of the cast members. I really want to know who is blowing the reviewers that are giving this show scores above a 5 (LA Times seems to be the last bastion of sanity.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved the books, Hate the show! Really disappointing, not anything like the wonderful Southern Vampire Mystery books. This could have been so great, what a bummer!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty terrible. Going in I thought this would be something like a combination of 24 and Heroes, not so. I expected a realistic depiction of what would happen if the government employed humans with superpowers; think political assassinations, foiling terrorist plots, or covert military ops. Instead this is nothing but drama "lite," with cheesy jokes and dialogue. Are we really supposed to believe that a group of people with superpowers, who have no military or tactical training, is employed by the government to take out various criminal organizations? This show is so unrealistic it's almost laughable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I cannot feel for these characters...when Jake was dangling from the tower I did not care if he fell or not. The father is a little over the top with high anxiety. I will give this show one more try. There is just too much good tv out there to waste my time on this show 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

interesting premise but doesn't follow  through. Terrible pseudoscience shoved down the viewers throats. Terrible actiing especially with Kiefer Sutherland being like a TV Nick Cage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the show "Boy Meets World" when I was a kid. This equivalent show "Girl Meets World" is not what I was expecting. I waited months to see the hilarious dialect performed on "Girl Meets World" as well as "Boy Meets World", sadly this was not in place. So far in the premiere, it is very cheesy, as how I imagined Disney would make it. The plot is boring, the acting made me cry, and there isn't enough Topanga. Just like Disney would portray it as cheesy,sappy, and stupid. Some Easter Eggs in the show referring to "Boy Meets World" is "Ok". But since the show is made by Disney, I believe it will have no potential, lack of story, and no secret sexual jokes as I enjoyed in the series "Boy Meets World". The good thing about the show, is that Mr. Feeny appeared. I do have to give credit to the show, because its the first episode and its just letting us know who the rest of the characters are. In conclusion, -Bad Things, Not enough Topanga, No sexual jokes(Or funny jokes), horrible acting, horrible script, made by Disney. -Good Things,Mr.Feeny returning. In honesty this made me tear up a bit, knowing that the sequal of my favorite TV series, "Boy Meets Word", is coming to an end. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought I tuned in to a documentary about the local Renaissance Pleasure Faire. What a ridiculous and boring show. "Henry" is but a sniveling brat, spineless and wimpy, whose only claim to fame is a stern face when needed. The priests all look as if they've got serious constipation issues and the women are typical dreamy, skinny models who can't act and aren't convincing for a second. The whole show could be ended if someone would just invent the pacifier and stick one in Henry's mouth. So when do the wives start getting their heads cut off? Guess I'll have to wait until next year to find out. But I won't be watching, I already know what happens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yet another cliche sitcom which brings virtually nothing new to the table. The character structure is painfully formulaic in nature. Not a single character has any more depth beyond what the i assumed at first glance. The most irritating aspect of the show however is the feeling i get that the directors assume this is something ive never seen before. The show's flow is occasionally interrupted by an awkward attempt to assign itself  value in discussing important social issues.  the majority of these efforts fall short however, as a lack of engaging dialogue makes any attempt to discuss "more important things" feel very forced. filled with painfully unfunny cliches about african american families, its tough for me to personally find anything else to look forward to while watching this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Awful. The ugly step brother of Modern Family. Terrible characters, bizarre storylines. Just dreadful.

The pilot felt much longer than it actually was. This won't be on my watch list thats for sure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just sat through the pilot for this show.   I was underwhelmed.  It wasn't a sitcom based upon humor, it was a sitcom based upon awkward situations.  It wasn't funny, it was cringe-worthy.

For now, I'm going to leave it on the DVR to record each week, I plan to watch a couple more episodes to see if the humor picks up,   Hopefully it will pick up a bit as the actors get more comfortable working with each other. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found this show to be a little boring and not very funny. It felt way longer than 30 minutes. Don't think I'll continue watching this one. I don't see how so many people find it hilarious. To each their own! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was sort of excited to see Tony Colette. But the show is just so boring. The pilot was dynamic and premise was promising, but it went downhill almost immediately afterwards. Last episode (6) was so bad and predictable, I'm done with this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Though the start of this program had promise  not as a continuing series, though  it is getting more and more implausible.  The doc carries a complete defibrillator around??  And if he was bleeding out, without IV fluids or blood, he would not have been resuscitated.  Sorry, this "series" is going downhill fast! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching Hostages...is not time well spent. I do not care for any of the characters. The daughter is pregnant, the son deals drugs, the husband is cheating on his wife (cant blame him though) and the mother is...scary to look at. This family has had many trials and tribulations throughout the series but I cannot find myself cheering for them to escape or breathing a sigh of disappointment when they almost do. The one person whose presence is felt on screen is Dylan McDermott. But overall, the acting is poor, the writing is unprofessional and it just seems to be a degraded version of...I actually cant think of any television show that I despise so much. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show had a lot of promise and decent production values but the writing and acting are simply horrible, on the caliber of high school. The characters are unimaginative stereotypes which allows you to know what's going to happen in every scene without any effort. After slogging through this premiere ep I couldn't delete it fast enough and to unschedule all future recordings of it - this show needs to be cancelled asap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horrible, annoying, cliche, loud, stupid, and definitely not funny whatsoever. Demi Lovato gives a strong breakout performance, but other than that its crap! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's cute for tweens, but it fails epically in comparison to HSM. The most of the actors cannot act, the choreography is plain, and Demi Lovato moves around way too much during her solo at the Final Jam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Poor execution of an interesting premise.  I love sci-fi and dystopia, so thought this one would be a safe bet.  The show starts with some promise, but wooden acting, awful dialog and increasingly unbelievable characterisation and plot lines make this one to miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, JJ Abrams does not **** into gold. But far worse is here: He can make gold into **** On Lost came JJ, towards the end, with blue eye thereof. But -Revolution- begins badly. The idea is good! But here everything fails. Very hectic and superficial and often unreliable. Then there are too many Walnut Grove-Ingalls family-parts (meaning -> is the eternal vale of tears). I hate these wide-eyed and completely exaggerated facial expressions. Is this so you know, here is cheap feeling to be created where content is missing. The story also loses more and more in depth. And even developed extremely ridiculous, approximately from the 10th episode. This truck was driven extensively against the wall! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The acting, terrible. The story line started good now it's all over the place. The puns, terrible. The script, terrible. The accents, terrible. I'm solely watching this because, it is laugh worthy. Ohh, and try not get confused with the characters because, they all look alike. All the good reviews were totally bought. There's no way anyone is that stupid to miss any of the above issues. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Revolution: Evolving Backwards

It's obvious now that discerning viewers have been spoiled (and not a little surprised) by good television Drama writing in the last decade or so. It's like the Medium finally grew up and the enlightened realized that characters could be deeply explored; that complex plots could be provided with rich episodic exposition; that with good direction and scripts, personal histories and inference could explain hidden, subtle or conflicting motivations; that nuanced development, realistic propositions and believable protaganists framed within the "classic movie” framework, armed with huge multiples of fixed-time, could be raised to an art form.

With dramas such as The Wire, Six Feet Under, Breaking Bad, Band of Brothers, The Sopranos, Mad Men and even the Walking Dead and a handful of others raising the standard of storytelling, television is able to finally surpass the advantage of huge budgets in major feature films primarily by virtue of excellent writing alone. With viewers investing  seasons and years into the "lives" of their favourite characters it's now obvious that when television is good, it can be really, really Good. But, there are always and, it seems, as seldom as not, imitators to those thrones, blatant knock-offs  aplenty.

There are also the plain lazy. Bad writing and directing efforts, entire productions that "kind of get" the salient highlights of those inspirational pack leaders, but miss the point of exceptional TV entirely. Entirely.

This series Revolution reflects the Golden Age of Television. It really does. When drama writers and directors only had to fill a screen for 45 minutes of mindless, directionless, abstract action to attract advertisers. This series certainly must have looked good on paper  once  as a loose idea maybe. Not the way the actual script turned out...

Look: Apocalypse without those fusty, messy and unpredictable Undead beheaded to litter the landscape with, so comparatively low on the special effects bottom line. No questionable, nasty killings like those grubby, greedy gangsters trying to make a dirty buck. No heavy morality plays or transformation of characters to confound or unsettle the viewer, just Good or Evil writ large complete with mock SS uniforms. No clever art production to fuss over just find locations in states of decay, disrepair or neglect. Not too hard to find in the USA these days at all.

The Golden Age of TV was when there were simply no other options. Any plot hole, crap production value, inconsistencies, impossibly invincible heroes, rank stereo-typing and cliche was what viewers expected, generally got and rare was the exception indeed. No other options. Maybe as far back as before renting VHS tapes. Those days before surfing YouTube for sure and aside from Star Trek or The Twilight Zone it was all pretty…lacking and unimaginative. Yet people still watched even worse TV. Until certain groundbreaking series and whether that was Star Trek, The Twilight Zone, it’s just what TV was, in it’s Golden Age.

Revolution takes those same liberties. Big ones that glare like a cathode ray...

- The USA has been seemingly reduced to the size of Rhode Island as characters seem to traverse distances in hours.
- It’s easy to find somebody in Chicago  just walk onto the set.
- Principals in t-shirts with no regard to weather or colder nights. A human can die of exposure at temperatures as high as 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Each has a smallish backpack supposedly containing: food, water, extra clothing, tools, explosives, wiring, fuses, shaving toiletries, hair and beauty products, blankets, utensils, etc.
- Mature characters have not gained weight, scarred or added a wrinkle in 15 years. They look exactly the same as present day. One is still even morbidly obese after 15 years of foraging, “hunting” or eating canned food. His beard is the same length now, as is his and everyone else's hair. Most male characters that aren’t clean shaven merely have 5 o’clock shadows illustrating "duress and hardship".
- Every character seemingly has a convenient hostage interest.
- Each character is a stereotype. Either gloating, obvious Evil or a Good person with a conflicted, sketchy back story.
- Acting is deplorable, sets are random, premise seemed interesting but proves ridiculous, characters flip flop and have questionable motives, explosions, art direction is virtually non-existent...

Oh forget it. I could go on and on with this series, I guess I’ll just be lazy too. Everyone seems to be running around  in circles all the time or just making the same speeches every time they’re on camera. So little done with so much, every time one thinks or looks. For the viewer as well as the actors.

But you know, if this really was a Golden Age production there would be no blood at all. Which would seem quite appropriate for such a confused and bloodless series. I’m giving it 2/10 because I’m watching it as a Comedy and that’s just golden to me 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ok I'm not gonna repeat what been said already... Read all the negative reviews because they are all spot on.  What I will add though is.. With all the harsher living people have had to go through. It irks me no end that the young stars look like they came straight out of a Gap clothes store... And afterwards they must have visited a beauty salon... They look better than we do now..  I give this 1 point for having a good idea and 1 point for Gus Fring.
Sanitized kindergarten stuff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea of the show had a great deal of promise. However after watching 2 and a half excruciatingly embarrassing episodes, I've had to turn off as it is so, so bad. Terrible acting, woeful script, unbelievably poor storyline and to top it off mushy patriotic US of A sentiment thrown in! How does absolute tosh like this ever get the funding to see the light of day? It's totally beyond me! Avoid, it's absolute drivel of the highest order!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have given this show a fair shake but too much is too much -- or should I say too little is too little.

First,  as has been noted, the acting leaves much to be desired.  When the star, Tracy Spiridakos, has only two poses -- wooden Indian or stunned teenager, you are in trouble.  I thought she might improve as she got accustomed to the role but no such luck.

Second, even if one could buy the basic premise about a sudden world-wide loss of power, it would be impossible to believe the lack of progress 15 years after  the blackout.  Power "disappeared" but the scientists didn't.

Third, as has been noted, there are too many ridiculous incongruities, as has been mentioned, like the permed hair and makeup. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The combination of Abrams and Kripke might be fantastic, but the pilot unfortunately was not. Yes, it's too early to tell and I'll be waiting a while to really make up my mind but from the pilot it doesn't look good. Wrong casting choices, too many plot-holes, stupid choices and alot of wooden acting. The premise seems OK so maybe with the introduction of new subplots and characters I will end up liking it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The premise is fairly original and had intrigued me from the start and the sets, costumes, and lighting all looked wonderful! The show fell apart for me with the plot and acting. The characters were especially unbelievable, their motives were inconsistent and the acting was ridiculous. All-in-all it might have made a good book and it would have made a great show with different actors and better dialogue but this isn't a show I will be looking forward to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A show set in an apocalyptic world sure seems pretty innocent and clean to me. The only people who look like they actually fought to survive the anarchy and chaos that inevitably ensued are the "bad" guys. If something like that actually happened you would not survive without having to do some horrible things. But this show pretends everyone is living peacefully and there are still ignorance about what is going on. Also the main characters are always clean with fancy clothes. Strange. And the two younger male actors are terrible. You can tell the minute they come on screen because they have skin tight t-shirts and somehow look even cleaner than the rest. I don't get why they cast people like that when they can clearly not act. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really poor.  Most of the characters are too pretty, too "model" and too clean to believe that there's no power.  All their clothes are clean and pressed...how?  The main female character is wearing makeup and skimpy clothing...come on really?  Were supposed to believe this story?  The set designs were the only thing that kept me from voting zero. I couldn't watch 20 minutes of this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Concept is OK.....but half way through the third episode I've had enough - bad acting by the 2 main characters (practically the whole cast) is only slightly worse than the bad writing. There is enough better TV on than to waste anymore time on this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty much a disaster all the way. The show takes an interesting premise (that some force has hit the permanent "off" button on modern technology) and then...fast-forwards right past the interesting part of the premise to "fifteen years later" when everything and everyone is incurably stupid. Let me get this straight--it took 15 years to track down Sgt. Badass Matheson's brother Ben even though the guy is still living in the same neighborhood as he did when the lights went out? Did phonebooks stop working too? Did maps?

Of course, once Ben is tracked down, a wild crossbow and musket battle ensues. So the future belongs to Big 5 Sporting Goods and Civil War reenactors. Why hasn't *anyone grown a beard*? Heh, little 19th century humor there for ya. Of course the re-enactors go marching off leaving half the dead Ben's family still alive behind them including his new (trophy doctor several years younger and blond) wife and crossbow-toting (also blond, also hot) daughter. Who proceed to go off to rescure the one Matheson that the militia managed to capture alive, taking along an improbably fat former Google employee for comic relief. Eventually, of course, the band of three find the lost brother (maybe a day's journey away in the remains of Chicago) and he turns out to be....a swashbuckler! Yargh! No, wait, not that kind of swashbuckler, but the kind that (due to his years of marine training with the dreaded cutlass) is a one man killing machine who has that last bottle of good scotch whisky in the City of Big Shoulders, but is not clever enough to have obtained a single firearm!

I could go on and on with this, but you get the point: the show is not interested in the slightest as to what happened to technology, what it would mean for a society of now hundreds of millions of people to be suddenly without that technology which made the such a population sustainable, or how it would feel to be the puny remnants of a once great country whose technology made it the wealthiest empire in history. No, it's far more interested in ripping off Hunger Games, Walking Dead, Twilight, and the other dozen hit shows it wants to be compared to in order to suck in a large enough percentage of that choice demographic (preteens with credit cards, I guess) to justify whatever target ad rates its demented executives claimed they would be able to achieve once the show reached escape velocity. But it's going to fall right into the same Black Hole of Suckcutta that Lost did, only a whole lot faster. Future generations will call it the "Abrams Effect." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stunningly bad, considering Eric Kripke is at the helm.  I don't have the words to describe how poorly written Revolution is.  And the acting?  Burke and Esposito are doing what they can with terrible material, but Spiridakos is like a robot  an annoying little pouting robot.  I gave it most of a season before weighing in, to see if it found itself along the way.  But it is as bad as ever sixteen episodes in.  What a shame.  I really wanted to like this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Instant reactions:
Commercials:  wow this looks like it might be fantastic
Pilot:  disappointed
Chained heat:  underwhelmed

Actors:  The acting is simply below average.  Am I supposed to feel the same emotions that the protagonists go through?  With the episodes aired, I did not at any time sense any connection to any of the "good guys".  In fact, I'm rooting for the antagonists because their character portrayals have been that much more convincing and genuine.

Plot:  Power goes out.  15 years later a group of rag tag people set out to fix it.

Dialogue:  Written by a high school graduate at best.  I tried my hardest to enjoy all of the aired episodes, but wow it's terrible.  The dialogue makes Harry Potter films seem like Shakespeare.  Honestly, the one line that was supposed to be dramatic was so flat that I laughed.  "You're going to help me... because we're family."  Also, you'll hear this line more than once...

Sets:  Average.  Expecting more out of those cool scenes from the commercials?  I had high hopes in seeing the post-apocalyptic Wrigley Field... Only to realize that the commercials depicted exactly how the show did.  Baseball stadium for less than 10 seconds, cut away to different scene.  That was an insult to viewers... show 5 second clips to draw viewers/suckers in... show an extra 5 seconds in the actual episode.

Costumes:  Not convincing.  Here are a few examples: perfectly oiled hunting boots, immaculately white garments.  Really?  So the power shuts down but dry cleaners and Cole Haan apparently have found a way to maintain their businesses?  Enough said.

Weapons:  Guns, crossbows, knives, pitchforks all present.  What more could you ask for?

Closing comments:  I honestly think more money was spent on marketing than an anything else in Revolution.  They hooked us in with well-cut commercials.  Acting was mostly flat, dialogue laughable, story awful, costumes and sets were average, but unconvincing.  I will continue to watch for a few more episodes to see if it improves, but NBC should know that there's a long list of much more deserving TV shows that have been cancelled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just as I started thinking episode 1 was going to be a great show then it happened. In walks the leader of some army unit pulls up with the good old african american leader.  Anybody ever notice how tv shows movies and even commercials always have him as the boss or the general or manager, etc?
Sorry but if all help broke lose there would be no such authority in this circumstance.
Any way, I will not be watching this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yuck! What is with these shows where everyone is single and jujmping in and out of bed with strangers. Tell me, when this character was flying in and out of bed with a total stranger, was her son supposed to be in the other room? What class (?!). This to me is not funny. I kept thinking, how do people get their teenage daughters keep them from being seduced by strangers who could be dangerous, when these women on every sit-com are doing just that? What message do you really want to tell kids? On one hand, you scare about the violence and terrible people in the world, and the other, you say, but go ahead and pick up strange men and have sex with just anybody. Why are women trying so hard to be men? This single women-acting like men routine is very boring and completely unfunny. This tries WAY too hard to be funny as well. Way to exaggerated... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Julia L-D's portrayal of Christine is shrill and wheedling, grating my nerves like cheese. I liked her on Seinfeld, but for this go-round, I inwardly groaned too many times to count. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lazy, tired, by-the-numbers sitcom crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is so mindless and stupid, you won't be able to sit through the 30 minutes. the jokes are weak and laughter is forced, and you'd be better off watching "the class" or "how i met your mother". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Painfully bogus science makes this show the worst of the many new alien invasion shows. My disbelief was definitely not suspended, as there simply is too much to disbelieve. What a waste of otherwise great production values. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I first heard of this, I thought I would like it as I like a good sic-fi, but the problem was it wasn't good. Some might thing it is funny, but I for one don't, and the plot is **** and stopped watching after the second show, mainly apart for not being funny or have a good plot, but because it was only about twenty minutes long. I like my shows to be about forty-five minutes to an hour long.

If you are into **** laughs, with no real plot and short show times, than this is for you... but sadly I don't see how people can like it. It must be a generation, as those born after 2000 seem to have a strange seance of what is funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In the brilliant Office, Brent quipped that Alton Towers was his biggest disappointment. Watching this show I felt like I knew exactly what he meant. Boring, predictable, self plagurisation (so many scenes from the Office re-hashed), far fetched, ridiculous are just some of the words to describe this effort of a show. I'm huge fans of Gervais and Merchant. The Office is perfect, Extras not so but still very good. Life's Too Short is an insult to the fans and viewers. Lazy and moronic. Most of the actors acting like Gervais. If you found Maggie's unbelievable stupidity irritating in Extras then Warricks assistant sinks to even lower levels, not to mention his accountant. Where are the real 3 dimensional characters, Tim and Dawn, everyone in this is a wanker. Each episode needs to be saved by a cameo appearance or by Merchant & Gervais popping up who are undoubtedly funny. I really hope its not the case but this might be the start of the decline of Gervais and to a lesser extent Merchant who has taken off in Hollywood recently 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watch this show as a comedy because it is so bad. The show makes literally no improvements over the last season and it is so stupid. I love making fun of this show. I watch to just see how bad it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Love Laura SanGiacomo, and Holly Hunter, but the material is just downright awful! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The real problem with this show is that Grace works too hard to be a bada$$ - you know, it's just not believable to me. It's not that a woman can't be tough - she can - but as much as I love Holly Hunter, it just seems like both she and her character are acting on steroids. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

corny, nerve.wracking 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing! Holly Hunter is a good actress trying to push some sort of mythical envelope. I would hate to see any of the characters in this show try to deal with any criminal activity anywhere. If the Oklahoma City Police Department is anything like this bunch of oversexed, self-destructive characters then God help Oklahoma City. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a native of Oklahoma, so don't expected an unbiased viewpoint. That said I was sad to see my home state reduced to cliched stereotypes. Cowboys, Indians, football fanatics, cattleranchers and rednecks -- it's true these are all in Oklahoma but the show portrayed them all as one dimensional caractures of people. Holly Hunter was the only character with any dimension. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not my favorite show this year. The closer is much better. Heartland is much better, also. There's been too much hype on this show. They said it was #1 rated cable show before it even came out. It was a big disappointments to me. Won't be watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of those projects that should have never made it past early development stages. Its just plain awful. The odd setups to make him seem that he is actively doing things to lessen the tremors is kind of distracting.  The obligatory mentions of Parkinsons on intervals is needless. The "kids" are actors in their  30's. Casting alone destroys any chance this might have. Weak one liners, family members that don't feel like a family. Poor writing. Painful to watch outdoor one camera scenes. This show is awkward, forced, and unfunny. Its almost like a Saturday Night Live commercial. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I may have found this show amusing when I was in my early teens, because the show has the sense of humor of someone who just hit puberty. The show is filled with dumb comedy, in which you don't have to use a single brain cell to try and understand what they consider "jokes" on the show. The entire series is basically the adventures of a self centered, air-headed woman out of touch with reality and an extremely basic sense of humor. The audience gets to watch her interact with "normal" people, which is very silly, but not particularly funny. I personally found the show a waste of time, and it hurts my head to try and think about it afterwards. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

boring 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Puerile, dull and tasteless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Silverman is that annoying, pedantic little girl in high school who everyone pretends to like out of fear or lack of understanding. This show makes your skin crawl and Silverman is every bit as sticky and schticky as she has been. The only saving graces are Sarah's laid back, less than metro gay neighbors who make you think "I know a guy just like that." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is beyond annoying to me. I think Sarah Silverman is funny at times, but this show is just awful! Her high pitched whine and juvenille humor get old fast! I love Brian, but he can't carry this show with his brief appearances. My husband loves it. Just prooves that I married a giant man child.. Oh well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An pre-teen version of myself might have found this show to be hilarious, but Ms. Silverman is about a decade too late. Extremely childish. Comedy shows on Nickelodeon are funnier than this, and they were MADE for kids. I think this show has the wrong target audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Calling this show immature doesn't even begin to describe it. It doesn't even deserve to have anything more said about. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The 2 goes to Brian Posehn, whos brilliant, unlike the rest of the cast. I really tried to like this show, but like many of comedy central's shows newer shows I relys to heavily on "shock" comedy, sans the comedy. People who like this show tend to be guys who think Sarah Silverman is just ugly, and crazy enough to get, or single, overweight women who laugh when their friends fart. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like borat or south park sans the social commentary. Or in other words, shit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

painfully unfunny. if she weren't so hot, she wouldn't even have a career, much less this awkward attempt at a television show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Funny thing about shock humor: Without the humor part of it, it's worthless. Rather like me standing in the middle of a mall and yelling "Gays and Jews!" There's no set-up, no context that makes it funny. The Sarah Silverman program is rather like a TV Show with Tourette's Syndrome. It yells "obscene" things really loud, a lot, and pretty randomly. Like a person with Tourette's, it does elicit an awkward chuckle the first time or two. After that, there is only an ever-increasing sense of pity for the show, and for anyone who actually does find it funny. If you are interested in shock humor that actually works, because it understands the need for set-up, context, timing, etc., feel free to check out Family Guy, South Park, recent George Carlin, the movie Bad Santa, or any number of shows/movies/acts written by people who actually have some idea how to harness their talent. It's a dang shame Sarah doesn't fall in that particular boat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is absolutely terrible. While the acting is decent, the characters are ALL annoying and very uninteresting. Very little of the show is actually funny and I found it painful to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First: the show is boring, and stupid. Second: the last time I was at CBGBs, the Hanson kids were hanging out with Debbie Harry (of Blondie) sitting at her table and enjoying each others' company. So believe me when I say they're hardly uncool. And Mmm-Bop was a pretty good tune, ubiquity notwithstanding. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What was that?! Where was I supposed to laugh?! Please somebody tickle me, for NBCâ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed in the pilot.  Maya Rudolph - too over the top.  Will Arnett - usually funny, bland here, seems lost.  Christina Applegate isn't much of an actress. and this proves it.  But worst was the script - just not funny.  Premise seems dated - daddy stays at home to care for the baby.  Wife works in TV production - so not the real world.  One of the running jokes is that the parents say **** and **** a lot around the baby, which of course gets beeped, and then they say, "we have to stop talking like this around the baby."  Once would have been fine, but they keep doing it over and over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i found  two episode funny but rest of it i just did not get into it christina applegate was my favorite actress in married with children as kelly but none less if show would get better i watch it guess that why australia has not air this show 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They bumped Community for this P.O.S. family show. Don't we already have a tons of those shows on tv. Super unoriginal, I expected at least a little comedy from a Will Arnett show.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel like I'm watching Cloud Atlas as a less interesting TV Show.

The story was nothing but a diatribe about new age spiritualism,  much as the second and third Matrix movies were. It became a heavy handed pro-Buddhist, pro-LGBT, anti-conservatism. And I am not a conservative. But I want to watch something for it story, not to see to be told how smart and deep the writers and directors are.

And the close-up on the **** shinning and dripping in female vaginal liquids, after a graphic sex scene of the two lesbians, was unnecessary and disgusting.  And I have nothing against gays.

But would you show a close up of a used condom filled with semen after a man had sex? No you would not.

Ignoring the preachy heavy handed and often didactic dialogue that just had to explain every philosophy and even what sen-sates are...it still had a boring and uninteresting story.

How original; people from different  background and places brought together by events in the story... like that trope hasn't been beat to death yet. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I consider myself to be a democratic socialist in the political spectrum and a pure libertarian on social issues so, to be clear, this is not an indictment on activism for the myriad of gender and sexual identities. That being said, this television show felt like a Wachowski brother/sister pulpit on transgender issues in the first two episodes.

To be clear, I am very supportive of the agenda politically, but it felt ham-fisted and contained an enormous monologue that did not further the plot. If somehow a person achieves a superpower, I assure you that that person is probably not sitting around worrying about how to write a blog post about a pride parade, but either believing they are going crazy or freaking out elsewhere.

The show is loaded with loaded cultural stereotypes, including such favorites as:

arranged marriages in India,
American jackbooted thugs in the security services,
ignoring of women in Korean business culture,
drugs in electronic music,
unredeemable black youths vs. white police in American urban areas,
effeminate, yet masculine, latino gay men (and an abusive Latino ex-boyfriend who just can't let go!)
tribalism in East Africa, and, last but not least,
Eastern European criminals

I'm not trying to sound so plot-heavy, but there innumerably scenes that don't further any agenda. The show is belabored, but not in a way that appears purposeful. They appear to be hitting on what I like to call the HBO/AMC agenda: add a lot of sundry trauma to every character's past, make sure that characters' lives do not improve for a lengthy period of time, but, Sense8 differs in one way, every character's decision is black or white, which makes the moralizing that much more obnoxious, since it lacks depth.

Also, while I cannot speak for other viewers, I could not care any less about any of the main characters. The most compelling was the policeman, who is the only actor I had recognized from before.

God, spare me another moment of this show by bringing me a new Hannibal or Arrested Development.

Also, what show needs 2+ minutes of a theme intro... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really, REALLY tried to get into this but after 3 hours of watching it just felt like it was all style and no substance. Visually slick, but the slow pace of plot and character development couldn't keep me watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not a huge fan.  I liked most of the characters, but about half way through the second episode it just fell apart.  It's a shame too because after the first episode I really thought this would be a great show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was expecting the worse from the TV Land ads. I was right - this show is AWFUL!! Wow, Jane Leeves, Wendy Malick, I guess the writers from "Frasier" were nowhere to be found.. TV Land airs some great, classic shows. This is definitely not one of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show had so much hype and promise of a great new comedy of the year.  I kept watching and waiting for it to get funny and sadly it just never really did.   It just felt flat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A show that started somewhat good turned to crap later in the season. Horrible acting, dialogue, and plot lines made this series a complete dud. Glad it was cancelled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought that FOX could do it better. Having into the game such a director as Jon Cassar, they could do it better, but the script is horrible! We can advance everything that is going to happen. If the shows continues like this, is going to fall quick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How could they spend so much money and create something so boring. Great opening and cool transition to T.N., and then wake me up when something happens besides a dreary family sitcom. Watched the 3rd episode, just in case, and the same mix of some action and mind-numbing camp life. It's a shame whoever created the show tried to appeal to such a wide variety of tastes that it just comes off bland. What a waste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was simply boring; every minute and every move could be foreseen and nothing surprising happened. The opening double episode was full of cliches. Unfortunately, now I foresee a dumb Jurassic Park-themed series instead of a promising sci-fi story. Too bad! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is by far one of the worst sci-fi shows I've seen in a while. Bad stories, hollow characters and rip-offs of much better sci-fi shows and movies are only the beginning of this shows problems. There is little to no character development, romance subplots that are on par with Twilight, villains with motivations so cliche (or unexplained) that it unbearable, moments that would've had emotional weight if it wasn't for the characters lack of development of personality.
The story arc is insultingly moronic, and there are moments that are so stupid that it makes me just toss a grenade in Brannon Braga's living room.
There is nothing to see here. If you want a dose of dino action then watch the Jurassic Park movies, if you want human vs. human conflict then watch Jericho, and if you want a time travel adventure then watch Doctor Who.
DO NOT WATCH THIS!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible terrible terrible. But I give it points for what it could have been, sans the script written by what seems like the folks from ABC Family. And it could have been so much more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was actually so bad I was laughing half the time! Wow what a waste of time. The first four hours of this show prove it to be shallow in plot and quality. The characters are again American cliche in what appears to be a soap opera remake of Avatar. There is no reasoning behind any of it. I am sure it in no way does the book plot justice. I wonder what drugs Spielberg was on when he was producing this crap. It's funny to note, those that liked "lost" rate this show.Â In conclusion it is proof American television has lost touch with intelligent viewers. BBC documentaries or Blade Runner any day! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the most important things for lending credibility to fictional characters is them them ask the questions and think the thoughts that normal human beings in their place would ask and think. The characters in Terra Nova fail doing so over and over again, leading to a cast made up mostly of zombies, staggering their way through badly written storywork. While the basic concepts of time travel, pollution and exodus are all potentially interesting, the execution is very bad. The Terra Nova colony is doomed to fail, because it's colonists have neither any frontier spirit, not much in the way of brains to make up for it.Yet, sometimes when stories and acting are bad, at least the design, props and special effects make up for it a little bit. This is not the case here, unfortunately. The visual impression suggests that someone went through the concept art trashcans of Jurassic Park, Avatar, Earth 2 and Lost, then picked all the worst pieces he could find and copy them badly.It is not a complete waste of time, but it is second to almost anything. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You'd think that the reason Spielberg has waited so long to produce a TV series about dinosaurs is that he was waiting  for technology to catch up so that creatures that live up the standards set by Spielberg's own Jurassic Park became affordable for a TV-budget.Sadly, this is not true. Not a single dinosaur looked believable. I'm not even sure the series reached up to Walking with Dinosaurs when it comes to paleovisual believability. The dinosaurs simply don't move or behave in a convincing fashion, looking more like something taken out of the Attack of the Clones arena that the terrifying animals we saw in 1993.Storywise? While there was a potential for "Lord of the Flies" with raptors, this is "Lost in the Cretaceous". It's a telling fact only the "bad" humans (shockingly characterized by a rugged appearance) actually get eaten, whole 5 teenagers who get cornered out in the forest by a pack of what is probably 500-kg predators survive with only flesh wounds and a minor leg fracture. I had a hard time deciding which of the main male characters is a more entitled douche. The father who decides to have a third child in a world dying from overpopulation, then assaults police officers and gets locked up leaving his family to fend for themselves? The clueless teenager who meets a cute girl on the first day, somehow instantly makes a lot of friends, and then decides to scamper off into the primeval jungle, predator-infested jungle to drink moonshine?Bottom line? It's by all means watchable, but if you where expecting "Galactica" with dinosaurs, sorry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A 65 average critic score for this debacle of a show?  Are you serious?  I just wasted 2 hours of my life that I can't get back.  I was hoping for way more of a sci-fi/adventure type story but this ended up being a soap opera in the prehistoric days.  Awful, really really awful.  Do not waste your time with this show as it will be canceled during the first season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is another disappointing show this season.  I love dinosaurs and I love a hokey story but this is
sterile.  The characters are unlikeable - a cop that thumbs his nose at authority by having a third child? and then fails to protect the child? he is going to be the hero? doctor mom loves the hothead? what?

The dinosaurs are just like in Jurassic Park- they do not have reality apart from the humans.  Boring, boring, boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So Spielberg! Very boring and politically correct, with a "Happy family" characters that was the sum of all stereotype in generalistic TVShow. Not to mention the lot of plot-hole and all the question that pops in your mind watching it (one for all: dad breaks from a maximum security prison and enter in another maximum security facility with no tool, no breather. And magically become the most bad-ass cop in the colony. Bah! Visual effect are simply embarassing. Another Falling Skies!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

From the acting; to the writing; to the direction and special effects; Terra Nova is a cesspool of dreck that does not succeed in any aspect. It's a thinly disguised family drama centering around a family of five as they try and cope with life in 'the new world'. Luring you in with its promise of sci-fi and dinosaurs, Terra Nova quickly makes it obvious that they have neither the budget nor inclination to provide anything of the sort. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seeing as the premise for this show involved people travelling back in time to the age of the dinosaurs I wasn’t exactly expecting a drama series with the emotional depth of something like Breaking Bad or Mad Men. What I was expecting however was to be entertained (Spielberg was responsible for Jurassic Park after all!) unfortunately, despite all the pre-pilot hype, Terra Nova fails on almost every count. The much hyped special effects are almost laughable in places and are still leagues behind modern day big budget movies, or the 15 year old Jurassic Park for that matter, and the action sequences lack any tension or sense of danger. Add to this the fact that the characters are so clichéd, the dialogue so cheesy and the plotlines so incredibly dull that it is impossible to even begin to care about their plight and you have an example of what happens when TV goes wrong. Fortunately thanks to rapidly declining viewers in the US a second season now looks unlikely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, so Stephen Spielberg can't do TV. That's okay. His CV is already pretty impressive. We'll just give him a pass on this mediocre tripe that's basically Falling Skies, only with dinosaurs instead of aliens. Where Falling Skies had "skitters", Terra Nova has "slashers". It falls prey to the same cheap serial TV tricks that Falling Skies did (too much CGI, generic music meandering in the background with little relevance to the action, lame plot devices) and focuses on much the same issues (survival of the human race, father/son stuff, boy/girl stuff). It had potential, but it's a flop. There are too many holes. The dinosaurs themselves are not featured enough, and when they are, they're just angry monsters, not complex zoological marvels. Nobody seems to mind that their new community is an autocracy. Nobody knows any body else, and although there can't be accommodation for more than 100 people, and there's never more than 20 people milling around the open-air "market", they all seem to be strangers to one another. Despite the dangers, teenagers live alone and regularly climb through the fence to jump off waterfalls and drink spurious jungle-brewed moonshine. Shelley Conn, the doctor, is a good character and a good actress, and I'm glad they're letting her use her own accent, but I don't understand how she (apparently a medical doctor) knows so much about virtually every aspect of modern and prehistoric science. Also, there seems to be a lack of nurses. She recently recruited a moonshine-abusing teenager to pull a 6 foot parasite out of a patient. Why? That teenager is the very annoying "Skye", who knows an awful lot about illicit activities, and runs around doing her own thing and flirting shamelessly with Josh who, frankly, could do better. Landon Liboiron is good as Josh, and Naomi Scott is equally good as his sister (although she and her wholesome boyfriend already behave like a married middle-aged couple). In fact, the whole Shannon family is well cast. I just wish they weren't subject to the same cliched issues as every family in every tv show ever (daughters dating, father and son conflict, baby sister in danger, mom and/or dad torn between work and family, mother's old boyfriend pulling strings to bring his old flame back from the future). Jason O'Mara is fantastic, and the best thing about this mostly lame production. I wish he had better stuff to work with, because he's very warm and watchable on screen. I just don't totally get what this show is about. The mood shifts constantly, and it's often just plain silly. As in the episode where Dr Shannon loses her memory, attempts at humour fall flat, it all descends into farce and just feels really uncool. I don't really get why or how they're trying to rescue humankind by going through a portal to a prehistoric world, and what they're actually trying to accomplish in this tiny village. What do they all do there, who makes the stuff they sell in the market, do they reproduce, why are there enough resources for a bar complete with shady barkeeper with a bad reputation? Who let him in and why? Where does he expect to hide? And what's the deal with these Sixers who frankly don't seem very scary or interesting?Sorry, the show sucks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm watching this drama from Iran. Series is weak, the content and dull. I'm surprised that this series has been spending millions of dollars.Many series have been canceled. I do not know why this series is not canceled 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trevor makes things less funny.  Think about that for a moment... he does the exact opposite of what he's supposed to do as a host.

At times, I'll laugh at a clip they're showing, then when Trevor goes to add his witty comment, the laughter in the room stops.  Every time.  Because it feels like he's just reciting lines.

It's pretty bad when Daniel Tosh does a better job of delivering his lines on his sub-par show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What show did you other people watch? This is about as lame as it comes. The pitch said "Ocean's Eleven" meets "Taxi" - not even close. It's not abysmal only because a couple of the actors are good and the production values are quality. But GEEZ, so weak. This will not get me to switch from watching Deal or No Deal! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slow pitch humor... prolonged and predictable punch lines... and an insult to our intelligence. This is a fraud on the profession of comedians compared to quality shows that showcase witty and/or edgy writing like Arrested Development (RIP) or the Sarah Silverman show. I ask, how drunk or desperate do you have to be to green light such try-hard and derivative crap? And the characters?! Jebus! An ethnic cab driver and a fat black dude... oh wait and a hot-headed New Yorker! Someone earned a paycheck for this? Did Mick Jagger even watch the final product before pimping his name in this flabby attempt at comedy? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show was terrible--the production quality was miserable. The characters never really address the camera directly, it's hard to hear the hosts/judges because they only talk to each other and never face the camera, the lighting is terrible, the music is cheesy. Worst of all, the designers are freak shows--boring freak shows. Truly hard to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A few points for effort in putting a show together, but was it successful? No. I was surprised to find Kelly as one of the judges; I do not feel she has the background to judge, Beyonce's mother would of been a better candidate considering that she has designed costumes for Destiny's Child. I do respect Kelly as an artist just not as a judge. In Project Runway you can probably pick out half of the group as not-so-good designers, the fashion show is 100% not-so-good designers while the judges scramble to find the most bearable contestants for the top three. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to like this show....it's terrible. Long live Heidi,Tim and michael - they rock!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry, I didn't like either isaac or his female sidekick. I thought the apogee came when they kicked off the gal who wasn't familiar with hip hop clothes. Hip hop is so over and done with and the way the two kingpins acted was like the designer had killed someone. Bad, very bad! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found the show boring , the plot was not at all interesting and I did not like some of the actors.... Also the plot repeats it self after a few episodes... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An overcomplicated, and rather tedious followup to a fun and intriguing first season. I hated season two of this show. The acting is still good, and there are some scares here and there, but this season never manages to lift off the ground. The story is schizophrenic, and has no real vision of what it is trying to be. I know I am in the minority here, but seriously    this season left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't watch season three. Disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This feels like a show written by ad guys. Not by guys who know how to write long format. There's no reason for me to connect with these characters either, where as in Mad Men, the characters deal with universal truths and struggles. Mad Men is less about advertising and more about the psychology of a man/men and woman/women in the late '50's - early '60's. I hate the characters in Trust Me because there's nothing real about them. Even jerks have something inside that makes them that way. These guys are just acting. And maybe the one thing we hate worse than ad guys are actors pretending to be be ad guys and not coming across as believable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has got to be one of the worst mini-series efforts in the history of TV. The writing is absolutely abysmal, and the dialogue is laced with the most gratuitous profanity I've ever witnessed. The ex-prez character who's a transparent parody of Bill Clinton is especially offensive and ludicrous, a buffoon who can't utter a sentence not laden with obscenities. A disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As long as the Myspace / Starbucks generation is going strong, this watered down version of The Daily Show will stay on the air. The two stars goes to Colbert for going from top of his class at an Ivy League school to an unfunny program on basic cable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Complete waste of time.  Formulaic, slow moving, cliche' riddled...just **** awful really...after seeing good reviews I was compelled to warn others...a lot of these reviews have to be fake. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Army wives is nothing but non realistic characters acting like trash in a 'soap opera on steroids'!!! Can't we give our fighting and men and women the respect they deserve. Nobody acts like these characters except Hollywood scum! Excuse me but it's the truth!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I give it as high as a two (2) only because a the actors manage to remember their lines and some of the South Carolina location scenes look beautiful. But the story is horrifically - nearly comically bad (on purpose, perhaps?). I've lived the life for the past 17 years and so all I know is my personal experience - and that of my friends, of course. But from this wive's perspective - "Army Wives" is a shameful caricature of some of the most honorable spouses, selfless spouses in our country. I mean come on, people! My husband is the Sergeant Major of an Infantry battalion. I've known my share of drama, gossip, and silliness - but this bizarre sort of 1960s era "us and them" version of officers wives versus enlisted wives and the whole idea that a Lieutenant Colonel's daughter would get preferential treatment at an Army hospital over an enlisted man's son is preposterous. This show is absurd and it is beyond me how it keeps getting high numbers in viewership. I can tell you - it sure doesn't come from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Maybe in the new season, Lifetime will clean house and higher another head writer - maybe someone who has some experience with military families and maybe a budget to higher an experienced technical advisor who rose to more than just the rank of Specialist. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The theme music is WORSE than fingernails on a chalkboard! Ugh! And why is Cartoon Network shoving this show down our throats!? Enough already! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Leftovers is boring, dull and mundane. Not even the talented cast shines in this show which offers viewers nothing but the dourness. Nevertheless, great background music! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty bad. First episode totally did not keep my interest. I'll give it 4 episodes in, because that's how long True Blood got to get me hooked. I was hoping for better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think I gave this series a chance, I watched the first four episodes and found it very frustrating.  Episode 3 was alright but I just couldn't tolerate any longer how coy the producers were about shedding any light on what was happening.  Example:  the Guilty Remnant.  The leftovers who didn't join the GRs must have known something about this cult yet none of that is shared with the viewer.  After four hours all I knew was that the GRs don't speak, wear only white and smoke too much.  The GRs also make the leftovers angry; well The Leftovers made ME angry.  With each passing episode I felt increasingly like a schmuck for watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Leftovers is boring, dull and mundane. Not even the talented cast shines in this show which offers viewers nothing but the dourness. Nevertheless, great background music!

I'll preface this by saying I'm an Atheist.
With that out of the way you can guess what my opinion of this is.

Well you're right. This is utter hogwash, Atheists the world over would dream for the Rapture to happen, so that all the insane and crazy people could disappear and we can live in a world that would quickly start forming unity.

I've seen the pilot and I don't plan to see anything else on it.
I'm done 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted like this show as it has all the elements of a great and meaningful journey. I simply do not know what is going on nor do I want to know. To grab a person and keep their interest in caring for the story to unfold you have to provide something likable about either the characters or an intrigue to the storyline. I felt it failed on both counts.  Am sure there would be lots of folks that love this TV Series but it’s too frustrating for me to even care. It could have been something special but it’s overly pretentious without the credence of twin peaks style intrigue. It’s simply disjointed to the point where the viewer has to try too hard to invest in its development thus appealing to a niche market. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What the heck is this?Ive tried the pilot.I wont watch more of this **** kinda dumb?Some terrible actors in this too, great.And like many other people wrote here:Where are all te funny guys?It seems only depressed and bored people walk the earth in this show.Sorry, i try 3 EPs per show and then comes my conclusion.Will i watch 3 EPs of this show??The pilot was so boring and depressing ill quite right after it!This suckz! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How original?  A large cast of disparate characters all involved in some way in some major mysterious, maybe spiritual, happening and now we'll follow all of them to see how this works out.  I cannot recall watching a more pointlessly depressing television show than the first episode of "The Leftovers".  Is it possible that the title actually refers to some incomplete scripts left over in Mr. Lindelof's refrigerator.

2% of the world's population has mysteriously disappeared.  If that was a spoiler, you must be living on Mars.  In our little target town, three years have passed and no one seems to have been able to get beyond this event or to get on with their lives, raising their children, stop being pointlessly rude to each other, etc., etc.  The entire 75 minutes of the initial episode wallowed in depression and mystery.  OK -- I don't necessarily want to watch "America's Got Talent", but I sure don't need to get down and wallow in misery with this show.  I have instructed my DVR, "ENOUGH"! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Damon Lindeloff, clearly hasn't learned anything from the disastrous finale of Lost nor the plot hole ridden Prometheus...upon the very first minute of watching the Leftovers the viewer is subjected to second rate actors desperately trying to evoke pathos out of second rate script that belongs no where else other than a  thirty minute episode of the twilight zone. The plot according to the advertisements centers around the spontaneous disappearance of some 100 Million people which would probably make for a decent Sci-fi mystery; Damon Lindelof  on the other hand, immediately retrogresses on pursuing that mystery in turn for centering around a pointlessly dreary, "character" driven show that has no stability to go beyond one season... all in all, this show isn't worth the time 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

OMGG...this show is so f'ing boring. It took me 3 hours to get through each of the episodes I watched because it moved so slow. The only thing that even remotely caught my interest was Letty's relationship with her mother and son. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first 2 episodes were interesting and kept me coming back, even though I was not happy with the unnecessary intense sexual tone and odd use of vulgarities.  By the 3rd episode, as much as I loved Michelle Dockery in Downton, I realized this was not for me.  It became a bit boring and except for the scene in which it showed 2 men having intercourse, I found the writing to be very predictable.  What a nasty show it turned out to be. I was so disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's horrible. These actors are bad and the plot is even worse. If you have even a basic knowledge of how prisons are supposed to work, then you will see nothing here is even close to realistic. In the first episode they discuss how the main character's brother is the most dangerous inmate in the place - he hasn't a month to live and no reason to be on his best behavior - and, yet, a few scenes later you see him painting a wall with a couple other inmates (including his brother). Fox's only saving grace on this one (why I gave it a 2) is that I can't imagine how they're going to drag this out for 22 episodes. It's already been, what, 5 episodes and they're practically out. Not to mention the fact that the number of inmates finding out about the escape increases each week - do they all think they're getting out? Last, but not least, why is there an ongoing legal battle? How come they didn't come up with all of this evidence initially? And, what happens if they find enough evidence to prove him innocent and he actually gets out of prison? His brother will still be stuck in there because he actually held up a bank. This series was a case of a new and exciting idea that wasn't supported by new and exciting writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Up until last night - oct 2nd - great show..last one I will watch though..our family voted this to be taken off our have to tape if missed list. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Good premise, bad story progression, terrible acting and a lame, predictable script. I had heard good things about this show, but it's over-rated crap! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I forced myself to sit through the pilot, and it was torture. The idea of a real-life Incredibles for grown-ups is a great one, in my opinion, but this was a terrible execution of it. My main gripe is that it seemed so dumbed-down that I could almost hear the writers saying to each other, "No, our audience is too stupid to understand that. Get rid of it." For example, they kept calling the mother (I've forgotten everyone's names by now) a "scientist", but they are never more specific. As if saying she's a chemist, or a physicist, or a medical researcher, or whatever would confuse us idiotic viewers, they even use the generic "scientist" term in the award she wins (or was it a promotion? I don't remember). And then there's the explanation for how they got their abilities: "The water was glowing. That must have given us our powers." Please. That's so patronizing, and given the woman's career as some kind of general scientist, she should never have been satisfied with that. Yet she's the one who decided it was an amazing explanation! The end hinted at a conspiracy plot, which interested me a little, but not nearly enough to continue watching this. If No Ordinary Family gets a second season after FlashForward was canceled, I swear I'm going to set off a bomb at ABC's Programming offices, then shoot any survivors. This show may as well have been titled "No Decent Writing" instead.-IMP ;) :) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There was genuine potential in the concept - an unqualified temp uses business "bravado" to con his way into a high-profile role in a foreign country, and each time his con is nearly exposed he must double down with a new lie a little bit more invested than the last.  This is what I expected after the first five minutes of the "Increasingly" Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret; a humorous cautionary tale about the dangers of the slippery slope.But make no mistake about it, from the very start Todd Margaret's decisions could not possibly get any worse.  His lies are outrageous and he does a very poor job of covering them up (but boy does he try), and while these bits could be clever and funny, they will make you cringe far more often than you laugh.  I had to fast forward a couple episodes because it was so painful to watch Todd say things that were so contemptibly stupid.  This is one of the biggest flaws - a main character who is not relatable or likeable even on a comic level.Of course, Todd's idiotic charade couldn't possibly continue but for the stupidity of his supporting cast, and, while they always seem modestly suspicious of his lies, they never quite pin him down despite the sheer absurdity of his responses.  Again, I recognize that this is a comedy, so hyperbole is acceptable and even desirable, but the dialogue is so bad it breaks the fourth wall, and Todd's lines actually cross the "so stupid it's funny" line straight into "just plain stupid" territory.I can't help but feel that Cross and Arnett have been desperately trying to capitalize on the success of Arrested Development, Arnett clearly with more success, but do yourself a favor and just demand Arrested Development.  Running Wilde fell well short and Todd Margaret, I believe, falls even shorter despite its promising concept.  Disappointing for sure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You're the Worst is the worst. I'm getting so tired of shows trying to desperately seem edgy and hyper-sexual. It always looks forced and this one is not even funny. I feel embarrassed watching it because they are trying way too hard. I gave it 2 points because the lead actress has potential and should be using it somewhere else. I'm sad that this show is popular. It says a lot about our society. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love unsympathetic characters AND raunchy dialog, and I STILL don't like this show.
It is unfunny, chock-full of cliches that aren't even freshened up convincingly, has 2-dimensional "characters", and lots of R-rated sexy bits.  The acting and writing come out of a can.
It bears repeating: unfunny.

So really, all the show's got is some sexy bits.  If you're looking to watch some sexy bits, may I recommend a place called The Internet?  There's a pretty good supply. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One episode is enough. This show is terrible, The acting by the lead actress is robotic and wooden. The show seems like it could be OK but it isn't going anywhere. The chemistry is not there either and the direction is all over the place. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is WAY! to Predictable, 4 out of the last 5 episodes i have watched i guessed who the killer or killers were at the start of the show......the show doesnt have enough suspence and the drama isnt worth staying around for.. its almost like they hired the llowest paid writers they could get to try and pull off a blockbuster of the year...Good luck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show seemed like a rip off if USA's Psych on a few Valium. Yawn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As hard as I tried I just don’t understand this show. The authorities find a naked woman with tattoos all over her body and the next scene she’s carrying a gun and going after the bad guys. Huh?

Jamie Alexander’s last TV acting role as on another ‘quirky’ show a few years ago called Kyle XY. It seems she likes appearing on such programs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Talk about starting strong and then going down hill fast. The premise and first half of the first season was really pretty good, but by the end of season 1 it was trash... and season 2 doesn't get any better between the bad acting and shaky camera work.  Oh and the plot goes to hell too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I saw a new show featuring the likes of Ellen Barkin and Scott Speedman, I immediately added it to my series playlist on my trusty DVR. I let the first few episodes tape so I could binge watch it a little. I always hoped Speedman would get a chance at another strong television show, and I have had a crush on Ellen Barkin since I saw her in "Switch" and of course, "Sea of Love". Unfortunately, the show is trying to hard to be an alternate universe of Sons  of Anarchy, with a white trash, purposeless group of crooks, who come across as about as far away from Family as one can get. It's not believable that any one of these characters would possess the basic social skills to interact as a close knit group, much less have any success at crime, especially something as discipline heavy as organized armed robbery or a long con. They drive around in new cars and spend money like water,  which comes across as made up. bank robbery is a federal crime, and bank robbers don't last long once you're on the Feds radar. Set all of that aside, and still, it sucks. The writing is crap. I've seen Vampire diaries episode with more believable banter than what these Actors have to say. Whoever told Ellen Barkin, AKA "Smurf" (stupid, weird moniker) to walk up to 6 foot hoodlums and get in right in their face, has never interviewed a real criminal, much less been around any. Just poor acting in general. It's not totally bad, and I don't blame the actors, because there really isn't much going on besides an opportunity to have scene after scene of good looking actors mostly naked, doing drugs, having sex and partying. Unfortunately, Ellen looks pretty terrible, and it ruined my crush watching her trying to be sexy in this. It doesn't work. She's way to skinny in this show. The other long haired dudes are basically meatheads. Hopefully they are trying to act that way, for whatever reason. I get the feeling that someone told them to behave that way, and that they are trying their best, but it's not working. Scott Speedman is astute as ever, with perhaps the only decent timing of the group, but his hair looks like he just stepped out from under a 500.00 haircut stylists chair in every scene. That's not what I picture a rogue would look like. The short haired guy was in prison at Leavenworth but has almost zero tattoos. Really? No prison tats? Okay maybe. But he is cast wrong. Every thing about this show seems contrived and comes off boring and superficial, and just not believable. The women in this show besides Barkin look like they stepped out of Victorias Secret or Fast and Furious, but from the extras department, not the main characters. They come across as sterile and too perfect. I've met real criminals, and their women, and they don't look like that. Sons of Anarchy was much closer. There is a faded beauty, and perhaps a certain charisma, in a bad guy, and very few bad guys are as all bad as these guys are, especially to their families. If they are, they wind up in prison, or dead, and fast.  The best ones are usually pretty lovable, until they break your neck and take all your stuff.  The only one who embodies this in the least, is Speedman, but the haircut and the poor script kills it. Get a clue, TV Land.  There would have been plenty of other ways to play, and tell, this story, and it certainly has potential, but that's about it.
Too bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i didnt like it ... it throwns to you too much i think ( i didnt read the books) so i was trying to understand on the first 3 chapters and when all things come togheter is nothing from another world really, actually is quite boring maybe it needs more action and less mixed plots and tons of dialogue 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Undesirable characters, too dark, audio track is muddy and garbled, graphics are OK mainly because everything is nearly black and detail of the "scenes" cannot be seen. This is one of the poorest attemtpts at "Blade Runner" like SciFi I have ever tried to watch. I recorded several episodes, starting with the first and was never able to understand what the hell the story line was supposed to be. As I write this, I presume this mess has been cancelled. If not, please do. It is garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Expanse uses every production trick in the book to hide its true colours. This is not science fiction. It is a simple detective noir set in space, with blind alleys of bioterror and political intrigue that come to nothing, develop no remarkable characters, reveal nothing about the human condition, and leave nowhere interesting to go. Everyone is either brutal or corrupt or downtrodden, except for the reluctant hero. The characters are cliches, the acting is wooden, and the lighting is gloomy to hide the cheap sets. The episodes take far too long to tell a very simple story. This is strictly a show to leave playing in the background. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The CGI is good and that's about all I can recommend about this.

Incredibly poor casting (stock TV actors with abs and no acting talent), cheesy dialogue, a lack of basic storytelling ability, poor shot framing and direction. This is probably decent by average TV standards, but wayyyy below what we are willing to watch.

It's a shame, it sounds like the general plot and world would be interesting, but the showrunners have no taste and very limited ability. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave it a 2 because the story gave a sense of the feelings during that period. It gets a F for historical accuracy. And the thing is, it did not have to be. They could have gotten many things right and still had a great story. The most glaring of many mistakes was the failure to show why Gage left Boston. Washington with the help of John Knox put a cannonade on Dorchester Heights threatening the fleet. He left to preserve the fleet. Otherwise he would have not of left. It is a great story.  Really disappointing for those, unlike the critics, who know the history. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

LAME! OK I get that no one wants to see Sam Adams as he truly was, a portly 43 year guy. Fine, this is   TV, make everyone younger and prettier, I can deal with that. But then they MESS with REAL STORY- making up a lot of stuff!! There is no evidence that Sam Adams was at the Boston Massacre, let alone that he BEAT the British Soldier who "fired first".  Paul Revere never made it to Bartlett's Farm, let alone led the Patriots into ambushing the British there. And so on. Ending with him being at the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Totally made up stuff!! Like the "real story" wasn't good enough.  This mini-series was ok, if you don't know the real story. If you do, it sucked. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"Mind of Mencia" lite. Suggesting this show is a worthy replacement for the Chappelle Show is disgusting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely horrible....i used to like David, however this show is so ridiculous its painful. I forced myself to sit down and try to watch the show, just to see if it would pick up its pace...it failed...can not compare to chappelle show, so stop before you start....this would be funny to an audience who is clueless on black community, however the humor is old, outdated and just plain boring im sorry...You can find just about any one that could throw together some crap like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The potential was there but it was terrible execution of this show. There were a few funny moments but it was mostly trash and it was pretty boring as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The best way I can describe the plot and the characterizations of Wayward Pines is to imagine a moderately creative but nuance-deprived 12-year old had a school assignment to make up a mysterious TV show and write an episode every week.  He then plopped down on the couch, watched Twin Peaks and Lost, and figured if he took about 50% from each no one would realize he was plagiarizing.  Unfortunately he didn't steal from the good/clever/stylish/interesting/believable parts, he just grabbed the surface-level, in-your-face surprising/wacko bits.

Actually all you need to know is already there in the title: "Wayward Pines" - it's "Twin Peaks", except they went with "Wayward" instead of something more realistic like "Twin" to hit you over the head that the place is weird.

Note: If this actually turns out to have been written and directed by a 12-year-old, I will change my rating to an 8 to encourage the kid to keep at it.  Once he has another 6 to 20 years life experience and a lot of creative writing classes, I suspect he could turn out some brilliant stuff... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Unoriginal steals concept from Lost and Under the Dome.  SHAMalan should keep away from all areas of filmmaking even catering and being a chauffer on sets . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'd be just as happy if I never saw this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Turned it off before it was over. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Totally transparent, predictable and annoying! I'm forced to watch it every week, and the BEST part of each episode are the shots of NYC. Every other aspect of the show is horrible, even Peter Krause, which is a big surprise.

Would of been a great series but, the lefty leading man is a big Yawn!!
not enough sexual tension to keep me from recurrently falling asleep.

(the leading man wasn’t even a good sleeping pill)

I really don't watch television to be patronized. Which leaves precious little to enjoy.

Sorkin has overseen some passable television, some of it excellent, but Season 2 of the Newsroom desperately needed to begin with more than a continuation of grating condescension, too-obvious plot patches (i.e. must ensure sexual tension between Maggie and Jim goes unresolved by sending one out on the Romney campaign and the other to Africa thereby extending their unrequited attraction so that now there's two in the show (oh and another looming with Sloan and Don) so that we're covered there), some blatant, telegraphed slapstick and a few quips.

The news is being forgotten. They've taken the news out of the Newsroom. There's an opportunity being missed to show another side to how our "news" stations have reported on important issues of the past few years, albeit with the complete opposite single eye and with a revisionist's pen. I know it has to be entertaining, but can it not be intelligently so? Or will that not sell  what happened to the 'mission to civilize'?

Oh and finally, Neal Sampat's social media and internet geek/fanboy caricature makes me want to vomit. Seriously, I think I cry tears of blood each time his earnest little platitudes insult my cochlea.

This is a country song with a well-hung riff. Apparently the only way we can accept a male hooker is to make him the most pathetic and miserable person possible -- divorce, fire, crap kids, broke, pussy neighbor, etc. The Chicago Sun-Times thinks there are "worse ways to spend your nights than with Ray Drecker." I think the Sun-Times has a very limited social life.

Story line is BORING and Dumb...Special effects looks worse than 1997 Star Wars Special Editions....Honestly I don't know how it still airs...and the casting is meh...and don't tell me you don't notice the overuse of green screens...The Star Wars Prequels look better....

Okay... where to begin. First of all let's kill a certain cliche that claims all women like this show. I didn't, and that's because I found it pretty boring and poorly written. It's an interesting idea that all the fairytale characters are put in the real world, but it has been done before, so I expected something original. All I got were plot twists that were unreal and characters I didn't find interesting at all. For example the protagonist, Emma, she's supposed to be some kind of detective or people finder or whatever and one day her kid Henry  (that she left for adoption after he was born) pops up at her door and says she has to help him. So she finds herself in a small town called Storybrooke (ugh what a lame name) and it's run by a mayor who is really  the Evil Queen from Snow White and her curse brought every fairytale creature in there so they could suffer and she could have a happy ending. I don't get it. Where is the suffering or the happy ending. Just a lame town with lame people. And suddenly Emma and Regina(the Queen) start to fight over Henry. Their dialogue is just ridiculous, like in Days of Our Lives or something. Also the huntsman who was supposed to kill Snow but didn't and then the Queen got mad and took his heart so she could make him her bed slave and then he kisses Emma and starts to remember and then the Queen kills him by crushing his heart while him and Emma make out??? I mean what? Why? And why is Red Riding Hood a slutty waitress? The plot is just awkward, there's so many things missing and so many things that need not to be there. It reminds me of Pirates of the Caribbean movies or the Hobbit. Too much but at the same time too little.  In the series even the costumes remind me of how sentimental it is. What I wanted was the world of forgotten fairy tales. Myths all over the world. What about stories we don't hear often? And there could have been a world more like in Snow White and the Huntsman (even though it wasn't a great movie it was visually awesome, more darker and stranger). Finally, there was only one character in the series that I liked and that was Rumpelstiltskin/Mr. Gold (I'm from Finland so here it's "Tittelintuure"). Mostly I think because he was played by Robert Carlyle who is one of my favorite actors. I'm truly disappointed and hope that the Grimm will be better, starting to watch it now. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Generic is probably the word that best describes this series. It was extremely painful for me to sit through all 22 episodes. I'm having a hard time believing some of the critics called this show "clever" or "smart" because it is anything but smart. I wanted to like this show as I'm a huge fan of The Wolf Among Us, a video game with a similar premise. However, the show proved to have just far too many problems:
- The story often lacks logic, and the characters make unintelligent decisions all the time.
- The show is too inconsistent. There are few episodes that have some fresh stories, and the majority of others that are totally unoriginal and thus unbelievably boring.
- The characters are comically one-dimensional, and the acting often feels extremely soapy.
- Production values are horrifically low. Everything looks ridiculously cheap, and the CGI is just horrible.
- The Storybrooke events are too slow-paced. The finale was a good payoff, but why couldn't they just speed things up before? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Zach Stone Is Gonna Be Famous overall reads like a stale and done many times before comedy show. Although a great idea for a series, Bo Burnham went in over his head in taking a lead role. Ironically showing his need to be famous is valued above a top tier actor who would have done the role better. Claiming to be birthed from other mockumentaries like "The Office" Zach Stone plays a much worse, more annoying, and more awkward Michael Scott, so awkward in fact that the show stops becoming enjoyable, and turns into an all out cringe-fest. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I mostly agree with LP68CA about this show. I love Zooey Deschanel, but this was just terrible. The show felt stilted and poorly edited/directed in general. Zooey's character is far too beautiful to be believable as a girl that has a hard time with men. And seriously, that Lord of the Rings crack? Are we back in the 80s where the world is divided into nerds and jocks? We do realize that most guys that love Deschanel do not typically fall into the "jock" category right? The guys are okay in hindsight, but the douchebag one was just plain corny. The only one whose name I remember is Coach, and he was just okay too. Also, why does Douchebag go with the other two to save Zooey at the end? Are two of them not enough? The show just reeks of lazy writing. Everything is cookie-cutter hoping that Zooey's adorability will save the show - but it won't. As great as she is, she's got a terribly unrelatable character to portray with one-dimensional characters to interact with. The 2 points my review grants are for 1) casting Zooey and 2) the douchebag jar - the one good joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've watched two episodes of this show and didn't even laugh once. Normally I enjoy Deschanel but her acting in this show is so.... dull. Her quirkiness is just annoying. I can't even say I enjoyed any of the supporting cast. A bomb if there ever was one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Badly written show with little sense of narrative flow or character development--and, for a so-called comedy, it's surprisingly unfunny. Zooey Deschanel has charm but her two costars (whose names I don't want to bother to learn or remember) are untalented and unattractive shlubs (the actors and the characters they play)--who I think the writers want us to find quirky and charming, as opposed to annoying, shallow, and all-too-familiar. The show seems to be written by and for adolescent boys (ones who don't want to grow up)--like much else on the TV and film landscape. It seems like a terrible waste of Zooey's charm and talents to put her in this tired, forgettable show. I can't believe any professional critics or even amateur reviewers think it's one of the best new shows of the fall. What low expectations they must have! For quirky charm and some actual humor, watch "Raising Hope" or "The Middle." How about no more shows about cute girls living with dweeby boys--or about dweeby boys living with each other?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, this is just another sad sitcom, and NO Zooey Deschanel is not good enough to make a bad sitcom look descent (she's not Christina Applegate or Julia Louis-Dreyfus). You'd think people would get tired of these "This is how men work, and this is how women work" sitcoms, but apparently they're not. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm sorry I really wanted to like this show.  But it is horrible!  It's not funny and the guys are just stereotypes of the stupid guys on every other show.  I have watched every episode and it is not getting any better.  Itâ

I'm a big TWD fan and watched with another big TWD fan.  The pilot was so bad that I had to turn it off about halfway through.  The acting was terrible and none of the characters were remotely believable to me.  The characters are what make TWD so good and that aspect was completely lacking in the pilot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

poorly written, poorly cast. absolute rubbish. characters act irrationally and inconsistently the whole time. no plot points pan out or get interesting. the strand is a bad clone of johnson from peep show 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This series is a money-grab by AMC and Robert Kirkman. The pitch was "We'll see the end of civilization". We've seen nothing. There are 16M people in the LA area. It is impossible to evacuate that many people. A lot of people have to get sick, die, and turn in a short timeframe. Influenza and plague have devastated societies in the past yet few people have actually been sick. There has only been 2 walkers in Maddie's neighborhood. One was a suicide. Two walkers is not enough to evacuate a community. It is reasonable that people would be getting sick and dying yet the neighborhood hasn't been exposed to the contagion. No one has Internet, TV or radio in a middle-class neighborhood. The Internet was designed to function after a nuclear war however it has failed after less than 2 weeks because no one allegedly is there to maintain it. Walkers tearing apart stupid characters is boring. Perhaps the series can be saved when better writers are hired. IMO we're being served hot garbage and expected to like it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a fan of the original show, this is a swing and a miss for this spin off. I could sum it's plot up as this: "Junkie knows something weird is happening, nobody else gives half of a f***, and would rather show off their acting chops in slow, boring "character development" tangent stories for the next hour."

In the original show's pilot, we have a car chase which leads to a dazed and confused Rick Grimes waking up from a coma to find himself in a terrifying hellhole. It was exciting and creepy.

In 'Fear of the Walking Dead', we have a stoner getting hit by a car, getting locked up inside a hospital (makes little sense), and half an hour of whining by apathetic LAPD members and a 'Stand and Deliver' style classroom drama that just drags on and on for some time. Apathetic is the best word here, because it doesn't seem like anyone cares what's going on. Even when the zombies show up, it doesn't feel exciting...and that's a bad sign for this spin-off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Utter ****

The show is closer to "Fear the Government" than it's original title. The only episode that is any way entertaining at all is the last one and even that one s full of zombie cliches. The characters are boring, the story is terrible and the show as a whole is an effortless dull cash grab.

Would not recommend, will certainly not come back for the second season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really did not like the characters in this show.  Are these people that we want to survive?  The mom was very rude to the cops and the nurses even though she is an educator so you think she would give other public service people a bit more respect.  I can't stand the "bail my kids out of their situation regardless of their own stupidity" type of parenting.  The step dad finds blood everywhere in the church but seems to see no need to call the authorities.  The kid then commits murder and the parents are already talking about how to get him out of that.  I am hoping that they all get eaten in the second episode and a better group of people becomes the cops. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The pilot for this show was slow and the writing was terrible. I get the idea of the show is partly to explore the effects on everyday people. That is part of the charm of the original series. It is not all about the political elite and extraordinary heroes. It about the human spirit and how various personalities tap into that spirit with varying outcomes.
Okay, so why are these characters doing stupid stuff that no one would do. Why do the police fail to investigate a place that has been named as crack den where a gruesome murder just took place. Sure the witness is a crackhead, but still. So instead, the kids step dad - for no good reason - decides to go and investigate the crack-den gruesome murder scene himself - at night. Sure enough, its true. But does he call the cops? Nope, him and his wife decide to go back and check it out again, alone. Yep, still a crack-den scene of gruesome murder. Does anyone call the cops? No. But then the wife's judgement is so good that she decides to keep the knife wielding of a student just their little harmless secret.

And so on. The characters are just cardboard cut outs, their actions the consequence of just unaccountably stupid plot twists.

Me thinks the writers of this series have contempt for their audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is hiding in the shadow of its big brother. Granted it was not the best opening premiere, but this show was a let down even by normal tv standards. There was family tropes left and right; a daughter who wont listen to her mother and madly in lovely with her bf, a son who is a bad egg, parents who had divorce. It was a bit bland for those used to the walking dead's plot. Now i personally have never been a big fan of the walking dead's dialog(any scene with Carl and his father has horrible dialog) but this show is on par if not a bit worse with its cheesy lines. There is not much to say other than it was a huge let down and not worth watching unless you want to experience some of the lore before the events of the walking dead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's pretty obvious based on one episode that this show is plain garbage. FTWD characters make TWD characters look like brain surgeons in comparison. "Oh, you say you saw your girlfriend feeding off a dead body before attacking you?" "let me just head on down to that crack den, alone, without a weapon and without informing police to see for myself." "oh, it looks like you were telling the truth, let me just bring my wife along for a return trip, without telling police and again without a weapon." "hun, you were right something awful happened here". "ok let's get back to school and not report any of this". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is an unnecessary spin off without much thought, it feels like a cash grab. No much was answered about the walker as the original series. The characters are super dumb, and it's really painful to watch. A lot of the tensions feel very forced and predictable. I feel like the writers are trying too hard to make these characters as dumb as it get, and it really feels unnatural and makes little sense on what they do. Also the characters are not very likable at all, and when you start to realize that you are actually rooting for the zombie to eat them, it's probably time to turn off the show.

Also what's the point of this show? It shows exactly the same perspective as the first, but just different characters, location, and time frame. I feel like once the characters realize what's going on, it's just going to another walking dead with different characters. The series really had a potential, but they really blew it. I would really want to see a miniseries perhaps from the government perspective where the it try to combat the outbreak before civilization ends. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worst spin-off since "Caprica". clearly meant for teenagers. bad acting, stupid storyline, unbelievable, sickening politically correct casting and utterly annoying characters. The story holds great promise, but doesn't live up to its potential. what walkers? there's nothing to fear here but the quality of the coming episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First season was almost passable, but this second season -- ugh.  The boat story should've only lasted a couple episodes, not an entire season.  Acting is super weak, the writing even weaker.  It's a boat story with a few zombies randomly thrown in.  I finally stopped mid-episode last week and said 'no more'. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

While the limited glimpses of the zombies we got were good the terrible writing/acting delivered during the other 95% of the show was dishearteningly bad.

I don't think the character introductions went the way they wanted them to go. Instead of making you care about anyone they introduce the main characters as being people so incredibly stupid you don't want them to live through this. While it's OK to introduce future zombie chow it's not OK to turn the entire cast into this and not even give the courtesy of a smart character you can relate to and pull for through the shows twists and turns.

We have a couple of teachers in a blended family struggling with their heroin addict son who is also apparently the dumbest kid in California. The angsty pointless teenage daughter trying leave town with her art school boyfriend. Some random highschool kid you barely get introduced to trying (badly) to tell people something bad is coming and brandishing a butterknife for self defense (dumb). Then of course the show then ends up being 90% dumb teachers dealing with dumb son's issues (something you probably hear about from other people at work all day long) 5% "wait a minute something is strange here but whatever lalalalala" and 5% "wow there's an actual zombie" to which the three main characters have a very subdued "well that was really odd don't you think" reaction to instead of the realistic reaction which would be to flee in screaming terror or at the very least go get help immediately.

Apparently episode 2 will be more hair pulling of a similar nature. Failed character development and a few zombie teasers again. Bad way to start. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When you have a 90 minute show where nothing happens for a good 85 minutes, you know you're in trouble. Opens well and ends well, but the boring, endless filler in between was unbearable. I assume it was supposed to build character development, but the poor script makes you care less about about them, and actually annoyed. Decent acting by Frank Dillane but this doesn't hold a candle to The Walking Dead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the idea of a slow approach and the outbreak scenes of the zombie apocalypse are usually my favourite bits, so I really should love this. But the scary scenes are not the least bit scary, the gory bits are never cool, but by far the worst are the dialogues though: Irritating enough that a paid team of professional authors can write such a huge pile of crap. How these dialogues got past Robert Kirkman and a test screening audience is a mystery to me. Shame on them though. The dialogue is too bad to even care about logic holes or bad acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I want to punch everyone in the face. boring episode 1 and stupid decisions episode 2. By the end of ep 1, the son, father and mother know that something very weird and dangerous happens. What to do next?... lets split up in 3 group and dont tell anyone about it. Especially our stupid daughter who will run into the arms of his soon to be eating flesh boyfriend...

I know, people in zombie movie dont know **** about zombies... I would have love a fast opening for once.. with smart peoples. They serve us, once again, the chase our kids all over the town while they put themselves in the middle of the danger, hanging up on phone warning. O and by the way, the father is very lacking any skill to make things clear on the phone eather ''there are unkillable, very violent people that try to eat the flesh out of your face all over the town, and it seem to spread very fast, our son is in great danger''... TALK TO PEOPLE...

And why the F** the mother didnt get the giant stack of food the kid had prepare??

This show is dumb. And I really hope we are done chasing and convincing people. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The title "2 Broke Girls" is very appropriate because not only are the girls lacking money but they are also lacking substance. The only thing this show has going for it is Kat Dennings but with the predictable writing and forced jokes makes her seem less entertaining than golf. Just like every CBS comedy, with one exception, "2 Broke Girls" only gets its laughs be throwing 100 jokes at you and hoping for 5 to work. Due to it's unoriginality and lack of depth, I would be surpised if this show finishes season one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When spoilt rich girl Caroline loses her fortune following her father's arrest for fraud she gets a job waitressing, much to the annoyance of struggling new co-worker Max who was hoping to claim the extra hours for herself. When Max realises that Caroline is sleeping in the subway she takes her in and the pair soon strike up an unlikely friendship, centred around raising enough cash to start up their own cupcake shop.

The last twenty years has seen the US produce some truly great sit-coms but unfortunately 2 Broke Girls is not one of them, in fact it is an example of pretty much all that is wrong with comedies aimed at a mainstream audience. At times I found this show almost painful to watch with jokes often forced into the script rather than evolving naturally from the situations that arise, one note characters based on nothing but racial stereotypes and an irritating laugh track that only further emphasises the many, many jokes that simply are not funny.

Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

¿Dónde está la gracia de esto? Las dos protagonistas no tienen ni pizca de humor, son tediosas y los chistes de la serie no tienen nada de gracia, siempre se recurren a cosas muy típicas y las risas de fondo están exageradas. No hay ni un secundario (¡ni uno!) que me guste. Una serie horrible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Annoying acted and very poorly written. I'm as irked as the next person about the 2000 election debacle, but this is pathetic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this show.  The actors are appealing.  But I was so bored during the first half of the show that I couldn't stick with it.  It just seemed like a less funny and more poorly directed version of How I Met Your Mother.  While the latter show went way beyond its expiration date this one seems destined to have an early one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Deleted the show from my DVR schedule tonight.  Couldn't take it anymore...I really wanted to like it.  First several shows were pretty good/average but the show tonight (which I lasted about 25 minutes) was awful.  When the Secretary of State was laughing during a memorial service for one of her friends, that was u acceptable and no Secretary of State would do that...in fact you don't see anyone at level in an audience in the back room giggling with her girlfriends...just ridiculous.  The main plot of a Chinese asylum was just stupid and boring.  Done with this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tea Leoni is highly watchable, the writing is good.  But this show is treacle-laced propaganda designed to make us all comfortable with the wonderful job the US is doing on foreign policy.  The public may not know what is really being done on our behalf, but we must all rest assured that the right thing is always being done by people who are completely sincere, competent acting with the nation's best interests at heart.  Please.  For each episode you watch I prescribe 2 of "House of Cards". 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I gave this show 2 tries and I do not understand the promotional hype CBS has given this show.  The show as well as Tea Leoni are unconvincing.  There is nothing compelling about the dialogs or plot. Leoni's quip "what does he mean by the ball is in your court' and its response were typical of the sophomoric and annoying banter.  The show should not last the season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the first episode because of the hype surrounding it here in Hawaii. I can summarize it with one word: "cliche." The whole relationship between the two cops reminded me of just about every show out there with two detectives trying to catch the "bad guy" (except for the old school show Dragnet, that one was great). The action scenes were very ridiculous. I laughed out loud when the one cop had to jump out of the way as a car almost hit him while smashing into a stopped car in a very local road where you wouldn't be going that fast. I know they weren't aiming for a "serious" crime show here, but you've got to add at least some realism so that your audience has some grip to relate to. Something else that threw me off of this show were the racist comments made by the local who was selling shave ice in North Shore. While racism against white people SOMETIMES (very rare in my case - one time in 6+ years) happens, it does happen. I just don't think that CBS should support racism and show locals in this racist light. I have one question about that scene. Why would a local who lives in North Shore (a tourist spot) and makes money off of the tourists be racist against haoles? I think I've found another cliche. According to TV, it's OK to be racist against whites, but it isn't allowed against any other race. I did watch the rest of the first episode, so it must not have been that awful. I will give it two points. One point is earned because the show is putting money into Hawaii's economy. They get another point because I actually did last through the whole show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Show was painful to watch. Not very funny, pretty bland in general. She likes to speak as if she is the spokesperson for women when she's only speaking for herself.  Some girls actually love it when you cum on their face Amy, some even demand it. You sound like a lame lay anyway. Your show will be cancelled soon so maybe you can go back and work on your bedroom skills instead of just laying there like a fat cow. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just could not get into this show. First, the premiere seemed so forced and rushed...like they had to squeeze in the entire plot all in this episode. And the main alien lady's constant "perfection" demeanor just gets very annoying after a while. Overall, it seems all of the acting is bad. After the second episode...I just couldn't take anymore, I wanted to because this seems like a cool show...but it just isn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this show features a lot of claustrophobic cgi-caged greenroom-filmed scenes. doesn't even try to get a match to the 1984 mini series original props. the artwork is quite decent, which may be necessary not to get in the viewer's face too much. actors faces are actually hd compatible. writing and plot line are unpleasantly bad. filming has a more conservative approach. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Blows it's load in the first few minutes. No suspense. Boring boring boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was really bad. They had taken none of the good parts from the old series. This is just standard "in-the-box" crap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never saw the original, so if it is simply a remake I am wrong. If it is a re-imagination, then I imagine a bunch of producers, writers, etc., sitting in a room and talking about how much they love Obama. I imagine them talking about how nuts these "Tea-Baggers" are, what with their crazy distrust of a benevolent leader. I then imagine them saying, hey, we have a ratings potential here, it seems the "tea-baggers" are becoming a larger faction than we thought...what if...we reinterpret a show to cater to their ill-educated desire to take down Obama? Wouldn't that be special. But hey, we cannot make the political points subtle, no, they are far too stupid to pick up on anything intelligent, complex. I then imagine them laughing, thinking how brilliant they are, not thinking they are simply mocking how out of touch they have become. Not realising that if they wanted to get huge ratings, all they had to do was tap into the HUGE anti-government movement taking place right now, both from the left and the right. This is all my mental machinations, probably wrong, but hey, I found V a laughing stock. I also found it disrespectful. One more drop in the bucket...only problem is...the bucket may soon overflow. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

boring. someone needs to teach these writers how to pace a show. instead of telling the story of one character per episode, they try to jump around and juggle the stories of about 10 characters each episode. the result: by the end you've spent about 5 minutes on each character and the story as a whole has progressed very little. throw in some terrible lines and mediocre acting, and this show's not worth anybody's time. yeah, it's popular now, but that just proves that the general public has really bad taste. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In its defense it seems like it could have a pretty cool plot, but the dialogue and acting are so unbearable that I honestly don't know how anyone can get that far into it. Oh, did I mention the acting was mind-numbingly awful? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My friend had told me that Heroes was a great show and I must watch it. So I started to watch seasons 1-4 the first two were good, but only if you like a show that only gives you questions as answer never giving you the full story. season 4 was the worst ever, from the terrible cast that they had added robert knepper I knew the show was just a waste of time after that. the guy couldnt act drunk after finishing a bottle of Whiskey. then they turn Claire into a lesbian which is cool but come on she could have any chick,  but goes for the bridge troll which is her roommate. i spent 80 hours of my life watching this filth would normally want them back but claire is hot so.....

Just for the record, this series does not typify the Australian sense of humour. I'm Australian and I rarely laughed throughout this painfully uncomfortable series. It should have been better. In the US, Arrested Development tackled awkward topics with grace and wit, and consistently cracked me up throughout three highly polished and immaculately edited seasons. 30Rock also handles race- and gender-related jokes with a light hand and an upbeat attitude (and, crucially, is laugh-out-loud funny). Summer Heights High just failed to elicit a single laugh from me. I think Chris Lilley is childish and self-absorbed; his brand of humour painfully awkward and unfunny. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater - plenty of witty, creative Australians wouldn't spit on Summer Heights High if it was on fire. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm actually a little scared that people gave this movie good reviews... I honestly maybe chuckled once, never laughed, and I liked the actors in the movie..  They tried a little too hard with a joke a second, and almost none of them land. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After feeling they ruined the series with pablum & quirk, I tuned in to the first episode to see if they'd taken a different course, they hadn't, made it through 20 minutes of the first episode then shut it off.  Shame, it was a great show in it's first two seasons, now it's a zombie series waiting to be put out of it's misery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I could not get through the first episode.... the "dark" plot highlights the limits of the hammy overacting, and the limits of the whole OINB idea.  i just kept going "ugh" at ever obvious trope and tic of each character...  It's over...it's been over but last year I didnt want to admit it 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its more like a show for children, with the mugging and goofy faces! Look at the age of the people in the stands ! They need a more mature person with sensible and funny jokes..I did not get one laugh and I have a funny bone.. hopefull time will improve , and I will give him this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Two episodes is enough.  The Event is just another overblown, glossy, Bruckheimer-esque action thriller with a soap opera-ready cast and plot holes big enough to fly the vanishing jetliner through.  The producers clearly wanted to cash in on the popularity of 24 and Lost, but the show lacks the tension and edge that both of those former series managed to carry on occasion.  Despite the mystery of the conspiracy theories and the ulterior motives of some characters, The Event falls flat on several levels.  It doesn't engage the viewer or give us any characters that hold our interest.  It's like one big game of Sims where you drop random people into a prefab plot and just play things out.  If you want intelligence-insulting, mindless action TV with plastic actors and no substance, then The Event is perfect for you.  For all the explosions, bloodcurdling screams, chases and tense confrontations it has, the show simply has a limited brain and no soul. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too much suspension of reality already and the over use of hand-held shake cameras make many parts of this un-watchable.  It implication of a superior race or aliens immediately turned me off.  Show is way too choppy (unless it is trying to corner the ADD crowd).  I was a huge fan of 24 and this is no 24. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total non-event.  This was a shocker.  A poor man's Flashforward, which was another poor man's Lost.  They'll ask infuriating questions about characters we don't care about for the entire season and I already (as you've guessed) just don't care about anyone or anything about this show.  The non-linear story-telling is trite and unsubtle, and the twist at the end screams - oh wow I couldn't think of anything more underwhelming. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite simply, The Event sucks. The primary issues lie in the show's complete and utter ignorance of emotional depth, instead focusing on cryptic dialogue and time-jumping episode structures too deliberate to be intriguing. It's one-dimensional characters exist only as chess pieces in a plot that refuses viewers a glimpse at the board it's being played on, yet expects them to continue buying into increasingly far-fetched story lines. Combine that with atrocious acting, and you have a real disaster of a show.The show's biggest blemish is Blair Underwood, who fails miserably as Elias Martinez, the black Cuban-American president who spends his time angry because nobody respects him or tells him the truth. Underwood is boring and non-authoritative, and always seems to be glaring at something or someone, whether the scene calls for it or not. The casting of Underwood (instead of a Latin-American actor, which NBC initially looked for in casting) cheapens The Event as a 24 clone, and Martinez's "do the right thing" agenda seems overtly Obama-esque, to the point of parody.Jason Ritter is solid in his role as Sean Walker, a video-game programmer whose girlfriend disappears without a trace. Unfortunately, his talent is wasted by writers who ignore every chance to develop Walker into a multi-layered character. Driven by a love for the girl he wants to marry (mysteriously abducted in the pilot), but with only one poorly written, painfully obvious attempt in the pilot to invest viewers in their relationship, their storyline is rendered pointless. Without the dramatic tension, Walker's motives fall flat, and his annoying mannerisms quickly grow tiresome.Why NBC is promoting The Event as a cross between Lost and 24 is beyond me. Without a discernible identity and clear direction, The Event fails to draw viewers into its still-unclear conspiracy. What NBC doesn't understand that Lost and 24 were so good because they had a brain and (more importantly) a heart. Right now, all The Event feels like a cheap, sugar-coated insult to the shows it imitates.Synopsis: With major plot holes and cardboard characters, The Event is nothing but a wasted premise that sacrifices depth for weak thrills and a mirage of true mystery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show easily takes the gold for the most groan-worthy pilot episode I've ever seen. Horrifically dull characters, flat acting, confusing and unnecessary use of anachronistic storytelling for what little story there probably is here. Not to mention that the twist at the end was so ridiculous it immediately had me swearing off watching any more episodes. The entire first episode just feels like filler so that they could drag everything out long enough until the underwhelming special effects "Event" happened. Clearly they couldn't hire any good writers so just went for a cut-and-paste storyline of ideas executed infinitely better in more successful series. You can't grow attached to any of the characters since they're so bland, and it's hard to get excited about the big driving question of the conspiracy considering similar shows such as FlashForward seemed to just hit a dead end before cancellation. This is worth nobodies time and will hopefully vanish from our screens akin to it's "Event" to make way for a series that is actually interesting and original. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Truly awful show. It makes itself seem so complex and exciting by havin flashbacks, upon flashbacks upon flashbacks, inducing headaches figuring out why they had to travel 2 weeks earlier to watch a scene which has no relevance and bad acting. I can barely see any innovation also, no true piece that pulls you in to say 'Wow this is unique and original', it seems more like a hybrid of several hit shows in the past decade, without the substance. This might seem like a horrible review, but my friend recommended it, keeping on telling me that 'honestly it gets better' to be more and more disappointing, with not the best of acting, writing, or content. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i have never ever seen a story with so much holes in it, that it would definitely take an eternity to patch them all up. It was as if they just made up the plot as they went. Because it clearly didn't looked like one that was careful written and planned.
In every sense of the word, this show is absolutely terrible.
With so many obvious cliche, you could completely predict an entire episode after the first five minutes.
I have seen alot of shows and the event without any doubt is up there with the worst. Which makes you wonder just what were they thinking (now that i don't know.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When watching this show I feel as if though the cynical aspect of society and modern debauchery is crawling up my nostrils with the express intent of suffocating my brain. "Men" the introduction score sings insinuating that the behavior of the characters herein reflect some part of the human condition, and the funny about that is entirely lost on me. Yes Alan is the loser and between him and Charlie with his dry wit and chauvinistic attitudes the banter sometimes sparks a laugh. But in essence this is a show entirely built around the idea that the exploration of character flaws make for perfect comedy, fortunately it doesn't work, at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Have not seen an episode yet which created a laugh once or even gave me a smirk. Highly unintelligent and moronic, Two and a Half men is a unfunny sitcom that makes you wonder the taste of television in our society..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2017's first let down. Taboo may be extravaganza, but Tom Hardy is ridiculously self-absorbed og to obsessed being a cool icon instead of being a realistic and empathetic character. I mean, the way he walks.. yeezus! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lazily written and hammy poor acting.  I think they thought they could hide behind the excuse of trying to emulate some b-horror moments.  But b horror has a feel that this lacks utterly.   This is a poorly executed show that straddles the line between really-bad-conventional-comedy and b-horror-tropes-by-people-that-don't-get-b-horror.

It's pretty forgettable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

S L O W  and ultra-formulaic.  Don't bother.  There are so many recent examples of police procedurals that aren't predictable that one wonders why this was even made. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

24 has apparently fired the last of it's good writers and hired nothing but cheap hacks. It's also shed the last of it's believability and completely lost it's unpredictability. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has a good 2 funny jokes in every 20 minutes.After one show I had hoped this would be so bad that it would eventually get funny but they didn't even achieve that. Awful wanne-be Monty Python jokes and there's not much original after the first two episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the show is entertaining  but its history is flawed and revisionist . It is full of self loathing for the west, portraying the crusades as an evil conquest of muslim lands instead of an attempt to stem islamic expansion into the west . It was a response to muslim attempts at world domination . It then went on to perpetuate the myth of islamic science and tolerance . The renaisance in Europe was a direct result of a christian and jewish brain drain from islamic tyrany . Who put up the money for this show , Saudi Arabia? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Beside the embarrassing and easily avoided scientific errors of this show, like looking at 15 nm viruses with optical microscopes and having distinct day-night cycles above the 85°n the real problem with this show is it´s terrible pacing and directing. Some of the actors actually are not that bad but all potential suspense was ruined by odd cuts and a way to convoluted script.
This is one of those shows where people blurt out lines about retroviruses or some other scientific term completely out of context or explanation. I'm normally all over campy sci-fi series like star gate atlantis for instance but this was just atrocious. You cannot make "hard" sci-fi and then have everyone act like either naive amateurs or diabolical bond villains, and on top of that not get your science right.
I started watching because I liked the premise of a present day sci-fi taking place in a remote place, but after watching a couple of episodes I realized that this was not what I was looking for. The show also tries to address some big ethical questions like what can be justified in the name of progress and adoption. This is unfortunately handled in the most hamfisted way imaginable.
All in all this is one of the worst series I've watched in a long time but it kept me watching by promising to give all the answers in the end. I cannot say that I feel satisfied with the answers but at least I think most of the big questions got answered. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show  is so much alike battlestar galactica (from the same guy) that I kept looking for cylons during the all first episode. It has just about the same strengths and weaknesses. This is probably why I could not enjoy it. lots of questions, not a small answer to be expected before long. I will not bother to wait for answers considering how disapointing battlestar's were to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With Ron Moore's name on it, many thought that Helix would at least come close to the heights of Battlestar Galactica. It doesn't. Helix trots out line after line of hackneyed dialogue and increasingly absurd situations where BSG consistently broke the rule of genre television. Characters act like they've undergone a partial lobotomy with absolutely no logic to any of their decisions at any given moment. Their personalities change to fit with the plot's various convoluted turns and you never once get a feel for who they are beneath the chronic stupidity. Its only saving graces are Zagorsky, Ghanimé and Sanada, who at least give some warmth to the one-dimensional characters they play.

If it were repackaged as a parody of genre clichés, Helix would be a masterpiece. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an awful piece of work. Shane goes from Bush-hater to religious fanatic, Nancy gets knocked up again, and everyone's in massive drug wars in the underworld as they struggle to be a crime lord. We don't see anyone smoking weed! Is everyone this tense when they smoke it? Crazy guns, and shit? I don't think so! They should have more occurrences with Nancy talking to weed smokers shooting the sh*t. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i agree with Will A's assessments. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loathe this show, and I wanted to really love it. The judges are the worst-and what IS with that Adler dude's faces? He creeps me out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Come on, top design! I keep watching, though interspersed with other activity b/c it is far too anooying to just sit and watch. This show is sad. I'm sorry. But the designs are sad, the designers are sad, their judges are sad, and todd tiptoeing around in the background just makes it more sad. I'm nto into nasty criticism, but unlike the other bravo shows, todd seems to be more of a lurker than an afficanado. And no offense, sorry, to the contestants, but they seem like cautious students rather than professionals, even beginner mavericks which is waht they should be. Come on, with all the minimalist, white background, clean lines, it is mundane!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing. Why won't Alec Baldwin just go away already? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I LOVE Craig Ferguson! I couldn't bring myself to watch James Corden. However now, the Colbert Show over & Corden comes on. He is overweight, and standing there holding his hands together like he needs the bathroom. It sickens me that he got a studio makeover, is getting advertised & CBS promotes him. I have tried, but I can't watch him without thinking he looks uncomfortable being so heavy. I cant make it thru a show. His carpool karaoke  is a good idea depending on his guest. Cordon panders to his guests, &while he may be sincere, he isn't funny.
Trevor Noah is fantastic replacing John Stewart, with his own brand of humor. James Corden unfortunately just makes me miss Craig Ferguson more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I didn't find it funny, nor did I enjoy it. I can't even remember what it's about, to be fair. I was more annoyed by Wood's performance to get the jokes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Plodding and just rubbish, has some very odd editing, McShane in a bizarre performance and Matthew (Spooks) McFaden (?) has an accent that defies logic and geography in equal measure. Gave up during Episode Two and thought well...hope the Cathedral gets built and who cares 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well... this TV Serie or Movie or whatever that it is..it's just bad... the sceneries and the decoration it's just bad, sometimes there's unnecessary scenes... and plot too.
Please don't watch this Serie or you are gonna just get bored.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horribly over-wirtten, not a note rings true. It thinks it's far more clever and funny then it actually is, and just might trick a few viewers into thinking it is. It somehow makes Toni Colette look like a bad actress, which I never thought before. Her opening monologue to the video camera looked like something in a high school production. All the "alters" are one-dimensional and the handling of multiple personality is pretty embarrassing. The kids are also too witty and clever by half and get really grating really quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fatuous, self-consciously quirky bilge lazily thrown together over a few awful conceits and caricatures. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know what to say...I didn't like her personalities, children, or husband. I get about the same amount of entertainment value from watching commercials. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad actors, bad writing, not even an attempt to follow proper science.

Pseudo science idiocy with popular references, big words and serious faces to hide the emptiness of the scripts. This has nothing to do with at least what X-files was trying to accomplish with some success.

It looks like a soap with unbelievable model actors who for most can't act. And for those who can act, it looks like a chore.

It's a wonder how this show could find an audience ... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Writing is decaying into a show of bull. to compare this show with x-files is to insult x-files where they actually tried to get the science correctly. for example: he was not holding a geiger counter which cannot measure "rads". he was holding a scintillometer which can measure "rads" but does not tick! the show is just badly produced and directed with cinematography amateurish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An overhyped pilot with a predictable yet drawn out plot. The science is--dare I say--a joke, and the lab scenes look reminiscent of MacGyver meets Mr. Wizard. Hopefully it gets better as more of the pattern is revealed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

its just not that good, I could go on why but Id rather give my 3 main reasons why, Sereotypical characters, bad acting, bad general stories. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

come on why so many good reviews ? this show is obviously swill , the overblown graphics are terrible , the plot is ridiculous come on a lost son in Iraq whos a criminal mastermind , an insane prophet father , the skin rotting disease and the intro with the cliche exploding cell phone who just happens to be the guy shes in love with . its like a bad episode of bones , the x-files , and csi all rolled into one .come on where is the real drama not this boring over hyped rehash we have seen so many times. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad acting, bad script, wanna be shocker TV. could have been a neat show if they would have paid some more money for actors and writers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not sure why it keeps getting such good reviews, from critics and viewers alike, because it really isn't a very good show. The writing and dialogue is terrible. The plots are absurd, and not in a good or interesting way. And the actors take themselves and their characters' roles way too seriously... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Like the X-Files. But stupider. Assuming of course its possible for ANY show to be stupider than the X-Files. The fact that cybernetics is referred to in the opening credits as a "fringe" science merely shows the scientific illiteracy of the people responsible for this dreck. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's no X-files. In the theme they say it's about: psychokinesis - teleportation - nanotechnology - artificial intelligence - precognition - dark matter cybernetics - suspended animation - artificial intelligence (again) This is what it really is: A plane full of people are infected and they die. A busload of people are gassed and they die. They'll run out of ideas for episodes soon cause they're aren't that many different kinds of mass transit. I'm guessing the next episode involves people on a train getting killed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is awful. It is more like a more gender balanced Pretty Little Liars or Gossip Girl than Archie. I hope nothing good happens to whoever came up with this crime against humanity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ick. Made by people who wanted to ape Arrested Development but didn't have the talent. Just nasty and forced. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

being different doesnt make it good. If you do not want to rely on good writers, at least do so in excellent improvisators and do something to set an environment where good improvs are gonna flow. This has nothing going on for it, except that it is different and it can thus attract all those that feel need to show the world how unique they are by praising whatever seems unique.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The premier got my attention. I love Sci-Fi, Halle Berry is starring in it, it must have something to it. Cool robot kid (rise of the machines kinda thing may happen), Aliens? that look like dead friends/relatives impregnating or otherwise probing people ( could be fun to watch ). But alas, all those good possibilities gone by episode 3 due to mediocre acting and same old-same old scripting. The acting is self explanatory as for the scripting it this that gets me. An astronaut comes back from space after a solo mission and it turns out shes preggers, but lets not tell anyone and she gets her government employed doctor to cover for her! Lets let the alien baby be a surprise for everybody. Also, I watch the tapes and now see that there was nobody there and I have some abnormality in my brain but I'm going to keep this a secret from the people that can help me because I'm curious to see where this goes. Hmmm...How about a little more realistic script where we see these people freak out. Almost everyone I know can't keep even the littlest secret yet most shows use this tired piece of you know what to....I don't know why they keep using it, its stupid. Anyway, enough of my ranting, the show lost me and I don't expect it to go very far. To bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

REALLY!

To predictable to obvious.  Acting not top notch.  Its going to take more than Halle to make this interesting to me. An unpredictable story line is a good start. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This started as a potentially exciting new series. Sci-Fi, mystery, thriller - good ingredients for a TV show. However, it suffers from a unbelievably slow plot line, terrible dialogue and the direction of the show feels lost.

There are many obvious plot holes which are never explained leaving the viewer wondering what's going on and deeply frustrated. The biggest one is why is her house not bugged?

The main character Molly unfortunately, is either being utterly naive or incredibly stupid for an astronaut to not realise what's going on around her and for some reason has giant balls of bravery when it comes to confronting armed people with machine guns and grenades with no more than her assertive voice protecting her.

The other main focus of the show is Molly's A.I. son, Ethan. Again, the intrigue is there but he's just very creepy and it feels like a retold story of 'Skynet' from the Terminator series.

The writers need to add some energy and rhythm to the series if it has a chance of surviving. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

At least the first season you could "see" despite the abuse of the camera shake, the night scenes of the second season are too dark!!! With my old plasma TV I can't see anything(and the camera shake abuse is still there). Netflix must add, as for pc games,  a MOVIE'S minimum requirements: hdtv contrast 50.000:1 or higher, a view of ten tenths or higher. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The female lead is horrid, the acting is worse, The mans wife is going to die and he acts like its a lunch break. I think this shows story could be compelling but the actors really are sub par. And why is the female lead always wearing a shirt where her shoulder is exposed. And in latter episode's  why does she have to keep pulling down her shirt to expose more skin? And someone please feed this woman a sandwich or chicken nuggets. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The series got off to such a great start, Caesar has a great actor and is a pleasure to watch and Octavian was interesting. All of the political intrigue was done quite well. The soldiers were carried along quite well, no problems. Then Caesar died and the whole series came crashing down
The two soldiers became a soap opera story and the series began to devote more and more time to their tiny tales of tiny people. The actually interesting part of the story, the intrigue, began to falter when Augustus Caesar was introduced. The actor just couldn't carry the man and he was no where near a replacement for Julius. Then they show the Egyptians as freeky deeky. I know they are a 3000 year old civilization by this stage but come on. Cleopatra is neither likable nor manipulative, at least in how the show portrays it. They simply say she is manipulative and cut to her getting what she wants, but as they say; the thrill is in the chase, never in the capture.
The faltering second season just soured the whole thing for me. It became so slow and monotonous, it was just unbearable, I had to skip most of the soldiers sections for being so irrelevant. I'm watching Rome here, I want to see the Senate and the great family's. I don't need the producers creating some plebeians to try and relate to me. I can relate to other human beings just fine thanks, I don't care what their social status is 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for this show, hoping for a lighter 'House of Cards' driven by Gary Trudeau's talent. Those hopes quickly crashed.
There were moments in this show that were good that were drowned in the larger cringe-worthy abyss. The scenes that featured Clark Johnson were often interesting and felt like they were realistic. John Goodman is capable of being very funny when he is well directed (Inside Llewyn Davis) but when he is not as in this show he's too over the top. The scenes involving Marc Consuelos and especially Matt Malloy were like actors trapped in a bad Saturday Night Live sketch.
The writing for this show is awful. There is little subtlety and little wit of a good Doonesbury comic strip, just cheap laughs and retread pokes at cardboard politicians, something even Doonesbury lapses into at times. The politicians happen to all be Republican, and as ThinkProgress points out, "One of the dullest decisions in the original pilot of Alpha House was to make all members of the house Republicans, and to make them all risible." But the bigger mistake is not to make the characters actual people. That doesn't mean they have to be likable (again, see Llweyn Davis), just flesh them out some.
If you're the kind of person who laughs at any joke that makes fun of Republicans or Conservatives is funny then this show might be for you, but if you're the kind of person who is empathetic to diverse viewpoints and appreciates intelligent comedy then don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched this last night and was impressed with the cast but the show stinks.  Amanda Peet is not a comedienne and that's a real problem since she's the start of this attempt at comedy.  The writing is awful and the plot makes no sense.Aside from the actual content, the show could be palatable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is incoherent and all over the place. The writers make stuff up as they go, and then, change without sticking to a static planned outline. This leads to improbabilities and inaccuracies all over the place. It is definitely not a realistic show in nearly any way, yet it is compelling, so people watch it. However, it is the worse show I have ever watched. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As someone else said, it's not boring.  I watch it but I don't like any of the characters including Annaliese.  I have little to no sympathy for any of them.  All of them are pretty despicable and lacking conscience, integrity or decency.  They are devoted to winning, but don't care at what cost to others or themselves.

There is a lot of music instead of dialogue, and not much character development.  The dialogue is iffy.  This seems to be a take off from "Murder in the First" which also lacked people with humanity and was a similar genre full of people with no humanity.  Perhaps it's really a vampire or dead-people story with "humans" replacing the vampires to pull people in. (Insert lawyer joke here).

I've watched every episode because there's something compelling--moth to a light.  But each time I watch, I go away feeling my soul has been dirtied and compromised. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It details the breaking down of young idealistic people into amoral, cynical and cutthroat individuals within the (fictional) legal defense world.   With a flawed, arrogant hedonist at the helm, the faithful students are heading to a point of no return upon which the flash-forwards constantly remind the viewer of their slippery slope.  Together with the completely unnecessary sex scenes and its narrow nihilistic theme, it is pretty distasteful and somewhat seedy viewing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There's a common saying that if you don't like it then don't watch. Basically a way to categorize critics away as haters. It would be possible to simply stop watching a series that was wholly, completely repulsive, but How To Get Away With Murder, like many such examples, carries some sparks of brilliance that keeps you hanging on.

I wanted to quit many times. The four main characters have nothing likable about them. I was hoping that that would be the point. That this would be the show about amoral people eventually digging their own grave. Sadly what we got was this mess.

And of course no review of How To Get Away With Murder can go on without mentioning the unnecessary gratuitous sex scenes that did nothing but repulse me.

The only real spark of this show was Annalise. Viola Davis creates an amazing character that is a great combination of strength and weakness that makes her believable. But, sadly, I couldn't recommend this show even for her.

And then of course there is the mystery. Till the end I was hoping this series would have a smart ending, something to blow you away. But all we got was a B grade ending of "you will never guess it was this character even though it makes no sense and feels like they made it up at the last minute".

In short I hold this series as trash and I have no desire to watch the second season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high expectations for this show, especially Viola Davis but was greatly disappointed with the first show. Viola was great and had an almost perfect depiction of her character. I found the show confusing with all the flashbacks and upset at her unnecessary implied attempted seduction of one of her students. As a married women, her having an affair added nothing to the show and was also unnecessary. Finally the gratuitous and unnecessary homosexual scene drove me further from the show At this time I am not sure I will bother watching the show again. Viola herself could carry the show to great heights but perhaps it is the writers that need to be changed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A legal world drama written by a teenage brain (or so it seems). The plots and twists were so bad that they one might be able to classify them as comedy, but unfortunately the show takes itself very seriously with mature themes aplenty. A lot of the side plots and story try to be engaging but the problem is that the characters are very badly developed defusing any sort of tension or build up that one might have if they can identify with any of the characters. For instance, by the end of season 1, I could care less about the lawyer/professor main character and it is clear as day that she is not bright nor worth following, but the show tries to play her off as some sort of brilliant lawyer. The writing does not fit the character description. Her choices during trial and in real life are, at best, about what I expect from a high school adolescent, not an adult. The students who follow her like puppies are equally frustrating in the same way that some tween drama are vomit inducing.

Overall this show is more about love triangles than anything else. If you are looking for an intellectual drama then skip this. If you enjoy trashy soap operas and dont particularly like to think, then this might be your kind of show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After hearing an onslaught of how "great" this show was, I decided to give it a chance. So I watched the first 2 seasons... I can't say I really want to continue with it. It's too cliche, unrealistic, and boring. Apparently the writers of this show have never heard of a "line-up", often times in the show they smash up entire stores, steal cars etc, meanwhile plenty of people are watching. Them having a one horse town police department in their pocket,isn't going to stop the justice system. Someone files an internal affairs complaint with that department I guarantee the feds would be swarming. The plot has no real direction, this gang blows up this gangs crap, and then they retaliate. There's no real rhyme or reason for the show just a bunch of wannabe thugs riding motorcycles. Ehh but everyone's entitled to their own opinion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very sad and disappointed by what this series has morphed into.  Are they caving to certain interest groups?  Do they feel the need to take on what they don't understand (but think they do) about the 2016 election?  Most people don't have a problem with reflection on the murky work of counter terrorism, and finding a policy that is effective.  But the notion that an Alex Jones like character is working with the CIA is truly preposterous.  This was once a great show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Nightly Show is just bad.  His humor is relatively childish.  He tries to make his show like a news show and unbiased when in reality he is an anti-police leftist.  All of his stories are on the "victimization" of African-Americans.  It is reverse racist like Keuy and Peele and the Daily Show, only not funny like those shows. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Used to love this show and have always loved Larry Wilmore yet as the series has gone on the show has become more and more unreasoning "Social Justice Warrior" blocking its ears to truth in the name of sustaining outrage at supposed racial slights.

Racism is a huge problem and perhaps this show has a valid place in shining a light on it that takes it too far the other way, but it is increasingly getting painful to watch. I'd give the previous episodes 8/10 but the last 10 to 20 a 1 or 2.

Larry Fillmore your show should be the polar opposite of Fox News (intelligent, wise & truthful) not its mirror with protagonists swapped. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The entire setup comes across as awkward. Larry Wilmore is at his best with race humor, but he goes overboard and often misses the mark, sometimes cringingly so. Plus, his non-race humor tends to be strained or flat. The panel is a mess and adds little to the show. I gave it time to find its feet, but it still hasn't. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I tried to watch this, but can't, it's to awful.  The show is not nearly as funny as Colbert was.  With Stewart now leaving, Comedy Central is in big trouble. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is the same old stuff with this man pulling the race card out at every chance.  He is not funny and he is frankly boring.  Same old the black man is being taken down bull.. he needs to go away 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Larry Wilmore wasn't funny on the daily show and he isn't funny on his own show.  I enjoy the Daily Show, Bill Maher's show and generally any other political / societal satirical shows... Larry's show simply isn't funny.

- Larry's delivery is muddled and generally off queue.  That nervous laugh of his in between bits is annoying and distracting.
- His material is 99% one-sided, which I think is a turn-off for many.  Much of Stewart's credibility comes from his willingness to poke at hypocrisy/injustice, no matter where it comes from.  Larry won't poke at issues that are 'generally' supported by his political/societal views (or he does it very poorly).
- Discussions related to race inequality in this country are very important and relevant for satirical show like Larry's; however, it seems like 80% of the shows are dedicated to this topic alone and for people seeking a comedy show it gets old (from a comedy television show perspective).

Bottom line is Larry's jokes are forced and hardly funny, the show is too short for the format they're trying to execute, and Larry's delivery is simply poor.  I think his cause is solid and I want to see him succeed, but I feel there is too much of an uphill battle for Larry to be successful.

* I noticed that many of the user reviews are one time posters.  I think it says something when someone's show is so disliked that it is moving people to open an account on metacrtic just to voice how much they dislike the show.  That includes myself. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The potential for this show is utterly is utterly wasted on one-sided extreme leftist crap.  The host thinks he knows everything.  There's absolutely no nuance and their "diverse" panels usually have at least four black people.  Larry plays a full deck of race cards every show and it's frankly getting old.  I've watched almost every episode since the first  and I find myself more annoyed every week.  His rhetoric gets so ridiculous that its borderline anti-white.  Even more absurd is his hatred and misunderstanding of the American South.
Recently, the show provided a perfectly concise example of everything wrong.  In a skit, Larry and four of his contributors posed as a handful of heavily caricatured South Carolina state senators having a meeting about when to plan the discussion of when to talk about taking the Confederate flag down.  Among these four caricatured white senators (some in whiteface oddly enough) was one black senator who had the only trace of intelligence in the entire group and was shut down by his white colleagues (out of implied racist intent).  In the skit, the group decided to meet to discuss when to plan the discussion of taking the flag down in 9 months.  In reality, the Republican controlled South Carolina house and senate successfully voted (with a supermajoirty) to take it down only three weeks after the disaster.
In short, this show is full of crap.  I love Key and Peele, Colbert, and Jon Stewart, and I really wanted to like Larry Wilmore, but I simply cannot.  At first I thought that his material would improve over time but it's only become worse and after four nights a week and so many weeks later this show needs to be put out of its misery.  Like so many other people, I created this account just to write this review. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to give the show a chance and got into it at first, but the racial topics quickly grew tiresome.
It would've worked for a few episodes, but EVERY NIGHT......ughhh.....it gets old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show had promise until they started making everything about race. Yes there are racial issues in the country but everything isn't about race. They blow it up to such proportion that I just don't care to watch it.  I get pissed when hulu auto plays to it like I used to get pissed when it played Late Night with Seth Meyers.  I don't want to watch this drivel. I liked the format of having multiple guests. Some times they cover some really important issues and can do them rather well. However, they piss me off enough that I rarely want to watch it. I miss Colbert.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe what a generous score the critics reviews accumulated but this show completely missed the mark of what could have been a great opportunity for comedy and the black perspective on current events. It is not funny. It is childish. So disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I find this show beating a dead horse "race". Even the funniest people couldn't sit there for 20+ minutes a day using the main focal point of race to make it funny. I will say I have giggled or chuckled at times from one little skit or so but overall if all it gives me is race...I will just move on to a new show, it just doesn't cut it when I'm finding O'rielly Factor more entertaining than TNS anymore. I say they need to redo the focal points or it will sink like a stone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing like most of King's adaptations. James Franco is miscast as Jake, the story feels extremely rushed, and it deviates from King's novel so much that it turns a somber meditation on the ills of America over the last 50 years to a Back to the Future remake. If you're going to change a novel (like Kubrick did with the Shining) --by all means create your own art--but don't minimize it by making a joke out of it. Awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first season was great. I really enjoyed it. Now, season 2 is disaster. It's disgusting, grouse and there are practically nothing to laugh about. I was so excited that Detour got renewed, but now i'm so disappointed and i'm not gonna continue watching. Such a pity. :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Interesting but need to filter profanity!! Would make it a better program & don't have to worry about my Granddaughter hearing this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Would be great except for Profanity. The profanity does NOT improve the show at all. Would have given it a much higher rating if it wasn't for the foul language. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show started as an original funny comedy. Then it just became repetitive and annoying.
It's not funny anymore, and I don't get how can people still watch this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Others have said it before. The actors are reading lines they dont believe is funny. It's really bad writing. I think the actors on the show can do a lot better than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow I can't believe they're still making Friends knockoffs, Well it's been a while so I guess it was only a matter of time until a Friends ripoff finally became a hit. Staring people from Saved by the Bell: the New class nonetheless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

the show is clever, but the jokes are stale. they repeat the same remarks as if they had not heard of any other jokes to tell. the first episode it had the same lame joke told more than once . 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where did the horror go in this season of AHS? It is not scary, creepy or unsettling one bit. There is not even any sick or twisted humor like in the previous seasons. Even the sex stuff which is suppose to be shocking is lame and tame. The plot-lines were tired and predictable. The dialogue made a joke out of great acting. I could not take Elsa or Dandy serious for one second. And someone thought they were Baz Lurhmann this season, having the characters burst into modern song all of a sudden. But while Baz is a master at his craft, this felt like I was watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show minus any wink to the audience. The best part of this whole season was the opening credits, and yes I watched til the final episode just hoping something redeeming would happen. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

American horror story.... yeah right more like American gross out story. There are 5 things that define this series

1. Portray women as perfect beings and if they aren't perfect it's probably because of a guy.
2. Demonize (white) men every chance it gets
3. Make up the story as they go along
4. Social justice warriors
5. No horror what so ever unless killing someone with your genitals counts as horror these days.

First season was all about the guy who cheated on his wife and tried to make up for it the entire season, while his wife is portrayed as the perfect woman who didn't do anything wrong. And of course the white male psychopath who did a school shooting.

Second season already showed their horrible writing, and they really had no idea what the end goal was. Of course as in season 1, you have the male psychopath who enjoyed killing women this time, why can't it be a female psychopath? Oh that's right females can't  be psychopaths only white men are capable of becoming one.
1 male actor was a "good" guy who was surrounded by female do gooders. starting to see a trend here?
As their sjw crusade continues naturally they turned this season all about lesbians.

3rd season was a complete cluster of bad plots. What really grinned my gears was that all men were servants of women they didn't even try to hide it, that it is a feminist show this time. It starts off with a drunk spoiled brat who got "raped" by a rugby team and got butthurt over it, and thought the perfect  punishment was to kill them all by exploding their bus, cause of course "rape" is worse than death by feminists. as in season 2 there was one good boy who didn't rape her and because he died in the bus explosion, they turned him into a Frankenstein creature, who basically was the witches loyal dog the entire series. then you have the male white butler who is  naturally a psychopath. In this season the sjw theme was racism and feminism.

fourth season I couldn't even endure to watch the entire first episode. The cliches are present once again. I can already see the sjw trend, that you need to accept ANYONE no matter how moronic they act or look except for white people of course who are naturally psychopaths like the clown this time. Once again the same male actor who is the good guy, surrounded by the SAME female actors who's acting starts to feel forced. The music was annoying and badly edited I couldn't even hear the actor voices because the music was playing the entire episode.   The badly done erotic scenes were just cringe worthy,

This tv show is sjw propaganda at it's finest. if they truly were pro diversity they wouldn't make the same cliches over and over again. This show is racist towards white people and abuse every stereotype towards white men. while promoting sjw every chance it gets.

I give it a two because I enjoyed season 1 somewhat until i realized what the tv show was really all about. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No one does nighttime soaps better than ABC, especially anything attached to Shondaland..  Empire feels more like a throwback to Dynasty and the original Dallas with cliched characters and story, at least in its pilot episode.  The show need more than bling to make it watchable 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show was supposed to be funny? Unbelievable and terrible premise. How else can we glamorize crime. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How dumb! My wife and I watched the first episode and were thinking, this is funny? I can possibly see that the British version was good, but the Americanized version is just dumb. Can American producers not come up with there own ideas for shows? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another attempt to humanize animals . PETA action? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Show doesn't capture the spirit of the woman, or the times. Trying too hard to be Emmy/Globe material; Kate sleepwalks through the role, bakes a few pies and then--Presto!--opens a spiffy new restaurant in the midst of The Great Depression. She sleeps with Wally The Pig without batting an eyelash but can't bring herself to work as common waitress--all the while maintaining a very comfortable middle-class home without benefit of alimony. This screenplay lacks the snap of the thirties, when everyone had to hustle at top speed to stay alive. For a more honest and satisfying depiction of the real early '30s, I suggest you watch a few classic episodes of "Our Gang" featuring Chubby, Stymie, Jackie Cooper and "Miss Crabtree." You'll get all the authentic costumes you desire, but more importantly, authentic period soul. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Garbage, cliched poorly acted poor dialog drivel...typical network tv cop drama, no brains and all flash.....realism Ha!!! what are these critics watching, further evidence that the world will never see cop shows as good as Homicide, Law and Order and the WIRE ever again....HBO is reshowing the WIRE if you haven't seen then watch it, that's a real cop show not this garbage! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a nightmare.  I have to admit first up that Mindy Kaling is my least favourite character from The Office, so it was always going to be a struggle enjoying this show.  That being said, it's positively awful....cheesy tripe that will probably appeal to a demographic far, far removed from my own. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Before this show aired, the critics told us it will be the best show of the season. Not even close.  It flops on many levels. It fails to give us a central sense of place or a rounded out ensamble.  It was all about mindy and how sad and desperate she is.  To be a success, a show has to have more than one central character that you want to come back and get to know more.  This show did none of that.  I disliked the men in her life and the girls around Mindy were all nodescript models. The two walk on celebrities are clearly not going to be around to keep this show afloat. Above all, it was hard to like the character of Mindy.  I am going to have to force myself to watch more episodes in hopes they reboot it.  But the worst sin this show committed was that it simply was not funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I guess my age is showing.  I found the first half hour to be juvenile with only a few moments of fun.  We all know that Saturday Night Live skits have a tendency to run on and on past the expiration point of their laughs.  Six half hours of this show?   That's at least a whole month of Saturday Night Lives. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Who has the patience to slog through this? Who cares? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for the show, and yet could only think of how it would follow in the foorsteps of every show that had been their and done it before.

With the same mystery plot, intregue, conspirancies that we have seen countless times before from Dean Koontz,Tom Clancy, Stephen King and James Patterson or from shows such as LOST ( god what a waste of space ), First Edition, John Doe ( yet another cancelled show leaving you hanging ) or even the X Files Rubicon does no more to the genre or TV than fill time until the rating season comes back.

The more I watch the more I see it sink into an excuse to get out of the house and take the dog for a walk. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the entire show and never laughed once and I tend to laugh at everything. There is humor here but it is diluted by the premise that Community colleges are for losers that can't for whatever reason go to a regular university. This is a disservice to many people for whom community colleges are a more affordable way to higher education. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Joel McHale but this show is absolutely horrible. Not funny, bad writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Trying to do way too much in any single episode. It is not as subtle as the Office and not nearly as quick witted as 30 Rock. It will probably be canceled soon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

McHale is the only thing good abou the show. The writing is so stupid. Flushed after 2 1/2 episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its not funny. The story makes no sense; I am not sure how they have come to look to McHale's character for for guidance. Maybe thats the joke but I just don't get it. The characters have no chemistry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Community, created in 2009 as an addition to NBC's Thursday comedy night, is a completely unnecessary addition to new TV programing. First off, the concept of the show is incredibly boring. While trying to follow increasingly popular "workplace comedy" mold, the creators of the show stumbled upon the idea of a community college, where everyone is a total loser. This could be seen as "fresh" or "creative," but really it just feels sloppy.In addition to the premise of the show being dull, the individual episodes are daft and unappealing. Each episode follows the exact same plot line as the previous one; the characters will find their way into an (at first seemingly appealing) problem, which is then overplayed throughout the episode, and finally concluded when Joel McHale makes a shrewd yet meaningless speech about the rest of the character's problems.Unfortunately, the main issue with the show is neither the concept or the episode's plot lines. It is simply the characters. Each cast member and the character they portray is unlikable in their own individual way. The writers of the show obviously thought it would be clever to form a group of losers lead by one  incredibly egocentric individual. Unfortunately, Joel McHale's character (Jeff Winger) is not charming, or even somewhat intelligent and, instead, comes off as snide and narcissistic. The rest of the cast is even less enjoyable; Gillian Jacobs (Britta Perry) is much too irritable, Alison Brie (Annie Edison) is astonishingly annoying to listen to, Danny Pudi (Abed Nadir) is painstakingly overplayed, Donald Glover (Troy Barnes) has almost no personality whatsoever, Yvette Nicole Brown (Shirley Bennett) has a humor that gets old very quickly, and Chevy Chase (Pierce Hawthorne) is utterly unnecessary and was clearly only put on the show for his name in the credits. As a group, the ensemble of characters make up a very unlikable cast.In conclusion, the fans of Community are mistaking the show's flaws for it being "off the wall." Actually, the show is really just made up of a group of unfunny writers who think that they're much smarter than they actually are and a mismatched cast that can't get enough of themselves. Community attempts to copy 30 Rock's absurd hit-or-miss concept, but unfortunately it's hits are much outweighed by it's misses.

"Colony" has the look and feel of a mystery-drama from the '90s. And if that's not bad enough, it's a hodge-podge of mysteries you've seen since then: X-Files, Fallen Skies, Dark Skies, Firefly, The Event, Jericho, V, the horrid Terra Nova, and why not plagiarize the Wall from the Divergent Series of movies, or Aeon Flux. And it's family-friendly, ugh, so everyone in your stereotypical household will find a character to identify with. And it stars executive producer Josh Holloway, who everyone keeps mistaking for his character "Sawyer" in "LOST". People, you loved "Sawyer", not Josh. And let's not forget that series creator Carlton Cuse was half the creative team behind the disappointment that was "LOST", so has his 5-yr exile been long enough? Do we trust him again? No, because of everything written to this point. I'll not waste my view-time with this seen-it-done-it excuse for a series. Thank gahd "Blacklist" has returned, and "Suits" (also a USA property) returns on 1/27. Also during Colony's time slot you can find "Portlandia", "London Spy" (new on BBCA), and "Baskets" (new on FX), any of which you'll find your viewing time better spent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the pilot hoping for a decent new series with potential, however I was disappointed that the writers fell back on crude profanity-laced conversation in an attempt to give the show some edginess--that's a cheap alternative to good writing. The main character also seems to pretty closely follow the profile of hedge fund King, Steven Cohen, right down to Cohen's purchase of a Hamptons megalith (mansion) a couple years ago for $60 million -- that also occurred during a government investigation of Cohen -- in fact, as the show continued I got the increasing sense that the plot had simply been lifted from a stale NY Post article. To try to disguise the main hedge fund personality, the writers tried to add an amalgam of a few other Wall Street personalities to their main character, including Howard Lutnick of Cantor Fitzgerald. Not particularly subtle, and also falling somewhat flat. I did however smile at the cameo by David Faber who seems to fawn over "Stevie" in real life -- not sure if he realized this show wouldn't shed a particularly kind light on the hedge fund King. In general, it becomes clear that the show does not intend to portray 'real people' from the hedge fund industry but rather the warped cartoonish figures that come from Hollywood minds that think anything connected with capitalism must be evil. It's a shame, I'm disappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show has really gone downhill from the original first two seasons. Instead of a show about community college it has become a ridiculous sequence of events devoid of any plausibility. So all the moments that would be shocking or awkward aren't very funny because no one in the show is level enough to make those moments seem ridiculous. There has been no character development at all and the relationships and interactions between all the characters has remained the same. To sum it up the show has become very impersonal and only seeks to one-up itself in its own absurdity. It lacks any long term growth and it will be depressing to see them stretch this show to the six seasons and a movie that they want, without significant changes to show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was initially interested to see what the show might be like, because I thought that my own knowledge of Islam was somewhat lacking. However, even with my poor knowledge of Muslims, I know that this is NOT what normal Muslims are like, and the actions taken by some of the characters in this series feel exaggerated. Maybe it's just the TLC pedigree, but nothing about this show feels genuine to me. It feels more like a Muslim instructional video than an actual reality series, if the term "reality" even denotes anything real anymore. I walked away from All-American Muslim feeling frustrated and even a bit embarrassed. And if a Protestant Christian is getting embarrassed by the misrepresentation of Muslims, you know that your series has failed to do its intended purpose. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Weeds is bad series with full off discretion of young people who dont know that you are not cool if you use weeds. Nice acting, so I didnt give 0, but 2. But it is no story at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love a good horror movie as well as the next but this is just not good gru.  This show lacks any sense of humor or empathy.  The writing is putrid and the graphics are disturbing without any redemption.  Having watched the third episode I cancelled my season pass and moved on.  When they leave a serial killer's daughter alone in her house, even though, she may have been involved in the murders, I threw up my hands.  A suspect left alone to kill another suspect and then gets recruited by Hannibal who has time to hide the body while a crap load of cops are outside...oh yeah somehow he gets a bump on the head.....dreadful dreck!  The dialogue and acting is god-awful.  Oh, and the constant "eerie" soundtrack to set the mood is mind-numbing.  This show is NBC's version of "Monk" meets "Criminal Minds"...feh! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The actors are all top notch. The concept is extremely intriguing.  The actual writing and direction are horrible. Execution is everything and they manage to blow it by a mile.  I'll watch one more but if the next episode stays as muddled as the first one.....sayanara. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is to Homeland what CSI is to the Wire.

So I guess it'll probably do pretty well.

I'm guessing the actors were told to act like its 90210 or one tree hill. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow! I am STUNNED by the positive reviews this show has received. I was looking for something to watch last night and saw Quantico got a score of 70. WTF -- this show was garbage. It's low rate, convoluted story,
and just typical bad network tv.  This show will NOT make it past season 1. If i'm wrong, I'll retract this comment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Implausible, dysfunctional, and brought to prime time for?.... the lead is poorly cast but quite frankly the show should be relegated to the trash heap! A 2 just for all the pretty people.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show falls into the CSI Cyber camp of being so bad its almost entertaining. Laughably cliched characters that came from a cookie cutter writers room note book. The gay kid, the hot Muslim, the attractive rich girl most of them are so stupid they would barely be accepted into a community college let alone Quantico. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How to make fun of the FBI again, I can't understand the good critics it got. Surely it's explosive and has twists but the plot is poor, the writing and the acting too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quantico squandered a promising start. The early episodes established distinctive characters within the large ensemble cast, and hinted at a long and potentially interesting story arc. Sadly by episode 4 this had been discarded in favour of histrionics, gimmicks and melodrama. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Possibly the most horrendous TV series I've ever had the misfortune of accidentally putting on.  Shallow, unoriginal and riddled with cliches.  If you want to lose some brain cells, tune in by all means.  For anyone to mention Homeland in relation to this is a crime against humanity.  Homeland is absolutely superb in pretty much every aspect - This is world class garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Decent premiere for a mainstream network show, but Priyanka Chopra is a really weak link. If only they'd picked a stronger lead, based on acting ability rather than marketing appeal. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I created an account so that I could write a little about this show.
It is absolutely awful. I could not even get to evaluating the plot because of how distractingly bad the rest of the writing is. I don't think I have ever heard worse banter between characters. They all sound like they have sticks up their ass, in a way that I cannot help but think the writers did not intend. And to all those people saying this show has a PC agenda: if it does, it is wholly failing to carry it out. Characters often reference lots of things that are PC in ways that are over the top, insensitive, and sound ridiculous; certainly not PC, but it really does seem that the writers are actually trying to make their characters come off as aware and PC: Not working, writers.
I hope the writers of this show stop writing it immediately. The characters are attractive, so that is nice, and it might have a plot that could be entertaining but not original if the rest of the writing (and acting) wasn't so bad, but that's about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I want so much too like this show but it is absolutely infested with liberal cliche. The last dreadful episode I saw was a pitiful morality play on torture hoping I will sob boo-hoo for the terrorists held at Abu Graib and Guantanamo. Please, drop the sanctimonious moralizing and focus on the action-adventure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this series, but couldn't even make it through a whole episode. I was bored and the clumsy cliches didn't help either. I grant that it may be difficult to be groundbreaking when you are telling a story that has been told before. But if you aren't going to turn a story on its head, you need extraordinarily charismatic actors and wickedly clever writing to keep things interesting. This series has neither of those things. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wish all the best to Neil Flynn, but I'm not a Patricia Heaton fan. Besides, I think Jane Kaczmarek and Brian Cranston were much better in the roles, I'm not sure why they were replaced. I don't know why they turned Malcom into such a jerk, but having a girl take over for Reese could be a cleaver idea. The little kid who plays Dewey is the highlight of this all too self aware, over-the-top, rip off. (Note to the directors: extreme close-ups of goofy faces at weird angles do not make for a fun viewing experience). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I finally gave up on The Path eight episodes into the first season when it became apparent that the show is going nowhere fast.

Aaron Paul must be ruing the day he signed on to star in and produce this turd. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Severely boring. So far the first three episodes have been nothing but build up. The premise is pretty weak to begin with. The whole "situation" they are in could easily be corrected by simply killing the bad guy. Hes got no backup , hes all peaceful and trusting like, and hes probably the least ominous antagonist Ive ever seen in a show. Could literally walk up to him in the show and just end him. Not to mention that cults are becoming a thing of the past as people realize that anything that has to do with faith or religion is a scam. The ONLY saving grace this show has is from the lead actor (who was in breaking bad), who plays his role well, what role there is. ultimately so far its not been worth the time it took to watch it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Because I generally enjoy British TV and because I like sci-fi, I gave Dr. Who a try. It's been on since the early 60s (with a hiatus in the middle) and has over 1,000 episodes. So it has to have SOMETHING going for it, right? Turns out, the answer is no. I tried three times. Couldn't get through an entire episode. It's so ridiculous and so internally inconsistent, it's a joke, a joke that's not funny. I should mention I've watched the current version of Dr. Who (or until 2014 he was current; now a new older Dr. Who has replaced him). I also saw one of the old episodes from the early 80s or maybe 70s. Back then it was super low budget. But like the current version, a hodgepodge of meaningless nonsense. The pace is frantic, as if they believe by barreling along the viewer won't notice the plot holes here, there, and everywhere. It is strictly for children, probably starting at about the age they become too old for Teletubbies. This is coming from a guy who appreciates Star Trek and the rebooted Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and a variety of sci-fi flicks. So I am definitely not against the genre. It's just that Dr. Who stinks. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was, perhaps, one of the worst pilots I saw during the Amazon pilot season it premiered. I am mystified as to why it was picked up for a full season. I saw the first two episodes, and it doesn't get any better. This is a misfire for Amazon. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Blue blood, season 1, omg where do i start, tom selleck should be playing the country cop who uses a baseball bat to combat crime,

donny wolberrg is believable enough in the cop role as usual, his character does not seem to stay much, which is a shame for his acting ability, but this tv series is like a remake of an ole show
gone bad, come on.... the whole family is running the show, one is being investigated by the DA sure
enough the next kid will be as well, and that puts the assisant DA in the middle when suddenly tom's
role will be investigating his daughter the assiatant DA, right?  One by one each family member will be part of an investigation, and there will always be some tension about the son who died in uniform,
tsk tsk, writers are hired too young these days and forgot what we have already seen on the tube or in the movies,

the best part of this episode is frank sinatra or harry connick jr singing New York New york, i can never tell the difference between the two,

sorry ole chap but i cant give you any kudo;'s for this role, it is just not believable enuf, your family is getting in our face, and i think we deserve more than that, i can only rate this new series a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Blue Bloods remind me of Quincy, Everyone is happy at the beginning, angry in the middle and all sat laughing round the dinner table at the end. I'm sure most people will look back at this tv show in the future and say to themselves " did I really watch that rubbish " 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you enjoy this show, do us all a favour and walk into your garage, close the door and window(s), turn on your car, and start jogging on the spot.  This show is the entertainment equivalent of a lobotomy by way of enema. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to the new season of Falling Skies for months now.  I really tried to get enjoy the first two episodes.  So far it has been a disappointment to me.  Nothing I have seen so far has been able to keep my interest.  They are spending too much time in the prison area and it's always dark and dingy looking.  I think in the first episode that was ok.  Now it is dragging on into the 2nd episode.  You would think they had a shortage on lighting while filming.  Yawn.........
I really really want it to get better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow - could the mainstream critics be more up the arse of Speilberg?  Because that's the only way to make sense of the discrepancy between them and the user scores.  This was the most disappointing and boring pilot I've seen in a long time.  Everything about it just seemed to strike the wrong note.  The premise makes little sense-  as others have mentioned, what alien species that could take over the planet then doesn't finish the job?  And having Noah Wylie walking around talking about the numerous times in history during which small groups of people fought off a larger enemy seemed utterly desperate.  And it was SAPPY too.  The acting was poor and even some of the casting was pretty crap.  (that guy that is leading their unit- he plays the same guy in every show he's in and they are always really annoying) You don't really see much alien action and what action you do see is often in a darkened atmosphere so they can get away with CGI sloppiness.  The alien design has been stolen too.. I can't remember from what other show or movie, but I've definitely seen those before.  Very rarely do I give up on a show that I was interested in after only one episode but I feel justified in it on this one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Turgid, ill-thought out, cloyingly sentimental: all the things Spielberg now stands for. Could it be rescued by dramatic revelations? I doubt it: the plodding acting, writing and directing aren't up to it. Only the creature animation is adequate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As of now this show is just above terrible.  I wanted to like it.  I'm still trying to like it but the direction is really bad, the actors should be ashamed.  V was way better and BSG put this to shame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hadn't realized it was done by Spielberg until i started writing this. Doesn't look like he has moved on much from ET. I was trying to stay with it , in the hope it may be get better, but when the kid runs after a dog i had to turn it off. Its nonsense stuff. Its boring and it has the suspense of  melting ice. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Falling Skies has an interesting and creative premise. Too bad the execution is so, well, stupid. The army officers do not follow army protocol, they do not know exhibit any army or common sensical expertise, much less how to set up a perimeter, and treat the civilians like dogs. Really Spielberg? Really?Is this supposed to be great TV?The silliness extends everywhere in every episode. These people are supposed to be fighting for their lives. Losing the doctor was a horror show of stupidity and unrealistic drama. Can't there at least be one smart guy in the room, or this just in general bad writing?Good lord. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I should know by now to expect a Spielberg sci-fi show to be full of bad-acting kids, bad science, marginal special effects, and sappy dialogue.  In fact, I think Spielberg ruined "Super 8" as well along these lines.  (Abrams, you did fine with Cloverfield, you DON"T NEED SPIELBERG!)Take Battlestar Galactica (new) (yes, we have Cylons and Baltar on land), merge with Robert Heinlein's "The Puppet Masters", add kiddies, remove all good actors/acting, water down the violence and drama, and slash the budget.  And throw in the name of a former director has-been who was relevant 35 years ago.This should have been made by Joss Whedon if you wanted a great series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Interesting concept sunk by cliche after cliche. After 2 hours of cliched dialouge and character 'development' I couldn't stand it anymore. The only thing impressive about this show is the production values, and even then only some of the CGI shots look good. In the first 30 minutes we see a huge group of humans traveling slowly, in daytime, and in a town. What the hell? Why aren't they being attacked by the 'hundreds' of aircraft that the aliens have in their mothership which is only several miles away? Look, I'm not one to nitpick but how am I supposed to be scared of aliens that can't find hundreds of people in the middle of the day? And they have aircraft for crying out loud! The characters don't seem like they're taking the whole thing seriously. Everyone is acting like this whole alien invasion thing is just an inconvenience as they spout off 'witty' one-liners and cliched emotional dialouge that we've all heard before. The lead actor is the only person who seems like he's trying to deliver his lines with any amount of emotion. The child characters feel shoe-horned in and are mostly annoying. To be fair, it's only the first episode. But it'll take some serious effort for this show to find it's footing and get better. Compared to all the gold that's on TV right now, this show is a serious letdown. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Time is the most important thing we have. It's worth more than money, worth more than fame, worth more than status or position. I write this review so that you might save some of your precious time by not watching the show Falling Skies. I was unable to feel even a small shred of sympathy toward these characters. You know that feeling you get when you are watching a TV show and you forget its a TV show because you are so into it..? This will not be an experience like that, you wont spend any time  being immersed in the character's plight, hoping for small miracles, and generally caring how things turn out. You are so reminded that this is a poorly made TV show that you begin to wish the aliens finish them off because if this is a cross section of what is left of humanity, wow, humanity is really in trouble. Someone else here mentions about the kid running after the dog...yes, I too felt a tinge of 'why'...no wait.. it was more like 'why me?' and 'I knew this was never going to get any better!!'  Any review that seems to sway you toward a favorable opinion of this fiasco must be taken note of so you can ensure that you never listen to that critic again. I ranked it low, but not the lowest as I did chuckle once during an exchange between Noah and the A-Team fella...something about " you dont need to agree with me you just need to listen!" or something like that. His response was fast, and witty, and I grinned. Anyway, that is in no way a redemption statement. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very, very generic, cliche'd and they even have stereo typical black guys. So white folk can feel good that black people having been included! Yay! There's also 1 Asian, yay!  Beside the racial quota filling in generic ethnic roles that Caucasian's aren't allowed to portray.. It's all family **** and not what I expected.. I hope the aliens win.  The Walking Dead is 110% more realistically written. Which was what I was hoping for... An alien invasion version of The Walking Dead.  I felt like I needed to strap a bow tie to my hair, put on a pink dress and suck a lollipop by the end of this show.  Here's the math... Generic+Stereo typing+Idiocy+Family+Family Dog+Aliens+Ugly people all dead+Doc Carter= Falling Skies..  Sesame Street is more hardcore.I was really looking forward to this show..  For people that want a less sillier review... I'll grant you one.This series is aimed towards a family audience and when you do that.. There are about 50% of scenarios and language that you cannot use.  Realism cannot be successfully portrayed here.The characters are generic and nobody is outstanding. The acting is ok but clearly everybody seems to have graduated from day time TV acting school. Even Will Patton is average and this guy was great. Noah Wyle is just Noah Wyle.. the rest you can take it or leave it..Judging from the pilot, I doubt we will see much alien activity as the show will aim towards the usual "we are the our own worst enemy" type of story.... To save on budget I guess.  I agree we are our worst enemy but it would be nice to see something different.  Just about everything on this show is too predictable and clumsy. Top it up with average writing and acting, then Falling Skies will not last long at all.I'll watch it all though due to fact it's still going to better than all the cop shows, hospital and law dramas out there.  Though if it doesn't improve I will have to abandon it.  It's not looking good because the pilot is where most most of the money is spent and where some of the best stuff is written before they run out of steam. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can really get into why Falling Skies truly came up short in its premiere--I decided to just let it progress on its own slow decline in viewership. I truly was hoping for "more" considering Spielberg was tied to the series. The show did not present enough for me to be concerned for any of the survivors. The concept overall wasn't remotely logical. Predictable. Forgettable. Done 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadful is the operative word here. The series is replete with so much graphic, unnecessary sex scenes and gratuitous violence and gore, and animal cruelty, that the content and storyline is overpowered. It could have otherwise been an engrossing  thriller.  It is really a shame.  Also, the directing could have matched noirish mood better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like it, watched first two weeks. This show needs to be put out of it's misery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After watching two season's worth of Strike Back I was really hoping Hunted would be good. It's not. It drags along for most of every episode, with fake as hell interactions between the characters, and when the action finally arrives it's completely unbelievable. What we have here is yet another case of "girl beats up guy" and, as always, it's totally unbelievable. I'm all for suspension of disblelief but this is too much. If they want to have a female, any female, be a badass they should have her be one with her brains. I'm sorry but Sam, the main character, couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag.

If you want to see an awesome female protagonist watch Homeland, not this crap... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've stayed away from Torchwood since I finished season 3, I wasn't a fan at the end of it.
So I finally come back to Miracle Day. And I have to wonder to myself where the mentality of people go.
A current User Score of 6.3 is way too high for this mind numbingly bad idea.
Notice there, I said "IDEA", because if you think about the premise of Miracle Day, it doesn't matter about anything they say matters, because people can't die.
If people can't die, then there's nothing anyone needs to worry about. And neither does anything else that's said, diseases - the only reason we fear diseases is because we would die if we contracted a deadly one. And we can't die because of "The Miracle" Then there's the food. Why do people need food? To continue living.
That's out the window then, isn't it? Yes, we'd end up as stick thin skeletons with a tiny skin sack around it, but that doesn't change anything.

That's the problem with this series. The initial premise "sounds" cool, but lacks anything beyond that.
Take Season 1, the premise is a rag-tag band of guerrilla fighters protect the world from alien threats that slip through the net. Tell me why season one should fit that mark? Because other than Day One (and that is a VERY tight squeeze to fit it) the stories are lame, sexed up versions of BAD Dr Who Episodes.
Season 2, the premise is to learn more about Jack's past as Time Agent. Do we? Not really, we get some lame and pitiable character development and death within the same series smacks of "Well, we don't know what to do with them, kill 'em."
That might sound hard but it's the truth, building up the stories of Tosh and Owen and then suddenly killing them off shows lack of respect with both their characters, a lack of respect for the fans and a lack of respect for the writing involved.
Children of Earth could have been a turning point, it wasn't great but it showed a marked improvement over the terrible characterisation and bad writing of the previous two seasons. But then came Miracle Day.

With anything that Russell T Davies has produced in this vein, there's other things given and shoved in our faces than a fantastical story that should be the main focus.
While with Torchwood and Who, he injects a form of social satire into it, the constant and stupid news reports with talking heads, I sometimes think he read too much Frank Miller and loved the talking heads in TDKR.
But the worst part about Torchwood is the over-saturated Sex in it. I don't mind my Whovian world being mixed with a raunchy scene here or there. Just like the cheesecake I occasionally eat.
But I don't have it for every meal and not in Super Sized amounts either.
I don't have issue with the gay and lesbian relationships in the Torchwood story, I applaud the fact that gay relationships are being shown on TV, but if you want to do so much sex with any gender, don't set it in a Sci-Fi Show, create a drama where sex is a major feature in it. A Sci-fi show can have sexiness in it sure, we can even have sex as a feature in it. Just understand that the target demographic of this genre is going to want to see sci-fi stuff as the major feature, sure the sex is always going to be appealing, but we like the aliens and ray guns and spaceships and monsters and everything to do with the freaking genre too!

Torchwood was a bold attempt to make a Darker and more dangerous style of sci-fi and to do it with Who as well, I think it could have worked with a better creative staff.
It's gone now, and should really stay that way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Being a die-hard Torchwood fan, I had rather high expectations for this fourth series. Unfortunately, there were entirely too many different writers...not to mention double the number of needed episodes to portray such positively atrocious writing. Mr. Davies completely tossed out three years of established canon and I was left more than a wee bit disappointed. There were a few bright spots, but on the whole, they were few and far between.

Personally, I'd recommend fans who've been there from the beginning of series 1 to give this Americanised version a pass. Stick with what Torchwood is supposed to be: Wales, the Hub and Captain Jack Harkness. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is cliched and shallow. It would be interesting if this show did something other than show us the usual cliches about Hollywood - that people drive expensive cars, the women are hot, drugs, sex, etc. The show wants us to feel sympathy for Duchovny's character (I guess), but he's so self absorbed he merely manages to bore me. I don't have anything against showing sex in general, but this show tries too hard to shock and titillate. A misogynist character might be interesting, but the show never reveals what is interesting about this particular drug addled misogynist. Instead, we are left with a cliche - the "down on his luck writer". We never even learn anything about his writing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

i don't know if anyone watched the same show as i did, but this was a more disappointing pilot than John from Cincinnati, and that's saying something. Good dialogues? Are you kidding me?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

too unrealistic, 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow a story about a writer that who is self destructive and uses women...yeah really creative. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Californication is the kind of show that promotes itself as cool when it really isn't. It vulgar for vulgarity's sake, with a false sense of provocation (some will always be offended by sex 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I turned the tv off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show seems like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Is it a screwball comedy or one that solves crimes?Either way it isn't funny. Stereotypical black boss, rule-breaking gifted detective and his way too hot and young to be a homicide detective partner. Whichever critics thought this show was funny need a new t.v. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Juvenile...at best.......boring and annoying at worst. The rest of this review is just filler to get up to 150 characters...but I still thought this show was lame. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It suffers from the same old cookie cutter network formulas. Odd to poor casting. Outlandish unbelievable scenarios.  I loved Andy Samberg in Cuckoo (UK), that part was what he excels at.  This cop thing not so much. Its just so far fetched you can never really get into it.  They could not have done much worse, this just has no chance of renewal or pickup. This show is DOA unfortunately. Fox cant get a comedy hit to save their lives. It was doomed the second it was announced on that network.  The critics are drinking their own bathwater. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the first season and part of the second after friends insisted that it was a good show. The show is a mess. There are too many characters and it makes them all seem under-served and not believable. Even for a show that is purposely goofy and light it's hollow. It reminds me of when the Office cast grew to the point of it being too noisy. Brooklyn nine nine seems to have started there. Samberg isn't protagonist material either and that makes the rest of the show suffer. No single point for the audience to jump off of. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This season COULD have been great. The previous season, in my opinion the best since season 4, left us with the perfect starting point for what could have been a climactic final run for Dexter. Yet Season 8 starts things off by immediately jumping ahead, cheapening the experience and impact of LaGuerta's death, Dexter's mess, and Deb's dilemma, while simultaneously diffusing all sense of tension and finality. While these aspects are explored in the initial episodes, particularly the impact on Deb, it's not nearly as satisfying as it could have been.

Season 8 is filled to the brim with questionable direction, writing, and pacing. Far too much time has been devoted to the meaningless arcs of side characters, not to mention the screen time eaten up by Harrison Morgan  I realize he's just a kid, but as far as child actors go, this is one of the worst I've ever seen. The treadmill scene was hilariously awful. I just can't take the show seriously whenever he opens his mouth.

Dr. Vogl comes across as a convenient (and sudden) addition to the plot, but the role she played in Dexter's 'creation' seems to be more of a deus ex machina than anything else. I, for one, never felt particularly invested in her story or what she added to the fabric of the show. Zach Hamilton was an even more questionable addition to the cast and overall arc of the series, considering his untimely demise and utter lack of resolution.

As I'm writing this, we have one episode left of Dexter, and there's simply no way this mess of a season can be tied together with any semblance of cohesion. Which is a shame, considering how great the show was in its infancy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The final chapter is one of the worse chapters I have witness in the story of entertainment.

Looking for Hanna? Yeah lets go outside with my bright yellow hair and not even sunglasses on. For a smart fugitive that is utterly moronic.

Then we have the ninja private detective. Paranoid fugitive doesn't notice him to be sit half meters away until the bus start running; and just because he brought her attention.

Did you kill somebody inside a police department? Don't worry bro, sure the judge have no questions for ya'  you are good to go hermano.

My sister is dead? Better desecrate her body. F_ck the rest of our friends and the great funeral she would have got.

My son is away? F_ck that little b*tch  too. No dad emotional or financial support for you.

So better drive my boat into a tornado and kill myself; and use my superpowers to get out of there and stay in my cabin forever afterwards.

Is like the writers got drunks and wrote the worse script possible. Seriously, where did they hire those people? There are fan made seasons which are way more elaborate. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This season of Dexter has to be the worst yet. It's a diabolical mess of incident-free scenes, poorly edited and clumsily written. I don't care about any of the characters any more because whatever happens to them, seems to not matter in the long run. Story lines are just thrown away in exchange for new characters and irrelevant sub-plots.

This is TV at it's most disappointing. Dexter had some fantastic early seasons, but has come down to be one of the most unfortunate in TV history. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Finally this terrible season has come to an end! Whoever kidnapped the Dexter from season 1-4 needed to bring him back to make this sorry season somewhat better. I never thought i would rate this low for a Dexter season but this one deserves it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I recorded the first episode last night based on critics review of 72.  After watching it, I have to assume that this score with crash down once other critics chime in.  This show was terrible.  The jokes were pretty crass of the time slot and the position between the middle and modern family.  Also, they just were not funny.  The editing it choppy and the setup is lame.  The best thing I can compare it to is Cougar Town.  If you like that, watch this.If you like this type of humor, try Louise.  Louise is vulgar, dark and crass, but is very funny.  This show will not be around long if it does not get better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Couldn't make it through the first episode. It's got an incredibly predictable plot for each situation and then throws in over the top gags to attempt to balance it out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like the show, I really did. Maron simply lacks the charisma necessary to star in his own vehicle. His acting is HORRIBLE. Stilted. He doesn't have Larry David or Louis CK's charm. The shows fell flat. I'll stick to his podcasts in the future. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Longest two hours of my life. An uneven, tedious, cliche-ridden, smutty bore, full of uninteresting caricatures, hammy performances and very cheap thrills. It feels like too many cooks and HBO was afraid to give notes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For a hip hot try especially on hbo - this is one boring disaster.
Holes big enough to put another series in.
Over the top acting from amazing actors.
So -- Mediocre plotting.  Writing.  Directing. Terrible dialogue.  Not even from then.
I turned it off half an hour in humming the ambiance and the set decoration. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After the first 15 minutes of watching and being made to want to shoot cocaine into my eyeballs while being assaulted with second rate proto punk I switched this off 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It seems like maybe my demographic (young male) is being purposefully ignored in the writing of this season. I'm trying to watch it but there's just too much drama and not enough real tension. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well...I have to say that season 3 of American Horror Story was corny as hell and the biggest piece of crap in comparison to the last two seasons. I sat through this entire season just hoping that at some point it would turn around, but it just got worse and worse and worse. The story started off promising, but turned out to be an epic failure. It seemed like eventually all I was watching was a repeat episode of a bunch of teenybopper whinny **** constantly fighting and arguing over who was going to be the next "supreme." I'm not sure why they even bothered putting Evan Peters in this one. I'm not sure why Jamie Brewer can't ever make it an entire season, especially since she was one of the few likable characters in this season. They took the Stevie Nix thing waaaay too far, and even the damn background music lacked in depth. All they ever played was this little girl La La La La **** in the background non-stop. Jeez, not only did they get lazy with developing a decent story, but they even got lazy with the film score too! It's like they straight up didn't give a damn with this one. Oh well...Good riddance is all I can say. I certainly hope the next season helps to redeem the series, and helps me to forget about this lame-ass bloody tampon of a season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay... Season three sucks major dick. The whole **** season was a huge advertisement for tampons. It seemed like the writers felt the need to attract 13 year old girls so they went **** by taking New Orleans voodoo stories and raped them by the eyes with some teenage **** like ostracising, having a boyfriend, being careful so you won't get gang raped etc... To be honest I wouldn't mind if that **** existed in some sort of subplot, but for some reason they made it into the main **** thing. Seriously.... it's frustrating. Season 2 actually gave me a good scare. It was good enough to be called horror or even thriller, but season three... Just a huge steaming pile of **** I really wanna runt a lot about it because i wasted my time and I can't get that **** back... The only reason I am giving it 2 points is because Jessica Lange is giving an excellent performance. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was very pleased to American Horror Story Season 3, but unfortunately I'm a little frustrated. I do not like comedy. American Horror Story S3 but tends to be a comedy show for me. Annie Wilkes in Misery was really creepy, but here it has something of a clown. The trailers have promised more. The theme of witches has given away here completely. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched seasons 1 and 2 with great pleasure. I'm greatly DISAPPOINTED in season 3 as it is BLATANTLY RACIST.  We live in the year 2014, yet the gruesome images I had to endure watching the opening of the 1st episode were sickening. Not sure if I'll watch the remaining episodes. KKK, slavery reminders and stereotypical images of women of color are key points in this season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was clearly the worst season on AHS.. the whole season was like teen age drama... it lacked focus.. with so many thing happening simultaneously it screwed up everything... instead of trying to do so many many things if they kept the plot focused, it would have made sense... It had so much potential! much more potential than the previous seasons but they squandered it by trying to over do it.... very disappointed with the season.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, I couldn't see more than 1 episode of Gotham. It was enough for me to see that the show is thousand of miles away from the high standards set by Nolan or the new comic books editions (Renaissance). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is way overrated here. To be clear, i'm no fan of the Batman universe, I've seen and loved Burton and Nolan's movies but that's it.
After the pilot, which is really really bad, I tried to go on and see if the show becomes better, but here i am, 3 episodes later, still confused about why this show is rated 71 here. It is terrible, the acting is bad, the dialogues are poor. Ok the stories aren't so bad, but it's always uselessly brutal and bloody, with horror movie music in the back, and that's only because this is what keeps people in front of the tv today, and i love bloody shows but it just feels terribly wrong and useless here. I'm gonna watch marvel's daredevil now, hopefully it'll be better. I'd even prefer watch the entire Smallville series all over again than this **** 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The pilot was not intriguing at all. The direction was mediocre. It is like the worst cop show ever. I expected more from Gotham. It just failed to entice me. One show off my list. Not going to watch again. Poor acting, except for Ben. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A real downer of a comic book inspired series.  If Gotham spent even half as much time on developing characters I could care about and interesting stories with at least a little tongue in cheek humor rather than self consciously emphasizing how great its film noir looks are, it might be a bearable hour.  Otherwise, this is a depressing, dour and boring way to spend an hour. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you ignore the dialogue, acting, writing, casting, music as well as the attempt to awkwardly introduce every character from the Batman universe in just one episode, then you would have at Gotham's core an interesting show.  Magically in the midst of the Gotham train wreck the Penguin happens to be a well acted decent character.  Not quite hopeless as a show, however, it's pulse is beating very faintly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I couldn't get through the first episode. Too cliché, too predictable, too "hey look that character is gonna be a villain, can you guess which one?!?". Also the old cop / young cop dynamic is not modern at all and just made me roll my eyes the whole time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only part I like was how awesome Gotham City looked... Though it was like a preschooler easteregg hunt for comicbookies.... yup... take Batman outta Batman and you get crap 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was hoping for a good, fun comedy, instead I found a ridiculous premise amplified by sketchy writing.

I thought the writing would have been better to support the quality and strength of the cast.  But in the pilot episode, I found my mind wandering off, thinking about more enjoyable things.

I took the show off my DVR's list of shows to record each week.

I had such high hopes..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Rob Lowe, I love Fred Savage, but I hated this show.  It wasn't funny.   I actually knew I would dislike the concept as a whole, but gave it a chance because I've loved the actors since childhood.  Maybe I have a suspension of disbelief problem as a lawyer who can't so much as watch Law and Order without getting frustrated. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Martin is not amusing. He finds himself much funnier than he is, and that is insanely bothersome to me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was really looking forward to this series.  I love Fred Armisen.  However, the first of six episodes ended with a thud and not much promise. I shouldn't watch this much comedic talent in one show and not even crack a smile. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is a poorly written heavy handed approach, and, I believe, an embarrassment for Kiefer Sutherland coming off an outstanding series like 24. The expected family issues are poorly conveyed and simply raised as a means to an unimportant end. This was poorly executed. The problems the new president faces is also sickeningly simple minded using heavy handed brutish political broad strokes, assuming a bigoted governor, muslim hatred, a general out to take over before even vetting this new President, a wily conniving congressional designated survivor, the improvised bomb chamber. Who wrote this drivel? Please focus on the real inevitable human drama and real strategic issues and don't come into this with a clear political agenda: the good president, the conniving female other designated survivor, the pushy, treacherous general. Uch. I can't believe Mr Sutherland is allowing these hack writers tarnish his reputation with such poor writing. Even the scene with the seals was staged or crafted in such an obvious way that it has to make one want to puke--and that is sad. The reason for two stars is that it is interesting enough to try to watch, considering the hope that someone will try to bring this out of the garbage and add some sheen to it. It does have Kiefer Sutherland in it, and he can shine if given decent material. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too much propaganda ruined what could have been one of the best political thrillers ever made.

What starts off as an incredible premise with fast paced political thrill, quickly turns into a leftist democrat propaganda series.

Lets go over a few things here:
- Apparently the biggest priority for the government and the new President after being effectively wiped out is to combat racism and let in syrian refugees. No kidding entire episodes are spent on these topics.

- the show spends a significant amount of time talking about tolerance, racism, islamophobia and accepting syrian refugees, not focusing at the actual crisis going on.

- There are so many scenes that act out as debates between pro refugee and pro islam view points vs what they show as racist white nationalists (portaryed by republican governors)
- Republicans are shown as racists while democrats shown as tolerant

- The extreme focus on democrat liberal agenda turns this show from a political thriller to a propaganda piece, real shame.

- Terrorists have a sob story to create sympathy about why they commit these acrs,

- FBI are shown as weak in the interrogation room not being tough and bending over. This is because the show spends alot of time lecturing us about how enhanced interrogation doesnt work.

- Sutherland has a very inconsistent personality, sometime we see his tough no nonsense attitude then he retreats to being a wuss coward especially if its something politically correct.

- State of Michigan is shown as a racist state which beas up Muslims, i bet this was punishment for them for voting Trump.

Overall this show is completely opposite of what 24 was, that show was about Americana, patriotism and toughness this one is all about political correctness ..times have really changed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring. Didn't explain several times how the police found certain people, not easy to follow. Nothing I would watch if it ever came back, amazed I did get thru 6 episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The idea sounded promising but began to fizzle out at the halfway point, maybe because of the cast of failed actors. Since I didn't care about any of the characters, I wasn't concerned about what was going to happen to them in the future. A real disappointment. Will probably not last more than a couple of months. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If the critics think this show is funny and deserves your attention for 30 minutes each week then they have never sat through an entire episode. The show is terrible. Period. Whoever conceived the bit about playing an "air shovel" should be fired immediately. It's a shame because Amy Poehler can be very funny, just not in this not-funny disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was hoping and praying for some insightful humor and commentary - I did not see any. Really wanted a m ore cerebral alternative to Fallon and Kimmel who are way too sophomoric, not getting the sense this is going to work on any level. I grew up with Carson and was a fan of Leno, no heir apparent in any of the current offerings in my opinion. I will give it a few more tries however. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is bouncing around like a jackass, making goofy faces, and delivering utterly pedestrian trying way too hard humor remotely worthy of this show much less at all funny?  The new opening credits sequence is great though and by far the most inspired stroke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It's basically a soap opera based in the late 18th century. The problem is that the characters aren't that interesting. This is not Downton Abbey or anything even close to that level and scale. Not every thing that comes out of the British Isles is worth the effort. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Tries too hard to seem naturalistic but nobody in reality talks like that. It just has the effect that many of the conversations are unbearable. And it's just BLA BLA BLA while not much of substance comes across. But they are all very easy and fun. If that was the purpose of the whole thing, saying nothing but very casually, then they succeeded. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why do i care about a disfunctional family fighting aliens. I was bored to death and had to turn off the pilot halfway into it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the second episode, falling for the ads where they tell you how many gabillion people watched the show and all think it rocks. I don't usually give in to this tactic, but I enjoy sci-fi. so I decided to give it a chance. Here was that episode, for the most part: Dude check out that skeleton! I will. Dude, did you check on that skeleton? Not yet. Meanwhile: Mommy never came home from work. Your mommy never came home from work? I can't believe mommy didn't come home from work. You say what now about the mommy and the never home coming? Meanwhile: We gotta check out that skeleton. Ok let's do that. Meanwhile: Ma'am did you realize that you never came home? Your kids said so. I didn't? Meanwhile: SKELETON? OMG, NOT THERE! Meanwhile: As a concerned mommy, I'm concerned I never came home. It literally accomplished nothing, was written like a school play, and was horribly acted. I'll pass. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was disappointing, and like so many others that have commented on here, the humor was forced, the N word gratuitous and the situations just dont play out the same way on the screen compared to a comic strip. I think that this is another product of mistaking shock with comedy on a larger scale. It works effectively in the strip because of the quickness/sharpness of delivery, but ends up becoming tired old jokes that I heard/saw/said about 3-5 years ago. This was disappointing for mcGrueder who with his strip, elevated the ability for a strip to be more than "just a strip". The cartoon undermines his creatvitiy and voice. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high hopes for the show, and I was a big fan of McGruder's printed work. However I have to call him out as a hypocrite and panderer. The consistent nauseating and gratuitous use of the N word is disgusting. I thought the Klan wrote the show as the N-bombing is nothing less than a total degradation of people of African anscestry. Thanks Aaron for contributing nothing except self-hatred and ugly stereotypes. Nowhere else in the world will you find a race pushed into the gutter in this manner. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This just wasn't funny. I don't mind tackling race, but take a tip from the Chapelle Show, because what he did was actually funny. I'm not sure what show these other reviewers are watching. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I hope it gets better. The strip is pretty funny, so I'm willing to give this show another shot, but the first episode was really bizarre and not that funny. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is as ignorant as you get. Its main goal is to shock and try to brainwash the youth in believing all whites are evil racists. That itself is not helping the black cause its just further dividing the population. This show isn't funny at all . Dave Chapelle is funny even though he deals with the same subject matter it seems to be more poignant than this silly attempt to deal with issues using animation. Watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force , Harvey Birdman , Stroker & Hoop or Squidbillies to get you're ***** and giggles. The Boondocks will not make it to another season and thank god for that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My wife and I must be missing something. We are huge AHS fans but this season was a disaster. All over the place with the twists and turns and none of them very compelling. We didn't find this season suspenseful, scary or captivating. There was no emotional attachment to any character. To us this is now 2 subpar seasons in a row. It's time for Ryan Murphy to get back to basics and develop characters we can care about and build a story that flows well from start to finish. Dig out the Coven/Asylum recipe and deliver a fulfilling season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I actually thought this was awful!  I stopped watching "AHS" in the middle of the 3rd season.  I was excited for this season though due to all the teasers and such.  I was SO disappointed! The whole "mockumentary" crap can go away.  Just wasn't scary to me at all.  Very boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

American Horror Story Roanoke gets worse every time you think about it. This season was so dull and boring. The acting is still good the story is **** these actors really need to stop wasting there talent on this because they could do so much better. I would rather watch Hotel even know it is worst then this at least it has it's moments and is entertaining. That ending was f ucking s hit. Horrible season 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The whole thing just reminds me of people taking selfies. I groaned when I found our what Episode 6 had in store. Ok....a tv show about a tv show. But then it did it again. Stop already!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm going to have to agree with most of the negative reviews here.  Below-average-looking neurotic guy + troubled super-attractive woman talking about their feelings and 1st world problems (only in LA...waah, waah).  This is essentially a mediocre and more annoying Annie Hall strung out over 8 episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mikey is the most annoying character i have ever seen in a show. shes like a sad sac child who cant decide what she wants. she wants to be with Gus then when he takes her to do anything she just **** the entire time. it hurts to watch. she also trys to pull the crazy card when shes the crazy one. the show would be better without her. kill her off 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just don't get the fascination. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I too was looking forward to this show. What a complete and utter disappointment it has been. The premise sounded great and I love a good thriller or zombie/vampire show. This show fails miserably on so many levels. It is not scary nor is it thrilling in the least. The plot is so nonsensical and unbelievable it borders on absurdity and it's hard not to see the whole thing as pure camp. This is like a mediocre B movie at best. Most if not all the characters are downright annoying. The biggest joke is when the supreme vampire/whatever appears. It was the most anti-climatic and laughable scene in the entire season. My Maltese is scarier than that thing. The flashbacks to Nazi Germany is pure filler and a snooze fest.  At least with The Walking Dead, or movies like 28 Days Later, there is some suspension of disbelief. The idea that the main character is taking his son with him to kill the vampires is absurd. This band of nitwits appear to be the only people in all of New York (or the world for that matter) to care that there is a plague and threat to turn humans into vampires.  I can't believe all of the positive reviews as well as the fact that it has been renewed for another season. I feel like I am watching a different show than these people. I think a lot of the success of the show must rest on the blood and gore factor. The only reason I kept watching it was the hope it would grow on me. Never happened. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe I wasted an hour watching the pilot. I probably would have really liked it if I was 12. The futuristic sound effect when the CDC guy was texting his son made me laugh. Overall, it was too "comic-booky" for my taste, and I didn't find any of the characters very relatable. I'm really surprised to see so many positive reviews, both from the critics and users. I don't mind campy humor in sci-fi; however, in this case it was obviously unintended. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What an absolute waste of a good premise. I honestly expected more from FX and Guillermo Del Toro.
Whoever was responsible for casting this show should be fired asap. The cast is basically a hodge-podge of B level actors from failed shows and no-name actors with boviously minimal acting experience.
Couple that with horrible color/tin saturation, a generally cheesy, made-for-tv feel and music that tries way too hard to elicit emotion/fear and you have the formula for a really bad show.
In today's world of high-quality television production dominated by IFC, Sundance, BBC, HBO and the likes, this abysmal showing from FX is really quite disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am going to have to agree with mjkelly93 on this one. In the first place, the writers (and the "star") are so stupid that they don't even know that "CDC" stands for "Centers FOR Disease Control," not "Centers OF Disease Control." I would say the acting was wooden, but that would be an insult to trees. The SFX are so cheesy that they are at least 10 year-old technology. The plot-line is older than I am, and I am almost as old as the crazy bearded guy. BTW, note to Ted Cruz: we really have to get serious about the immigration problem in America because lately several plots have called for nut jobs to risk the fate of the world so some family member could be cleared through US Immigration! Meanwhile, the star has an extreme "hottie" colleague hanging all over him, while back at home his estranged wife wants to make whoppie with Mr. Maytag. Jettison this turkey and watch Halle Berry on "Extant"! The only reason I gave this a "2" instead of a "0" is that something worse can always come along. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolutely boring pilot.
So far I could only see the pilot. But the bored already after the opening credits. Nothing against vampires or the genre but that's presented so lame. The actors do not sell well in the series and the dialogues are just stupid Bla Bla. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe I sat through two episodes of this show.

The pilot had a great premise, but the execution was pretty lame.

I watched the second episode, hoping the writers would rally and bring the show up to the level promised by the concept presented in the pilot.

Sadly, I was disappointed.

Just what we need, yet another walking dead / vampire   show.

I had high hopes based upon the previews.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

2nd season is awful... the science teacher that thinks she is the savior, raining blood.... come on.

I got hooked on series but.... if it stays on the current course i will not watch.. to bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I couldn't watch more than the first episode, which bored me so much. Nothing is natural nor subtle in the show, and situations which could have been realistic and simply grotesque. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was excited to see this show based but it ended up a huge disappointment and no better than Harper's Island (itself an atrocious TV serial). The characters in Under The Dome are paper thin to match the story. It is larded with cliche and contrived plot points, things like the following: Person A: "I wonder what the old sheriff was up to" Person B: "Well, he never walked around without his hat." Person B then takes his hat from the coat rack and looks inside. "Hey, here's a key hidden in his brim." Person A: "I have one just like it, it opens a safety deposit box!" Person B: "Let's go!"
I'm paraphrasing here, but not by much. This is just about the complexity of the story that runs throughout the entire series. I haven't even finished the final disc...I'm painstakingly making my way through the last few episodes.
Another example is the town psycho is deputized after performing one nice deed. It makes absolutely no sense. The entire town knows he's a nutter! And there are so many contrived instances of drama, such as one of the police officer's pulling his gun on a crowd because he can't handle the pressure of the Dome. It makes absolutely zero sense, and there's no way a trained officer would crack like that. It's the type of shoe-horned drama that falls so flat it turns the desired moment laughable.
There are also many "As you know Bob" moments, which is to say that a character says something that would never be said, but only to 'educate' the audience. An early example is how electronics stopped working and one character questions why his watch still works, and the female officer glances over at his watch and 2 seconds later says "I can see that watch is a windup...this must only effect battery operated devices" or some such nonsense that is telegraphed as information for the audience but in fact makes you feel like you're watching a teaching moment on par with Sesame Street.
These ratings are certainly arbitrary. I gave it a 2. It could be a 1 or a 3 or some variant in-between. The point to bring home is it is very bad television.
If you are a fan of mindlessly contrived auctioneers such as the aforementioned Harper's Island, or Prison Break, or 24 (though even 24 had some fun moments in the early seasons), then this would be right up your alley. But if you like smart television (the things you would see on HBO, AMC, Showtime), then this program is NOT for you.
The fact that the critics have rated this a higher score than the users is, in fact, mind boggling. Normally I find that the critics have an eye for quality, at least more so than the masses. Here, inexplicably, the lower user score is the more reliable number (though still far too high, IMRO). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I wanted to like this show... But like so many before it in this genre (Jericho, Revolution, Defiance, et al) it was a complete fail. Characters making irrational choices, forced uninspired and uninteresting crisis moments, trope after trope, one dimensional characters, HORRIBLE acting (even by historically good actors), poor CGI,  and awful dialogue.  The premise is the only potentially exciting aspect of the show.  How do these writers, directors, and producers get their jobs?  Have they ever watched Game of Thrones or Walking Dead to see how it SHOULD be done? They would have done better giving a first year film class the project. Waste of time. So sad-- it's my favorite genre. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as I wanted to enjoy this, with Jack Bender's directing credentials and being an adaptation of a Steven King novel, it does disappoint. Although some of the performances from the veteran actors were okay, the younger and inexperienced actors come off as cliched and 1 dimensional. Although I mentioned Jack Bender earlier, he did not direct the season premiere, which is unfortunate seeming as the directing was distinctly average. I also mentioned Steven King, whose adaptations usually result in stellar pieces of writing, here, it falls short. The special effects were also off and detracted from the overall experience. I barely finished the pilot episode and would recommend that you avoid this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointed that this turned out to be a melodramatic 'people are horrible when cut off from society' show, as opposed to a science fiction show.  I thought it would be a loaded with surprizes, mystery, and great characters but in fact became predictable, barely about the mystery and I wasn't cheering for anyone.  What kept me watching was that there was some really good acting, I thought both Britt Robertson (as Angie) and Alexander Koch (as the very disturbing Junior) were very good.  I tried to keep it on my schedule, but decided to stop watching after Episode 6 because it just got too disturbing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was hoping this show would have more action. A lot of fake drama and buildup during the episodes. I could care less about the characters and the finale was dull... The finale, with the changing of the color of the dome and the revelation that the dome was created by some supernatural, or alien, force was boring and uninteresting. Who is the Monarch? What is the Monarch? Why do I care? I don't.

Should have stuck with a single season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Started out loving this show, it got stranger and stranger but still couldn't wait for each new show. The final episode was more than awful, it made no sense and was a waste of my time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I admit, there's a certain satisfaction in watching this series disintegrate over the last few months. The initial premise was more than interesting enough to make up for the deficiencies, but over time as essentially nothing happens to advance the plot--and it's taken 11 episodes to get 8 days into the story--you can no longer ignore the problems. I'm not on set, of course, but you have to lay blame at the feet of the director.

The worst problem is probably the wooden acting. Even the kids, for whom this could be a breakout performance, are so clearly phoning it in that it's laughable. But without any acting to distract you, the innumerable issues with the plot and continuity are just that much easier to notice. It's just full of fundamental logistical and environmental inconsistencies which you could ignore, except they supposedly play a role in the plot. Where is the water coming from? Why is the power still on? Remember the giant bomb? Were there no consequences? Aren't there like 5,000 people in this town? Where are they all? Do their toilets still flush?

It's a complete train wreck, almost unbearable to watch as it progresses. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well, it started dubiously, but with Stephen King source material, there was a little hope for a good series.

8 episodes in, it has descended into the worst kind of fickle, soapy melodrama you could imagine. We are past car crash TV now, and I want those 8 hours back. Quite how Spielberg allows his name to feature in the credits is beyond me. If I was him I would kill the project and issue a public apology. Seriously, this makes Falling Skies look like BSG, which as we all know, it isn't... Give this a miss for your own sanity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First of all: I think Steven Spielberg is not always great. For my taste, most of Spielberg 's family stuff. His tendency to put children and young people make to the forefront of almost all children's programs. As is true of Cowboys vs. Aliens , Real Steel , ... Third Child tec. If it's not funny is that it is eternal whining , drama, whining , drama ... etc. He makes blockbusters for the mainstream. But those were also the Waltons and Little House on the Prairie and just like this , most of Spielberg a vale of tears and glop from soppiness .

Steven King is also not a great writer in the sense of literature. But success in terms of spirit of the age . Filmizations more B-movies ( maybe excludet Shining and Misery ), but he is probably a member of the Hollywood club.

Nevertheless, I expected in Tension " Under the Dome " in Germany and yesterday I watched all the episodes of the first season. It started not bad. But minimalism was noticed already . Poor or immature GFX / VFX . A half a cow only in the formation of the dome, extremely unspectacular, here one would have liked a little more devotion, a Demonstartion a force of nature, a spectacle. Even here a wasted potenial ! Even later, the butterflies are poorly made. But actually typical Spielberg. Should that be " spielberg cuteness " when a bad- made ​​butterfly unrealistic totter through the image , or inability of the special effects team? Then you should start looking for much better amateurs in the field of Blender 3D . This is generally meant for the special effects.

Maybe it is all so in the book by King, no idea, i did not read ( never read King, except " the Mist " short story) , but for a movie / series at the present time (American Horror Story , Salem, Breaking Bad , SoA etc. ) effeminate and out of place. Overall, I find the serial character and also immature and too quickly dealt with . One could list many details of the superficiality here. The more episodes the more it is likely a soap.

J. J. Abrams is also not good for everything. But the implementation would certainly become mystical and exciting. Or Lindelof. Apparently it can but some men do their "producer / editor-experiments" to continue. They love each other and is very very great friend. Under the Dome is a good example of such Hollywood "incest".  In the main, you have done something together, squandered millions as others (ordinary people) cook or bake together on Fridays. So it makes it seem.

Would " Hank " not there ( Dean Norris ), I would not have looked further from the 7 episode.

I am very disappointed on the one hand . On the other hand , it is still typical. Spielberg was in his time the opponent by Carpenter ( Hollywood Goodboy vs. Hollywood Badboy. Had his own right to life in the eighties. But today? Only tearjerker!). In the eighties! Spielberg may still be a crowd-pleaser, I find it boring. ( Did I ever ). It has not changed . He reached it, to turn a good idea into a great sappy mass product.

Pity!

Whether I look at the next season? I do not know. Maybe it's because other brilliant series just have a break. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just don't bother.  The show quickly turns from an interesting premise to a crushing disappointment.  The last 2 episodes of Season 1 were so contrived, with wooden dialogue and what seems to be every cliche in the network TV book,  they are not even laughably bad, they're just bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I think I have finally reached my limit of dystopian/apocalyptic survival premises in which Conrad's Heart of Darkness is played over and over again. The only thing that's missing here is cannibalism, but maybe if I stick around long enough (fat chance), someone will dine on another. Enough already. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stephen King's book wasn't great and was definitely overblown, but the story was sound even if the style wasn't. This rather insulting adaptation which takes many a liberty with the original is full of cliches, irritating characterisations and cloying sentimentality. In all fairness episode 1 worked really well and the one thing that  the show excels at is the  special effects. It's all watch ably bad, but tiresomely predictable and oh so p c.  Occasionally it even remembers to resemble the book. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have tried to come up with a reasonable review but the only thing I can think of is disappointment.  Read the book, the acting is much better and the scenery is superior too. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After watching the first two episodes I couldn't understand how Stephen King who I believe is an above average author would create such a simplistic and silly plot. King usually creates quite lifelike and vivid characters, not the kid's play that I saw on television.

So I bought the book...and I can tell you that the series is a not even close to what I've read until now. Well, there's a dome, yep, they got that one right. And some of the character names are the same. But that's basically it.

It's exactly what one would expect from network television these days. A water-downed plot, a few pretty faces and over 10 million people tuning in every week... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

You Stephen King fans out there:  "Under The Dome" Spoiler Alert!   Don't expect the excellent translation to the small screen like they did with "The Stand" or even "Salem's Lot".  Hollywood took this masterwork of Mr. King's (his best next to "The Stand" and shoved it through the shredder.  Then they patched up all of the holes with new characters and added a completely altered story-line.  They basically just kept the title. Why tamper with perfection?  SKIP THE TV!!!    READ THE BOOK! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is not very good.  If i didn't see Breaking Bad i wouldn't know how great of an actor Dean Norris is.  Rachelle Lefevre is from Revolution and plays pretty much the same type of character she did in that show and its very generic so i have no idea how much she can bring to her work.  All the other actors seemingly do their jobs as best they can with a really terrible script.  The problem with "under the Dome"  is not the ideas for the world they exist in or the relationships and character choices but how quickly the characters are forced to service the next plot point without really being affected by the last drama they just experienced.  Its like the show is going through a checklist of moments they have to hit for drama's sake.  So the result is a seemingly very stupid script that doesn't even hold as much logic as a night time soap like "Revenge".  Its like a series of short video clips of characters dealing with a bunch of writer's ideas for drama inside this domed town.
What they should have done (regardless of the book's plot points which i never read) is let the character's choices affect the characters and develop in the character's relationship to how they deal with a few simple choices.  There are way way way too many crazy plot developments for each character and the story lines are abandoned by the writing  by the end of two episodes.  It's as if it all didn't matter because now we are on to the next thing.  Its like its written by a twelve year old. This show makes me yell at the screen "really?  you just did that and now your going to just move on as if it never happened?" 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The only time You care about a character is when you want them to die, so you don't have to watch them anymore. Other than the 2 main male actors, it feels like we are watching extras reading terrible dialogue.

The biggest mystery in the dome  is actually the Lesbian family... 3 hard-to-look-at females. You immediately assume that what they lack in looks will be made up for in talent.. but no.  Well, at least the same sex family will have an interesting story when isolated in this traditional small town... right?    ...WRONG.

If the concept seems intriguing, i strongly suggest reading (or listening) to the book. The show turns a good story into a high school play. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not interested in the pyhco boyfriend or whose hoarding gas or junk, is this a sci fi or what? The only way i can stand watching this show is recording it and fast forwarding to the interesting bits which are not many.  Where is this story going anyway. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If George Lucas raped and murdered Indiana Jones and Star Wars from the memories of our youth, Arrested Development Season 4 tortured, maimed, killed, dug up, urinated on the corpses, then buried upside down, the memories of our youth. This is not just a bad show if you were starting with Season 4 and knew nothing of the series, it's a bad show if you were a super-fan of the first three Seasons. The format of one show dedicated to a single character's story arc, the truly over-the-top nonsensical meandering story line, the re-hashed jokes that were cheap rip offs of clever originals. In every single way, Season 4 comes up short against the originals.

I probably watched Season 4 a dozen times through, each time finding new jokes I had missed before. I doubt I'll suffer through the 15 episodes of Season 4 ever again. One of the strengths of the series was character interaction, quick dialog. With single characters so heavily focused on, it removed the interaction that made it so funny. With so many story lines that branch off and really never close and never go anywhere, even if they are setting it up for a movie, Season 4 turned me off, and bored me so supremely, I'll be waiting for the movie to be three years old and make it back to Netflix, as opposed to ever seeing it in the theaters.

2/15 episodes made me feel like I was watching a continuation of this fine series. The rest were just mediocre, or outright awful. As excited as I was for the release, this couldn't have been a bigger entertainment letdown. There's always money in the banana stand, but apparently that's where they left the funny. It pains me to say this-if you were a big fan...avoid Season 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Taken from the first 5 episodes of the 4th season. Season 1-3  10/10

What have they done, in the effort to bring it back on Netflix, they clearly havent had the money to get every cast member involved, so thats led to this awful new one character per episode format.
Sadly, these characters are not funny on their own, they go about boring lives. The glory of this comedy was putting them in a room, and watching them scheme and fight and joke off each other.

The very first episode is one of the most boring 30 minutes of my life, awful writing, boring scenes and story.  A forced Loose Seal reference, forced cancelled references, dumb facebook joke, terrible young versions of characters, over narration. George Michael also feels too old to be the hilarious Cera character.
This show has gone horribly away from what made it so good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My suspension of disbelief is now permanently suspended. This show was good in seasons 1 & 2, but when you start bringing characters back from the dead because you have run out of innovative ideas, it's time to hang it up--which they should have done after season 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is this show all about torture now? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is just another one of those British exports that are drawn out with too many characters; some that are just boring.

While I like historical movies, documentaries and TV shows, this one is just too slow-paced for me.

After enduring the first two episodes I decided that enough was enough. My goodness the actual war between Napoleon and the Russians took less time than this television program. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pretty apparent that the writers have lost the core site of the other seven seasons of archer. The characters seem to have the same personality with a twist that just doesn't fit. After the first two episodes, I find myself wanting to try and give it another look. Personally would rather watch the old episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh, dawg, watching this made me realize why I didn't like it. Clank, clank clank. The plot cranks on, with the automatons who impersonate actors on it blustering. Make it stop! please! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ever since a second man was introduced, the show has went downhill. I almost thought they killed off the rest of the cast and they were ready to re-tool, but NOPE. It's okay to have the women sleep with the same guy as long as it's Boris Kodjoe, no wonder it's so easy for guys like him to be players. I know tv is dominated by a woman audience, but guys need sitcoms that cater to them. It's not like the women wouldn't have run his new society anyway as more and more women come around and they start having Original Phil's children. Him being the ONLY MAN ON EARTH with dozens of women (aka balls and chains) around with babies who need men to reach stuff off the high shelves and open jars and take out the trash, it would introduce it's own kind of comedy, even though he gets to sleep with all these women. Maybe in a 3rd or 4th season of repopulating the Earth they could have introduced one other man. Until they stop making Original Phil the bad guy, I'm done watching AGAIN. Bearded Phil is the guy I bonded with in the first few episodes and I'll never treat him as the bad guy in my mind. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first episode gets a 7/10, the second a 5 / 10 everything else after a 3-1/10.

There is just nothing happening, and not the good kind like in Seinfeld. The main character just keeps on losing and losing and you want something good to happen, but nope. Then also the humor and plot is just becoming generic as hell and boring at the same time.

Not recommended at all... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

honestly this movie sucked. the songs were terrible and it had the most awful plot line. the first movie was great, and it seemed like they were trying way too hard in this one. they ruined the high school musical experience with stupid drama that shouldn't have happened the way it did. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Between seeing Carter trick the men of the show - which isn't much of a feat given how big sexist drooling chumps they are - and Carter manipulating her boss into sending her home from work because she claims she is on her period, I'm really not impressed. Menstruation jokes and the main character making out with a  criminal to trick him doesn't seem fitting. Not for this supposedly strong and clever woman who refuses to play by the men's rules (she in fact does that very thing through the entire pilot).

This show is sexist in its very  claim to have anything to do with feminism, and there is an abundance of shows with actually compelling and well-written female leads, sans using low-cut skirts as a secret weapon and menstruation jokes for cheap laughs. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring.  I watch the pilot because I thought it was an interesting premise based on the promos, but I was bored.  There's just not enough to is.  It's like they thought of the premise and then has no idea where to go from there.  Thanks for cancelling it!

Its starts at the end of the second world war when a married nurse and teacher visit the Scottish Highlands for a vacation and therein setting the scene for the debacle that is about to unfold.  With mystical stories, eulogies of historical factual excerpts, solicited sexual encounters and a fortune teller/druid spewing tales of a world of wonderment and adventure and an ensuing disjointed lifeline is awaiting for the nurse.

What follows is a blandest foray of circumstances that catapults the nurse into a different century and the story unfolds as she touches one of the ancient stone circles and suddenly all isn’t as it seems.

It is just not as interesting as Sleepy Hollow as the lead actress wavering accent and combined vulnerability and stroppiness masks her lack of commanding status.  Maybe an older actress would have been more compelling in handling her hostile environment that she is now aligned. I feel it would have been better as a radio play although we would miss out on the gorgeous visuals of the Scottish countryside.

Overall it’s cheap and tacky similar to Salem and developing into Catherine Cookson/Mills & Boon romantic bile. If you watch it without expectation and you may like it.

I watched the WIZ live and I did not like it.
I love all the stars in it but not is production
I saw the original Wiz on Broadway with Stephanie Mills on Broadway
and the original Wizard of Oz movie many times
In my opinion there will only two people who can do the role
of Dorothy.  Judy Garland in the movies and the spectacular
Stephanie Mills in the broadway production.  Again I love all the stars in
the WIZ live but not in these roles 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

These girls are really cute.  I remember the small one from "Big Bang Theory". She was great as the extremely shy girlfriend.  My problem is that these girls deserve a better show.  They do a great job singing their wild songs, many of which are excellent.  The problem certainly isn't them.  The problem is with the writers.  Yeah, sure, lots of pop culture references and all of that.  The problem is that the writing just isn't really funny.  It sounds a bit funny, but that's the girls again.  It's just not really funny.

Boy I wish these kids had a better show! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In general i'm a period  serial fan, but this imo, is shockingly poor, terrible acting, cumberpatch, lol lives up to his name cold and boring  the plot  is just lacking, seems to be relying on the 'in house' anglophile vote from our distant cousins. sad really, relying on the gullible. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Orphan black is a show where characters constantly break character and say lot of things like:
“Were you followed?”
“Do you have any idea who these people are?”
“You have no idea what is really going on, do you?”
“I don’t want to be a part of this”
This is to create tension and suspense, how sinister…how very sinister indeed.
Writing in poor, characters are given motivations which are convoluted. I mean if you found out that there are half a dozen individuals in the world who are your exact replica, the normal human response would be to find out what the hell is going on, that ought to be motivation enough, not in this show. There are smart Directors and then there are Bad Directors, smart ones know what to let the Audience see and the parts that you can and must skip over. For instance, let’s say that somebody is shot in a car, now unless you are really anal about such things you might not wonder too much about what happened to all the blood (when you see the Heroin drive the same car later). An intelligent Director would know how not to let that thought enter the head of a viewer. Here’s what a Dumb Director would do, he’ll show the Heroin break into a car wash in the middle of the night, use all the equipment, get the car waxed and expect the viewer not to bat an eyelid. Care to venture a guess what kind of a Director made Orphan Black?
Oh Yes, the acting is bad too.
Having said all that, if you are fan of shows like Fringe, Alias & Other shows on the lines of what J.J Abrams does  I hate them, barring early Seasons of Lost  you are going to like Orphan Black. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I usually do not like this type of series from Marvel or DC with Super Heroes and this one was not an exception. I gave it more than one opportunity but after the first good impression on the story i got dissapointed with it. Too many guys with arrows for me in a world with powerful guns. Every episode feel like the same and too predictable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Arrow is just simply bad. I watched nearly all the episodes of season one and looking back i wonder why I even bothered. There were 23 episodes for season one but it could have been edited to only 5. Terrible characters, lame plot, and cheap action scenes make this show a wast of time. The only reason I watched it was because of Deathstroke and at least the parts with him were watchable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show should be going well, but is suffering from dumbed down text. Everyone seems to be haunted with an eternal guilt, every character is always beating him(her)self over a debt of honor even over the smallest issues, most of the time it was not their fault. Some bad guy threatens two dear people to the hero, and a whole plot develops about his guilt of being unable to be in two places at the same time to save both people,
after the bad guy kills one of them. NOBODY seems to blame the bad guy!!! The show had it all to be great, and it's being seriously dumbed down. For instance, Gotham is telling great stories without suffering from this dumb writing that already made me give up watching Flash. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are multiple cliches and plot holes.

It feels like a mix of all of these:

~ person of interest (Tracking down people on a list)
~ Iron man ( imprisoned and escaped.... also random rich dude so he has the money to make a lab....)
~ Robbin hood (they make multiple references to robin hood in the movie aswell)

Person of interest is way better.... It gets a little repetitive after the first season but.... i stopped watching Arrow after the first 5 episodes...... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 2 is really picking up and getting significantly better. I think the CW is finally starting to get that what drives us to a show is content not, subtle marketing tactics or shirtless boys that make the girls swoon. Yes there are still some dumb immature moments and blatant batman like rip offs to drive up ratings. However things seem to be improving for the better. Lets hope that the CW doesn't backslide. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The acting is so very bad. How many more superhero concepts can The CW ruin? The first episode was entertaining, but it has been all downhill from there. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is looking for some good writing, editing, and direction.  The characters are completely dull and uni-dimensional, and after each episode I'm left feeling like 30 minutes passed and I was sitting in front of a screen with nothing but static and disparate Instagram photos of San Francisco with no apparent thematic relation or overall story line.

I get that the protagonist is flawed and has issues, but a skillful writer can take that concept and make it so the character isn't flat out annoying.  The supporting protagonists are mere interlopers to the show as a whole, showing up just when you want to flip all the tables at every coffee shop in the mission because the main character is so annoying.  After watching every episode of the first season I feel like I know nothing more about these people or their environment than I did when the first episode aired.  Basically, there's no story at least not one that is interesting.

The editing and direction need serious help too.  There are pregnant pauses and long overwrought sighs in the dialogue that are wasted moments for character development.  Not to mention the long looks at computer screens for OKCupid or Grindr.  I found myself adding my own dialogue in these moments and then questioned why I am even paying HBO for this show when I'm clearly doing a much better job of entertaining myself.  There are out of place scenes that don't offer much and there are times when I felt like the director didn't even show up to the filming and the actors were winging it.

In the end this show is nothing but a concept, that being "Gay men.  2014.  San Francisco."  From the end product it looks like there was little or no thought past that.  There needs to be something more than that, let us know where these people are from, what brought them to San Francisco, where do they want to go, how do they know each other?  I will say this, my favorite part of the entire first season was the last 2 minutes of the last episode...where you are watching two of the protagonists watch the Golden Girls, a show with all of the attributes that Looking is looking for. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The writers have done a poor job of making the characters believeable. Barry can move people out of harms way when a bullet is flying at them but can't dodge a punch! Wtf is going on here? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am beyond stunned this show got such a high rating. There is not ONE original or thought provoking element to this show at all. Even the writers must think so b/c they plugged in the character of felicity whom I love to give the show some life and she came across all "like me, like me Berry!"

It's just churning out the same outline that Smallville possessed. STOP UNDERESTIMATING THE AUDIENCE WE'RE SMARTER THAN YOU THINK 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Disappointing. Really wanted to like this but is squandered potential cashing in on a built in Superhero/Flash audience. Should probably be on Saturday mornings instead. Breaking the laws of physics one moment and get punched by a "normal speed" Meta-Human the next. Even a 10yo would be saying WTF? What ever happened to smart and clever writers? Everything is a cop out to create forced drama. Superpowers are hard to write for and I am willing to suspend disbelief, but you gotta meet me half way at least. I love Jesse L. Martin and I know he must be throwing up in his mouth a little when delivering some of his lines. If they replace the entire writing staff, I might try season 2. Until then I'll be giving Arrow a try instead.

I couldn't agree more with jakedubbleya's closing statement. I really used the value the metacritic score and it has served me well in the past. Having so many good reviews for this show will make me skeptical of any score here in the future. Sad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A completely cliche-ridden group of actors, who, except for Iris' father, are all flat in their delivery. The writing is less polished than a 12-old could write, full of glaring flaws (the Flash should move faster than light, yet takes minutes to get across town; is constantly being hit, tossed, thrown or struck by lightning (or fists)). One wonders how he survives to the next episode. The actor playing the flash is so bad I don't even know his real name. Emotionally dead 20-somethings who say 'awesome' or 'amazing' or, like Iris, deliver speeches with a smile, minis the conviction.
The CW strikes again. Every hero is 19 (and never actually grows up) and adults play the side parts. The fact that the Flash was an adult when he was struck by chemicals and lightning means nothing when you can re-write comic book story lines. The first Flash show might not have been a hit, but the hero (Barry Allen's father in this show) had some nobility, class and manliness. The  theme of CW? "Teenage boys save the world!" A sad show, which will likely last forever (that's the gimmick). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Absolute **** I don't know how anyone could like a show with such god-awful dialogue and cliched storytelling. Also, why do so many characters spill their life story within a few minutes of being introduced? It leaves no mystery whatsoever, and makes the show boring to watch. 2/10 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I like to watch at least half a season's worth of episodes before giving my opinion. I will admit that i found the first couple of episodes intriguing and fun but got concerned when i saw that this show was going to be a ''villain of the week''  format. In essence what we are being told here is that this explosion that gave Barry his powers also created a slough of other ''meta humans'' who, strangely, are all bad guys (majority).
What also bothers me is the general acceptance by all concerned  that a major explosion occurred causing extreme destruction, not to mention its creation of super powered beings who, for some reason, all get a different power. Would have been more credible in my view to see the army, FBI, Homeland Security etc. get in there to calm things down and investigate what happened,
Maybe I'm asking too much. It is a superhero show after all so i guess i should just kick back and let it
slide. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is depressing. I tolerated this show only cause I want to see if this'll actually go anywhere. This show is chock full of cliches, awful villains, and 0 character development. Awkward wonderbread character fights crime with 2 companions (who are only slightly more interesting than him) and has a bad love ploy who's in love with a more attractive, even blander character who only shows up to stress the fact that Iris (crap love interest) is taken to make us feel bad for Barry (wonderbread character). The only interesting thing to me is the Professor, but even then that's not that great. Would not recommend this show to anyone. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It started building up really nice into a sort of climax with his nemesis. After the "Climax" the series completely lost my interest.. The plot is horrible and the character development is mediocre. What could have been a real good plot, ended up being, in my eyes, a script thrown in the garbage. Really a big disappointment for me.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know why people think this is so hilarious. It tries so hard to be funny...which is why it isn't funny. Kinda like SNL these days. This is probably the easiest role Alec Baldwin has ever played in. Why? Because he doesn't have to act. That's really the way he is. And he just isn't funny. I only laughed maybe twice during a couple of episodes, but never out loud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am confused as to why people think this show is funny.  I watched all of last season because of all the hype it got and because I enjoy the Office and Community.  This show is horrible, and I regret wasting a DVR space on it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This shows first season was absolutely terrible. The story lines went from terrible to mediocre. The acting was mediocre. The show says it is for grown ups and proves that it is by swearing here and there and showing nudity for no purpose other than to prove that it is for grown ups. The swearing and nudity does not further the story line at all. They just seem to be thrown in as an afterthought. Oh ya thats right we are for grown ups, so lets have you show your butt and you say the f word. The story lines don't seem to be story lines for grown ups, in fact most of them seem very cheesy/tongue in cheek like Doctor Who (which I don't mind cheesy because I love Doctor Who), they just don't fit with their "adult theme". Each character has had a gay scene just for the sake of showing gay scenes. I can understand one/two gay character but all of them? This show is just about pushing agenda's through bad storytelling. If they want to push agenda's at least tell us a good story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know whats worse the acting or the writing. A major disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rises to "mediocre" on occasion but this is truly one of the more dreadful genre programs to come down the pike in recent memory. Terrible television with poor production values, bland characters substitute a checklist of hip antihero traits rather than personality and episode plots that liberally raid from better shows. Obviously sailing by on the strength of the Doctor Who brand and the novelty of bisexual characters. Yawn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

.Seriously disappointed. Have watched the whole 6th series. Slow, disjointed, with some characters seemingly have the ability to teleport from one part of the world to another. Some of the visual scenes were stunning as usual and the acting held up well against a poorish script. The biggest downer given the end of series 5 and the threat of the white walkers and the epic impact they were about to have on the 7 kingdoms is completely forgotten for the first 8 episodes and remains so with only the odd scene and passing reference, The Queen of Dragons we thought had an invincible army but somehow this seems to have fallen apart faster than the average British government. Overall you cannot watch this without knowing the makers are milking the franchise by 80% of air time given to minor side plots, minor characters and scenes that don't add anything to the backbone of the plot and in several cases don't fit or have any useful purpose to this series or presumably the next. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It had three good episodes, but even those had annoying moments, so I guess when you round it up it deserves a nice solid two.

Hey, it's still better than the 5th season tho! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Game of Thrones started its 6th season, and the white walkers are still walking. Johns dead, and we knew that already. This series is starting to be like all the rest.  Dragging the plot out as long as possible just to make more money.  Only problem with that is...yes im bored, and tired of watching the same ole plot never ever working out.  Time travel would be the only thing worse at this point. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing happens: The Episode
Incredibly boring, not even 40 minutes long (without recap), those stupid sand snakes can apparently teleport now, Mel is a thousand year old monster or something when she takes the neclace of (which she already did before and nothing happened)

Why bother watching the rest of this season

Please George finish the books so I can rest in peace 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pfahahahaha, I'm sorry but this was laughable.

The entire season felt rushed, many battles were implied instead of shown(I'm guessing they ran out of money), an enormous amount of stuff felt like it was shoved in to surprise people but it just felt pathetic.

The mixup between murder porn scenes, which have reached an overload by this point, and much more reserved character scenes is abominable, you spend 20 minutes watching people getting murdered left and right and then you shift to samwell tarly and his awkward family reunions that don't even matter at all to the main storyline.

Besides the editing and time spent on characters vs time spent on axing people and things, good job on the return of forgotten characters like Osha, who honestly considering her screen time, really didn't need to come back, or pointless murders where the emotional element is completely absent.

I could count the number of ways in which this season was horrid, but I haven't got 500 000 characters, so let's just say this: it feels like a fanfiction. A really, really crappy fanfiction of GoT.

To illustrate, let me remind you of something and then spoil something new: In Season 1(or 2, or 3), when Cersei wanted to kill someone, she'd make sure for him to get too much to drink and get skewered by a boar, or she had them discreetly assassinated, poisoned, or better yet she maneuvered so her enemies would infight. The complexity of the intrigue was what made GoT exciting, fun and feel like a real cohesive world filled with tons of awesome characters.

Here, and this is spoilers, she literally shoves a regiment of wildfire caskets under the Great Sept, then blasts them with Tyrells, members of the small council, and the entire Faith Militant standing above, setting fire to a huge portion of the city, destroying the entire standing government, killing all the heirs of a great House, and essentially showing that she will go to any length of massacre to get away with her crimes. And you know the best? Right after committing arson, destruction of national monuments and mass slaughter, she crowns herself queen! How? On what legal basis? Apparently, the basis of having killed everyone else that could claim the throne or contest the claim in the city at that moment.

Spoilers end here, and I'm pretty sure that now, it's best for GoT to also end here. I have not seen a series this great fall this low in a long, long time, possibly ever. I sincerely hope that it ends quickly, because by now a generally awesome series is damaged completely beyond repair, and it was already bad in season 5. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Writing is way inferior to that for the previous five seasons. Convenient saves and seems like no one good ever stays dead. At this point I anticipate Robb and Lady Starke to come back from the dead. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never written a review, but I had to come out of the woodwork because my favorite TV show is dying a horrible death. I have started to call it A Dallas With Dragons to my friends.

Nothing is really wrong, per se, but just a little bit off. This whiff continues to grow with each episode since they introduced the Spain, sorry, Dorne timeline last season. No great monologues, witty insights, one liners - ok there are one liners, but that's all there seems to be these days. Gone are the days of spending 15 minutes with Jamie and Brienne in a sauna waxing lyrical on legacy.

Unfortunately, without Martin's books to quote directly from, the dialogue is cringe worthy at times. I am no expert, but I have seen seasons 1-3 about 5 times and the rest at least a couple. I also read the books (I admit I skimmed some points of views, but I got the gist) and noticed some dialogue was verbatim in the show.

I hope they sort out this cheesy dialogue problem and start allowing stories to breathe again, and relationships to build. They have killed off everyone I really liked, except of course Tyrion, so at least develop some interest in the remaining bozos. If they carry on like this soap opera, bouncing from on location to the next, I will honestly cry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The poorest aspect of the season are the dialogues, they are just terrible, especially if compared to the masterpieces of the first few seasons. Some of the characters seems to be doing things in completely random way just for the sake of making the show works. Side characters with little or no importance tend to have a huge attention (Blackfish for example) at the expenses of the time dedicated to the main plot to which they do no contribute in any way. The last two episodes were a bit better but only because something finally happened. Loved the soundtrack of the last episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It seems they will keep dragging the plots like season 5.
I only saw the first episode and, after last season, I'll assume they will somehow extend plots that should take 4 episodes into 8 then give an episode full of action and then 1 or 2 more episodes to wrap thing ups.
If for some reason I keep watching and things don't develop this way I'll update this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing. If this is the stuff that the average critic is finding good %73 as I write this. Then maybe it goes some way to explaining why TV generally seems to be a wasteland these days. To be honest I found it hard to watch. Actors had been chosen for their semblance to the original UK series and not for their acting ability. Most of the time it felt like they were reading from a script. Once again the US has (for some reason best known to itself) tried to copy a series that already existed instead of just showing the original. One again the US has totally failed to pull it off. Nevertheless there are worse things on TV than this, so I give it a 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What TV show were the critics watching? The original Life on Mars had actors who could actually act, chemistry, and style. This one just makes me want to avert my eyes. They tried to imitate the BBC version, but proved they didn't know what actually made the series a hit in the first place with their copy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holmes did not wow me; one is supposed to be mystified by his superior skills of deduction and intellect. Instead he frequently got things wrong, was difficult to understand, and did not live up to what Holmes is supposed to portray. I highly suggest BBC's "Sherlock" instead, it is much more captivating. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Elementary throws a gender bomb into Holmes and Watson and the result fizzles with tepid writing and a weak dynamic between the iconic pair. Johnny Lee Miller's Sherlock is a kept dillatante on the leash of his father at one end and the feminized Watson at the other. There is nothing interesting or mysterious about Holmes and his deductive talents are bragged about but seldom shown. Miller minces about while Liu rolls her eyes at his antics. This retelling brings change for its own sake with nothing else to offer. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Repetitive, slow and completely uninteresting. Too many questions, no answers. Unlikeable characters. This and the expanse have to be two of the worst shows on Television right now. At least Ash vs Evil Dead is exciting. I don't want to put to sleep, I want to be on the edge of my seat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After two episodes, this show seems to be about filling whole half-hour slots with awkwardness, frustration and callous indifference. Supposedly it's a comedy, but I don't know when that's supposed to kick in... not so much as a smirk yet. Unless your idea of comedy is watching people get frustrated by being brushed off by bigger systems than them as everything that can possibly go wrong does, I'd recommend you avoid it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is boring and so are the main characters. I only watch because of Mircea Monroe. The pilot is awful, I didn't laugh a single time. The season keeps getting better but the finale is still bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can not believe that this show is getting a better rating than Shameless. I am a loyal shotime original series fan, and this is the only show that they have put out that I absolutely do not like. It isn't that the acting is bad, or the character are unbelievable or anything like that. It is just that the storyline is very slow, and uses dated jokes. I could see how this would be a bigger hit on another station, but from the station that brought Weeds, Dexter, Shameless, Nurse Jackie, Californication etc, I had higher expectations. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Dreadful acting, vacuous script, the clothes are just too clean, the whites are white. The characters faces are clean and clear of disease, along with their hands, even the trash in the street is clean. During this time period  decades of dirt built up in the streets and the smell was horrendous, all day every day. Pointless faux sex, all over the place and as believable, as the modern day music, out of place and just plain bad. A second season? Don;t make me laugh. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A melodramatic, drawn out to the nth degree raping of the Terminator franchise. Sarah Connor's voice over narrations at the end of each episode are eerily similar to the Final Thoughts segment from The Jerry Springer Show. Bad in every way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved the first series give it a ten but this new series is ridiculous!! it has moved dramatically away from the book and has ruined the best character jason by turning him into just an idiot, a pure simpleton- no humour anymore. Bill is a sap and Sookie is simply irritating and she looks terrible with those weird curly bangs. Random sex scenes without any point - no lead up to them just in your face gross sex. All in all this series has just left me cringing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't understand how people liked this show. It felt like a 10 year old wrote the storyline. Here's a few od my observations. 1. US Government stores crucial data on a 90's Mac with in the form of "images" with NO backup. 2. The images were "downloaded" into Chuck's head by looking at them. 3. Computer drops and therefore the hard drives are totally destroyed with no way to retrieve the data. 4. He stops the bomb by going to a porno site that has a virus. Seriously, the bomb-controlling PC has internet access? Those are 4 of the reasons I can think of right now of why I won't be watching this show again. I generally love science fiction shows and was hoping this may be a better version of Jake 2.0, but I was very dissappointed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is an abomination. The only thing going for it is the title. My kids love the original, this stuff makes us all cringe. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are 2 David Lynchs and you often see both in one project. One is a creative narrative storyteller who draws intense performances from his actors and alternates relieves and heightens the mystery and tension in his work by speckling it with short bursts of deadpan absurdity and dreamworld horror. That's the good Lynch we see in Blue Velvet and TP season 1. The bad Lynch is a self indulgent pretentious spoiler of his narrative work to let you know he's dedicated to "art" rather than a finished work of integrity and ideas. The perfect example of this disunity is Mulholland Drive which nosedives from great heights midway through to disappear up its own posterior with a nasty message that (hollywood? life?) is nothing but shallow people using and trashing each other just as I, David Lynch, just used and trashed you, my audience, by despoiling the great story and characters i built in the first half of the film by saying it was all a dream or some other nonsense. Mulholland Drive and to a much greater extent in Lost Highway, which is weighted more to the bad side of Lynch's creativity, also display a disturbing aspect of Lynch which is his often over the top brutality towards his female characters which contrasts strongly with his ability to tenderly draw strong sympathetic and realistic female characters. This is a weird tendency but not in a good way like the moose head on table in a bank kind of weird. A perfect example of this is the short lived character Daria in TP season 3 who gets punched in the face twice (once wasn't enough to show bad Cooper is bad?) and then gets shot through a pillow. THEN Cooper lifts the pillow so we can enjoy seeing Daria is shot in the head (was there any doubt from inches away?). The latter is just one example of how the show follows the bad tendency of the TP movie to shift too far into darkness without a sympathetic hook for the viewer to take that dark trip in any enjoyable way. Comic relief is also absent. Lovable goofy characters like Andy and Lucy seem to be jarringly brain damaged, maybe inhabited by spirits from a Dumb Lodge we'll find out about later? The pacing and delivery of the few "funny" scenes with both the old and new characters like the forgetful neighbor of the murdered woman is way off and the jokes go over like lead balloons. Even the pacing of interesting scenes like the photo box in NYC is way too slow and milks the tension from it. But it's hard to complain about episodes 1 and 2's flaws when we get to the unremitting boring nonsense that is episodes 3 and 4. While Albert has a few funny quips in these, they are almost hard to latch onto amidst the numbing tone of these episodes which are not leavened by music or some other aid this weak material sorely needs. I think any fan of TP's first season was excited by the news months ago that the original 9 hour run of this season was being lengthened to 18 hours, but based on these four episodes, we could be in for an exhausting 9 hours of ponderous noodling with bad special effects to balance out 9 hours of narrative storytelling. I'll keep watching to see if good Lynch winds but i'm not hopeful based on what we have seen so far.
Having just watched the 5th episode, the prospects of recovery for this show seem even dimmer. Cooper continues to impersonate Dougie and his family, friends, and now co-workers are all taken in by the impersonation even though his speech is restricted to one or two word repetition of whatever is spoken to him. In the real world or an artistic one of integrity, all of these people would have driven Dougie to a hospital to investigate his serious cognitive dysfunction. This is not absurdist, it's just bad lazy writing that maybe could be excused if it was a one scene transition for Cooper, but can't be for 3 ungodly boring episodes of such drivel. What makes it worse is that one can easily see how very funny it would be to see Cooper having to impersonate a slacker like Dougie to find his way back into the world, but, you know, that would require Frost/Lynch to actually write some interesting dialogue and it's apparently 25 years too late for that. The lack of any creative effort in some scenes is often stupefying, e.g.  Sheriff Truman's brother talks to his wife about a water leak in as mundane terms as you could hear riding a bus and then the scene ends. Later, a boy sees an object under a car that causes it to blow up. The jump cut from the object to the car in flames seems borrowed from a no budget straight to video film and the boy is mere feet away unharmed by flying glass, etc. If there were still newspapers around with wide audiences who paid critics to write literate reviews, this show would be rightfully vilified as junk patched together by 2 guys coasting off their prior reputations to cash in.

I loved the original Twin Peaks from the first 5 minutes of the pilot to a title bit into Season 2, when it went from being perfect to just better-than-average TV with characters I loved.  It did NOT take 5 episodes before it started to get good.

Season 3 is unfathomably bad.  Sure, I don't know what Lynch's master plan is, but I CAN see horribly written dialog, failed attempts to recapture the spirits of old characters, scenes that are 2 to 5 times too long (and not in the good way David Lynch used to do).  I started each of the first 4 episodes with my fingers crossed that it would be where some of the old magic returns.  But after about 4 hours, the only bit of the old magic I saw were parts of the glass box thread and a new motorcycling character (not James).

Maybe a miracle will occur in the remaining episodes but I feel more and more like a sucker for watching the first 4... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Soap on a submarine. More or less it is not. Sure, the action is good in itself but who wrote this dialogue? Rarely have I heard such a meaningless stuff.
The actors show no luster performances and the story is stupid.
That the series was canceled after 13 episodes is not surprising. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The people who experienced the movie during the era it came out are the only ones that stand to have a solid opinion on the series. I'm in my mid 30's and the movie when it came out was a way of life and influenced the direction of your social life practically. With that said, the series is exactly what I expected it be. A dull empty redux of an iconic film created by young aggressive alternative comedic geniuses in the creative prime of their lives. Who brought with them, enough fresh untapped groundbreaking material to sink a cargo ship. Now why the very same people would come back 14 years later with nothing left but their hat in their hands material wise and attempt to fill a series with it, is a question that can be asked of most movie/series reboots these days. The formula is always the same. Young talent dumps life's blood into master work. Master work soars. Talent gets old, rich, and bored. What is born, is Wet Hot American snore. The series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first episode is fine but it goes downhill and it goes downhill fast. Seems like they decided to choose weird over funny in the hopes that the viewer couldn't tell the difference. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 4 finale was the worst.  This season started out slow and weird (baby bathtub scene, Carrie doing a young boy to get Intel out of him) then picked up considerably with the spy stuff in Islamabad....then the season 4 finale got delivered in a stinking paper bag to us on our door step. Awful, just awful.  I was in shock at this finale - incredibly boring, slow, new plot avenues (The absent mother of 15 years), no resolution with Quinn.  I am incredibly pissed at this team of writers but even more mad at the executive team that said " yes, this is great writing - lets go with it". did they even review it?  Did the full time writers take a vacation and let the interns write the last episode.  Wtf. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry couldn't get past the first episode. I stopped at the scene at the house where she finds her husband strapped in a chair with tape. Right from the trailer, i already decided I didn't like this show and wasn't going to watch but my friend convinced me to. I think this show is too dramatic, but that would not be a problem if the acting was able to rise to occasion. the scene where she finds her husband captured in the house was just too bad. Shows like this piss me off: Reminds me of "The Following". Find a very dramatic plot-line but don't bother finding actors who can convincingly carry out the plot line and don't bother making the show as realistic as possible tone-wise and plot-wise. This show is for people who just want cheap entertainment and don't want to think or reason as they watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the worse shows I've had to endure in recent memory, abysmal acting, James Spade has hit a new low, with his one expression act he's got going on. I'm not sure how many times they can make samey shows while keeping us interested.
A fast paced mess, with a lot of "blabla" trying too hard to sound intelligent and gripping while almost parodying the genre. I am a one man army, boom bam Hu Ha I'll say two words and make you crack, Ill defuse the bomb the last second, I got the president on speed dial. BORING.
Tis' a poor man's 24,only two decades late and as dull and cliché as they get. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I admit to a huge Spader crush and that could be why I think he is the only thing worth watching on this show.. but the other characters are just plain boring.  Pretty, yes but about as exciting and compelling as old ketchup.  Not to mention, quite stupid, honestly.  In this show, the FBI is barely functioning above a 6th grade logic skills class and while it's satisfying to get some of the answers before the main characters, we shouldn't be getting ALL of them.
(POSS. SPOILER AHEAD..)  Agent Keen is most likely his abandoned daughter from 20 years ago when he went AWOL.  It's super obvious right in the pilot.  The only people who don't see this are... everyone else in the story!  Which is to say, all the FBI agents.  All of whom have been recruited during the same 20 year lag where walking while talking meant you had the right stuff to be in the FBI.  I am serious, they are just not that bright.  Nest to James Spader's main attraction, they just don't live up to his creepy mystery and everyone else comes across as plain and dull next to him.   Agent Keen, his daughter, is very pretty and dull.  Agent Keen's begrudging partner is also pretty and dull as block-of-wood Agent Ressler  ('cause she 'wrestles' with him, get it.. they love the obvious on this show)
Since episode 1, it would seem that Keen's only acting directions must have been, "have no expression on your face, then at random moments, face the camera and cry...ok, go!"   I don't know whether it's the writing or the directing but no one aside from Spader's character is even remotely interesting.  Spader is the best part of the show, along with the always wonderful Parminder Nagra who makes the most out of terrible lines and almost no part.   Which ultimately is a shame because I think the premise is quite good. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Has the potential to be great, BUT it sadly looks like it will not live up to it's potential. Conceptually, it is great,  but the writing is terrible, nonsensical, and illogical. All the problems are too easily solved by Spader's character, the FBI is portrayed as one big idiot as everyone seems to be out of the loop. Spader's outfit in the opening? WOOF. It was offensively cheesy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I waited with review to second episode, and well...
Scenario is so stupid, i cant watch more than 5 min per session. Every armed man must run without shoot into our agents, bandits have superuper-pistols  they can shoot off pyramid with. Or at least shake it :D
i will not  give another examples, but this serie is for total idiots no more than 12 years old. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show gets more disappointing with every episode. My take  let's say you give Avengers 100 out of 100. This show is just like the Avengers  oh but with a bunch of dimwit gen-y actors (-15 points) minus the budget (-15) minus the script (-10), minus a plot (-20). And even making Clark Gregg into a douche (-20!). 100  80  20 out of 100  yeah, that's about right.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So Agent Coulson's day job is palling around with a Scooby gang of inexperienced twenty somethings?  Seriously?  After building up the Marvel universe to an epic scale in the movies, they've diminished the hell out of it with this series.  We could've maybe had an ACTUAL Whedon series instead of this thing.  With actual characters, humor and edge.  But idiots would rather watch this bland crap than Firefly, Angel, or-- pick your own Whedon IP that ended before its time.  They were all better.
This is why we can't have nice things. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Probably one of the worst pilots since i bothered to sit down and watch Future Diary, 3/10 **** **** id recommend watching another tv show Superhero related for example the Arrow, better characters and a deeper story line 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had such high hopes for this show, but all it does is disappoint. Coulson is interesting enough, but the rest of the cast is terribly bland and obnoxious, and everything they do feels boring and inconsequential. It feels like Marvel crossed with NCIS, but minus all the cool fight scenes or any of the great super heroes that make Marvel... Marvel. SHIELD in the comics rely on super heroes, even if they are their own organization, and this just showed how strained the story is when you replace rich, fleshed out characters with bland stereotypes without any real, multifaceted personalities. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

After a full season, I believed I had given Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D enough of a chance. I am a fan of the comics and the movies, but Marvel let me down on this show. After watching the new season's premier, I can say for sure that I'm not sold on it and will stop watching. The DC shows are looking to be building up to more. My primary complaints on SHIELD are the poor acting, the slow story, the editing and just the script in general. It's underwhelming, especially when compared to the Marvel film universe. I like how they tied the plot into Captain America 2 a bit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is a cheap way to capitalize on The Avengers. All the positive reviews came after the pilot, which I'll admit was pretty good, but the show slowly got worse and worse until it ended up being like Lost, too drawn out and boring, and I'm just talking about season 1. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching T Avengers and then watching this is like one day eating lobster and then the next day eating a 99p microwaveable fish pie. Completely let down by its Hammy dialogue and un-engaging characters. Hard to believe this was made by Joss Whedon. What a disappointment. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this show, but it reminds me of Terra Nova. A lot of promise, but never delivers and instead has a cheesy plot line, poor CGI, bad acting and limited presence of what people thought they would see. In the case of Terra Nova, people wanted to see dinosaurs. In AOS, people are expecting to see B-line superheroes and villians....instead we get a mis-matched group of nobodies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Coulson is OK, but compared to the rest of the characters he is dazzling. The others are dull and many of them overact to an annoying degree, particularly the hacker. It is really off-putting. Furthermore, they seem to use the Warehouse 13 method of Unexplained Devices. That is, they have devices that can put the characters in jeopardy, but they never bother to explain where the devices come from or why they are there--not a single spec of back story. OK, I may be wrong about this, as I didn't finish watching the second episode because I was so bored. But if they did use the Unexplained (or barely explained) Devices method, then it is lazy writing that leaves viewers unsatisfied. I hope they don't continue in this vein. Also, how old are most of these characters? Twelve? Let's have some variety in race, age, and looks. Everybody doesn't have to be pretty. I expected more from Whedon. I thought the Avengers film was very good and I never watch that type of film. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had such high hopes for this series. The books were good, although a little "light" on storyline.
The first season of Trueblood was pretty good. I could even handle when they made Tara black and working in the bar, Lafayette didn't get killed, and other deviations from the story line---to some extent.
Then things got a little over the top with the sick goriness of the Maynaad. Then a little more with last seasons witch, really what the heck was that. Now this season----this is disgusting. The writers seem to have no imagination with this Lilith and only want to shock with blood and disgusting behavior.
This series is sinking FAST.

If you want to save it, return somewhat to the story line. We want the STORY !!!!!
Throw a little romance back in. Possibly bring in the were tiger. Bring back some of Sookie's family relational issues. Focus on the things that made the books so popular.

This is disgusting. I can't believe the author ""sold out" like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This Show is based off a really good series of books. Season one was fantastic in sticking to the storyline. Now 4 seasons later in season 5 i use the therm "based" loosely. The Series has strayed from the original storyline and flew off in it's own direction. I'm NOT happy about it and don't wish to continue watching something that has gone so far from the original story. If you have seen the show but not read the books,  don't read past book one. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Where do I begin? I have watched every episode in fascination because I can't figure out what the creators are trying to put across. Amy has a severe personality disorder and has no redeeming qualities at all. She treats everyone horribly and has no self awareness. I could rant about the unbelievable situations, but of course many dramas have serious reality gaps. However this show abounds in unreality. To name a few....how did she get her original job in the first place, who in their right mind would have an office fling with her, what kind of company moves a mentally ill person into another job especially in IT! Who paid for Luke's character's rehab in Hawaii. Has there ever been a more isolated person?....without one friend in the world. No, Luke's character doesn't count. Why would Christa's family let Amy within 100 feet of her? What CEO offers a $100,000 job to a person who was kicked downstairs due to obvious and serious flaws? And on and on. But more confusing to me is this. It seems that Amy is the hero, and she's the most unlikable character. Somehow she gets people to do her bidding quite easily. So she's really quite powerful, all while striking the mouth agape pose which I guess signifies her naivete. She seems to lack social skills, but add to that a complete lack of compassion or sensitivity to anyone, her mother, Christa, Tyler, anyone really. So, she's a heartless dork, bumbling successfully through a successful takedown of the company. Her voiceovers about love and light ring so hollow because we never see her bringing love or light to any situation. Are we making fun of whistle blowers and New Age types? Are we supposed to be laughing at people with personality disorders? I am also amazed at how loved this show is. What am I not seeing? I know there is no accounting for tastes, but the only negative reviews I can find are from viewers. I can't find one professional reviewer with negative comments. They all gush. I feel like I'm watching a different show. I love HBO, but I give this show the absolute worst rating in terms of plot, message, character development, and entertainment value. Actually, it entertains me by its flaws as I try to figure out WTF. It's the show I love to hate. What am I missing?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Oh, where do I begin? I have been asked to check the spoiler box if this review contains any spoilers. Given that nothing worth mentioning has happened in Enlightened, it'd be hard to write a spoiler. A woman has a nervous breakdown, and goes to some kind of rehab, and then comes back to her old workplace. She gets shafted and they give her a  job in the hope that she moves out. Not bad, right? Yeah, well, that's all that's happened. She just sits around at her desk trying to convince people to support new age crap about meditation, as well as women's groups and other things. This show is so bland it hurts. And who ever called it a comedy-drama? There is more comedy in The Sopranos. There really is. I would have given this show 0, but I feel sorry for Mike White, who has to sit around looking sad all the time, and also because Luke Wilson made me laugh once. This show is  crap. Steer well clear. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The Script is little more than writing for shock value with a little sex thrown in here and there so it can be watchable by men.  Debauchery.  A little more realistic writing would be nice.  Every scene does not need to involve abuse or blood. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Extraordinarily average. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The fact that this show can get such high reviews is a sad indication of the bleak landscape that is television comedy today. The only reason I haven't given this show a zero, is because the second season seems to have balanced the black comedy cliches with the blatant white pandering to a more tolerable level. Anyone who believes it is "racist" to compare this show with Chapelle's Show is simply naive. Comedy Central has been trying to recapture the success of Chapelle's Show since Chapelle left, and this is simply the most successful yet. Most were such failures that you were never even aware they existed. David Allen Greer, enough said. While the sketches are convoluted, and giggle inducing at best, the real weakness in this show are the awkward and forced "comedy" bits in between. The hosts seem a bit more natural in delivery during the second season, but the material is still far from original or funny. One of the reasons Chapelle found such success was his attitude. He made sketches because he liked them and thought they were funny, the show was just an outlet. The same with Tosh.0, Comedy Centrals only other original success in recent history. Everything Key and Peele do seems forced and the sketches are marketed to the lowest common denominator, using race related material as a crutch rather than a tool of innovation.
Unfortunately, I don't see this show going anywhere in the near future. If one day a sketch comedy can show half as much potential as Chapelle's show, this will be seen for the mediocre culture parody it is and will finally be rendered obsolete by actual competition. We can only hope.

Very mediocre, 3 out of 10 episodes were really worth the time to watch. Raimi would be smart to take this show over and bring his magic back to the franchise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching all these annoying people constantly whine and bicker was like fingernails on a chalkboard.  I really tried but after three episodes I had to turn it off. Everyone did a fine job but I hated all the characters and the the whole sweaty, dysfunctional family. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has plot and logic holes big enough to drive the truck she destroys through.  The writers don't even seem to have a basic grasp of "Kryptonian" powers and abilities.  They need to go back and study the basics.

Now Melissa and Mehcad were good in their roles.  When they are on screen the shows is quite watchable.  The biggest problem for Melissa is her fight scenes.  The fight choreography just do not flow.  If they are going for her fighting to be geeky and horribly awkward then they succeeded.  There needs to be some serious work on that.  She needs training.  Mehcad needs to assume a more mentor like role.  I know it was only episode one, but his character needs to be used better.

Ok, some of my pet peeves and problems.

First, Kara's "sister" never says thank you for saving her life.  That is kind of a big thing.  Maybe it ended up on the cutting room floor, but maybe not.  With these writers and script editors you never know.  They need to work on the character relationships.  Maybe it is just me but I would say "Thank You" to the person who saved my life.

Second is Kara's capture.  As Kara is flying through the city and she is mysteriously shot with two kryptonite knock out darts from nowhere by unseen mystery snipers.  She wakes up in her "sisters" secret government lab in kryptonite restraints.  Surprise, sis works for the feds.  Her job, you guessed it,  studying aliens.  The lab/agency director is deliberately rude and demeaning to Kara.  What a great way to establish a relationship to help base the show on.  Piss off the alien with god like power.  Hey, I know.  How about you have the "sister" try something like asking Kara to come with her to meet some people she knows?  These scenes with the government people were just so badly written.

Third, the other aliens.  Oh, did I forget to mention that there are hundreds if not thousands of criminal aliens living on earth?  All of them are from Krypton's maximum security prison.  They have been on earth as long as Kara has.  The government knows they are here but has done nothing but observe.

I could go one but I think you have gotten the point by now.  I hope they try to save the series as there is potential but it is going to take some serious work and probably an entirely new writing staff. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Supergirl's foster sister is a secret government agent for a secret agency whose lead agent sets a trap for Supergirl(who has no knowledge of this secret agency)  then kidnaps and imprisons her all to tell Supergirl that he doesn't trust her and doesn't want an alien to join his secret agency. Supergirl then immediately goes about performing the agency's work for them.

I wish I were making this up.
That about sums up the quality of Supergirl 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow! I don't know what to say. The professional critics gave this show a 75? Krypton had a society that was technically and intellectually far advanced to Earth. Kara (Supergirl) acts like an air headed valley girl. She knows nothing! How in the world did she ever land a job ? You have a plane on fire and falling from the sky and Superman doesn't even show up? Are you kidding? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Two words; painful pandering (take that Stan Lee). Clearly the network and writers have no skill if they have to stoop to demagoguery. Poor DC has really fallen and I almost feel like they will become irrelevant in the next decade for the damage they have done to their properties. I really did not like the Supergirl pilot episode which is too bad because i like several of the actors. But seriously, why do you need to pander? I know the old television networks are faltering pretty hard (despite their public denial of the fact) due to internet revelry but are they really so desperate that they need to find viewership this way? How about you stop the cronyism and look for talented writers instead? There are tons out of there and they will all work for peanuts just to have a chance at writing for a major network broadcast show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show stinks. Royally. The pilot is a non-stop, poorly scripted bullet train of trash. An entire season's worth of story, character developing, suspense building, etc, is crammed into one 43 minute long episode and there is just nothing to grab you as it all flies by so fast.

-The Supergirl in question flip flops more than the footwear of the same name between what she should or shouldn't do.
-The flip flopping in question pretty much occurs between each scene.
-Characters are introduced far too quick.
-Powerful/big secrets revealed like they're nothing more than an admission to having a naughty snack while dieting.
-The initial villain is about as threatening as his hackneyed dialogue.
-Familiar DC secondary character is introduced and reduced to a go-between as apparently Superman can't be bothered to pick up the phone and chat to his cousin.
-Characters have about as much depth as the plot (i.e. a puddle).
-Fight scenes are... awkward.

We're in the postmodern period; we want depth, intelligence, believable characters and actions, we want turmoil, we want a powerful female figure and this delivers none of these. This show is great for a toddler as it has the flashy, flying superhero stuff but very, very little other substance.

Several other reviewers seem to be offended by this on a political level saying that it's some sort of PC, social justice warrior, liberal agenda propaganda... These people must be the type of conservatives who'll take offence and cry/scream/rant at the perceived "lack" of moral character of hand holding by an unmarried couple because there is nothing of the sort in this except an abundance of female characters. In its favour, it could easily have been an over the top, forced piece of social commentary but it's really not; it seriously lacks the depth to explore these issues as it doesn't even have the depth to explore the characters beyond trite, 2D, forgettable ones. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Just saw Supergirl up to Season 1, Episode 9.  The messages seem to suggest the bad guys are the ones who care about the destruction of the planet, or who care about corrupt politicians.  WTF??  What kinds of messages are these to send to impressionable viewers?

The stunning lack of any reason for the conflict between Supergirl and the Kryptonion expatriates feels very phony and contrived.  It feels like two-dimensional bad guys created just for conflict, with no rational reasons for their behavior; just some vague notion of saving the world, which we're supposed to assume is bad.

The fundamental conflicts on this show are poorly conceived and the show is very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The sexism of this show is drastic, men are evil except the friend-zoned male feminist and the adonis race-swapped Jimmy Olsen that makes supergirl lose her ****  Woman must empower themselves and it is certainly hard for someone with powers like a greek god to empower themself.  It seems if you are a man you should learn your place and realize that entertainment is demonizing you unless you fit into one the pre-selected victim categories of the modern gender studies crowd.  This show's audience is teenage girls who spend more time on their phones than comic book crowds spend with comics but that should be enough to get a season 2 as even super girl is now a victim and men must flock to watch this horrible writing  to support the cause.

The fight scenes are not even enjoyable and feel static.  Convenient writing makes the fights and the story hard to get into.  Super krypton sniper darts, FTW!  Government clandestine agencies must have already infiltrated the remains of krypton.  The enemies (when you see it) are laughable and convenient.

Even with the horrible cramming of political ideology down our throats it would have been fun if just a little of the show was focused on entertainment and gaining an audience.

I am surprised that supergirl was not gender swapped or made one of the new genders, as it seems progressive writers have no originality to create new and unique entertainment that is enjoyable for anyone except the extreme radicals.  Too bad, was hoping for some more Super Man/Girl since Smallville has been off TV but I don't want to be patronized.  2 points for the nun-outfit version of supergirl.  If you are going to take focus off your hero thats the way to do it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Benoist is certainly charming enough in her gauche alter ego, but can't hack the action scenes. But the scriptwriters should be in hiding, this is witless, cliche ridden, lacks dramatic structure and the dialogue is pure soap opera cheese. Terrible.
Any series that opens with an episode where the highlight is ' you can do it! I believe in you!' is bound to be pretty bad.
Can NOT buy into Jimmy Olsen as a hunky romantic lead. The other guy who is supposed to fancy - so unmemorable I don't think his name even registered in 3 episodes, is more nearly a Jimmy character, if it wasn't for the fact he appears to be the stereotype camp gay BFF.
So fed fed up with little romantic soap operas for newly emerged teens. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm not even sure where to begin, surprisingly enough the production seems cheap in the daytime there seems to be this terrible light filter. The nights are dark, and gray. Where is the HD? But let me get on to the serious issues, I was excited about this show cause I don't know anything about supergirl. What do I find in this series? Superman is some mastermind who helps her into becoming a hero from behind the scenes, not to mention all the references and comparisons to him. I expected to find an independent strong main character. But instead she will be comparing all her failures to supermans successes, for the next entire season. If this series was tied into Arrow and The Flash, it could have used metahuman antagonists but instead its some other terrible continuity with a bunch of alien escapees, I would rather watch Ben 10. Her entire support team emerges in the first episode, which would have been better portrayed over multiple episodes. This thing is just altogether terrible, I hope it dies quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

wait what...seriously!!! ... no one seems to match the face between supergirl switching from her everyday look. not even her boss when they meet each other almost everyday. not even when she is standing next to a giant poster of supergirl. is world became that blind?  Does she go for a make up run before flying to attend emergency life threatening situations? may be clark kent has got way with this just because it was not past 2014. but seriously i do not find it comforting above all the plot holes, lame dialogues and action scenes. I was waiting with popcorn ready to microwave since i heard of this show coming. but i have lost my appetite. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I feel like I am missing something when I see any positive reviews. The 2 I will give this is for the cast, they are likable and are doing their best with the horrendous writing but I will be amazed if it doesn't get cancelled after this season.
I wish they gave us a stronger female orientated superhero show. This spectacular failure makes me more exited about Jessica Jones (Although with critics rating Supergirl so high, I can't help but wonder if they are just afraid to blast a female fronted superhero show just in case they stop making them) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Note: this is from a guy's PoV. This show is about mommies of young 'uns, so I'm not the target demo. Still, it's so steeped in "momminess" that it can't even qualify as a guilty pleasure. As such, it's just repulsive, for guys, so don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Shallow Story Line,  and Shallow Lives.    And no 6 year old would have the music taste of a 50 year old man.  The murder suspense is a cheap trick to keep the viewer engaged, yet doesn't work for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rich White People Problems. Ocean front mansions. Pettiness. Spoiled precocious kids. Overacting. Overreacting. Nic Kidman doesn't look a day over 30 (thanks to Botox & Juvederm). Keep waiting for Witherspoon, as she's sipping her white wine, to look at the camera and say "Don't you know who I am?!" Keep waiting for Skarsgard to take his shirt off. Kravitz is the "exotic" addition who sticks out like a sore thumb "Why am I here?" Woodley is the only character that's keeping me watching out of curiosity...not sure I can take much more of this show.

I am so disappointed in this version that I hardly know where to begin. Jane's childhood and time at Lowood are raced through at such a frantic pace that there's no time for character development. The production adds things that never happened , changes those that did, and dwells on the relatively unimportant (Rochester's affair with the Adele's mother) at the expense of the more crucial events. Dialogue is "updated" and watered-down, and neither of the main characters resembles Bronte's description. This is not at all a "faithful retelling." Viewers' time would be better spent going back to the Timothy Dalton version or, better yet, reading the book. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This tired, derivative, same old same old clone with a new twist on a done to death genre could have been good if it wasn't so phony and downright sleazy.  Making it so much worse is the cast of absolutely abhorrent scumbag freak show characters.  Start with the ugly, sailor mouth, sickeningly overblown Boston accented red head wife.  What an annoying shrill shrieking shrew!  They cast a deformity as the daughter.  Then you have the hideous fat dyke for a mistress to the gym owner brother cast by a dwarf out of something like "Lord of the Rings".  Of course there's the token profane beyond real(even in Hollywood they aren't quite this over-the-top, except for maybe cable TV execs) shouting balding elfin Jew lawyer/agent? who is the little rabid dog that's all bark and no bite.  And then the two miserable leads... An Eastern Euro descended chipmunk who is a good actor but has no charisma.  He plays tough sure with the unshaven look and no nonsense disposition and he is a big guy.  That's all it takes these days?  Remember somebody like Steve McQueen?
Worst of all is the disgrace of a solid veteran like Jon Voight playing not only a reprehensible evil mobster, sure I can see why he'd take that role, but a filthy perverted heinous freak of one?  It's twisted beyond any measure of suspension of disbelief!  Maybe he's not aware of what a goofy not very scary clown he's playing?  If this is what an actor of stature has to do to regain notoriety and a paycheck then it's no better than flat out prostitution (which actually most all actors are fully game for sadly and they continually prove it).  For that matter Eliot Gould should have remained in semi-retirement.  Now he has this hideous blemish to haunt him.
Most of all, the scumbag Showtime execs behind this filth should be held accountable for the debasing of society.  Guess what cable whores?  People, including hot young actresses, generally do not use the phraseology "F--- me", "I want to taste you…" etc. constantly.  Even in Hollywood there is some discretion at times.  In this sordid show every character uses this kind of language all the time.  It's a sick false way of life as depicted.
No, it's only the dweeb druggie sex obsessed writers, producers and execs of these kind of shows that think people talk and act this way.  You see they don't get it in their real lives, so they openly fantasize about it here which sadly does in turn have a debased effect on the culture.  They aren't stupid though, they know that human nature is such that curiosity gets the best of us and we watch.  Sex and violence sells.  It doesn't take more than the barrel of monkeys making this **** to pull that off.  I'm done after six episodes not only because of all this rant on depravity.  No it's mostly because the show is phony poorly written trash.
It's light years from "Breaking Bad" or "Goodfellas" or even "Michael Clayton" which it tries to rip off. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I would rather have watched a Lifetime movie. Seriously this is corny, unbelievable and unbelievably silly. That's all good, but now when it's pretending to something more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first episode was terrible. Hannibal Buress was the only bright spot in the entire thing. Just brutal, unfunny television. Can't imagine going back for episode two. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show seems to be promoted by a bunch of bloggers who can't shut up about how much they "love it" but it's really not very good at all.  Hipster's aren't especially interesting at all as a subculture and at this point gen-z is replacing the millennials anyway.  It's unclear if they are acting like loathsome hipsters or if they are just hipster's who everyone hates, but if they're being ironic they may be too good for their own good. If they are just being mean-spirited I can't see why that's especially funny either. That's more like elitism from the pov of a corporate shill. Illana is raunchy and Abbi is the straight man and it's just a bunch of zany gags. It's no different from any of other show on cable who's primary purpose is to sell air time to vendor's. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although the actors try, their efforts are undermined by improbable plot twists and plodding script that is far below the standards of British Television. (See State of Play, The Hour, MI-5.) The premise that an elderly spy would still be pursued thirty or so years after WWII is tenuous. Moreover, the story lacks relevance for our time. Those craving 1940's ambiance would be better off watching the Third Man, Maltese Falcon, etc. for a second, third or fourth time rather than wasting their time on Restless. If you hanker after British spy craft, then watch MI-5 (Spooks in the UK) or see the latest Bond flick. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Should be renamed Studio Sucky. I can't believe that this show would retain its market share audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm pretty sure this was sorkin's punishment for west wing. you'll probably enjoy this if you are thirty-something female who believes in fairies or will watch anything with 'angel' in the title. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can't believe all the positive reviews I'm reading. Has everyone gone insane? This show is terrible!!! Yes, the cast is great, but the show is BORING. And confusing. And the mystery sketch is "Crazy Christians"? Wow. Swing and a miss. Open your eyes, people! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I suffered through this show twice. It is terrible. What show were the critics watching?? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too obvious in showing its agenda. The acting was good, but it came across too preachy. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was prepared to love this show. I looked forward to it more than I have to any show in a long time. By episode three, I found my attraction has turned to complete aversion. It's not that I don't 'get' the TV setting and in jokes. Being on the fringe of the business, I don't find them out of reach at all. For the most part it's that Sorkin has once again chosen TV as his pulpit. The sanctimonious attitude he shows towards anyone who may not share his political and moral beliefs is inexcusable. I can listen to people who disagree with me, I can appreciate other opinions, but to be incessantly pepperred with statements that imply I am stupid and ignorant for what I believe is not going to make me watch this show. It's just not good enough. Add to this some truly ridiculous conceits and the score I can give this drops even lower. Question. When was the last time Saturday Night Live was remotely intellectual, highbrow, intriguing, cutting edge, or even -funny-? I can't remember either. And yet here we are, presented with a show within a show that we are supposed to believe is all these things? I did -so- enjoy the scenes where the producers/writers/various others were discussing how the audience just didn't 'get' the skits. It was charming when Amanda Peet's character insulted the focus group, that really impressed me. Yes, Studio 60, a show based on SNL, is supposedly intellectual entertainment folks. Only smart, savvy people can understand it. Sorkin, you're such a blowhard. Your agenda is as greasy and obvious as a 16 year old pizza boy's oily face. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Old, trite, pretentous. The professional critics are in love with the sound of their own voices. This is a show that acts as if the rise and fall of a late night comedy is the equivalent of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. It's a lot of strum and drang about nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Yet another episode of "Left-WIng Hypocrites Can Save the World." The show includes a "Christian" character just so she can be the recipient of scathing put-downs from the Matthew Perry character. Can't wait till Sorkin introduces a Demonic Republican character, too. Just give the show an Emmy now! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So I gave this more than a fair shot - what is it now, 4 or 5 weeks? But I'm cutting the line on this one. Never watched West Wing, but did like the American President and occassionally watched Sports Night (though when I did watch it it was ages ago and I think it went over my head). I do like the look of it and I congratulate Matthew Perry for stepping out and doing a great job with a new character. If nothing else I hope this opens up a lot of doors to him. But: 1) It's a skit show - attemping to cram all the posturing and seriousness of government into a comedy show strains your credulity. 2) "Crazy Christians" - ok really, this is to Sorkin what...courage? Attacking a group who a) probably won't watch the show and b) won't really get upset (boycott? - do those even work anymore (ala Disney and the Southern Baptists)). How about courage to attack another religion in which protests result in actual violence (not saying he should but if his point is how "courageous" he is). It seems every episode is only a way for you to get to the "Christian Right" joke or issue. ("How high do my ratings need to stay up so I can go after the Right" - really that would be Peet's concern? - how about she'd be more concerned because her job might be over if she doesn't.) 3) Fast talk - the fact someone talks fast does not inherently mean what you are saying is well written. Not having watched WW I have to only conclude this is a a style of Sorkin's. If you actually pause to listen to what the characters are saying you realize the writing is quite bland, pretentious, and sometimes downright poor. 4) Out of Touch - Honestly this is the key issue this might work if Sorkin tried to actually attach his character's to real issues. This feels like someone "preaching to the choir" (an anology that I'm sure Sorkin wouldn't like) and thus undercuts the "cutting-edge" meliu that he is supposed to represent. Sadly it seems only South Park actually keeps up the ideas of being on the cutting edge and skewing everything from Jesus to Hybrid owners to Scientology. This feels like Sorkin is trying to reclaim some past glory by reveling in liberal pathos and some mystical past where people actually had to fear the religious right. That's the probelm at root - if your only issue to be "relevant" is a strawman - well you aren't the courageous/intelligent/hard-hitting/well-written show that you claim to be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I keep hearing that you either love or hate her comedy.

Well... for me she does neither. I don't get outraged at her adolescent vulgarity, nor do I find it funny. I'm completely unimpressed at her attempts at cleverness. I watched We Are Miracles last night. Maybe I smiled once or twice and that's about it.

It left me a little bored, uninterested and without anything to reflect on. Like plain white bread with nothing on it. Tasteless, fills you up while you eat it, no nutritious value what so ever.

Too bad. I really wanted to like it. I like her when she's not scripted, but that show... just nahhh... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. I've never watched Sarah Silverman's stand-up, though I've heard she's the kind of person you either love or hate. Well, it seemed like everyone in the club absolutely adored her, as they were essentially laughing at everything she said, joke or otherwise. I on the other hand chuckled once, and cringed for the remaining thirty minutes I subjected myself too. This woman just does not appeal to my sense of humor. She's filthy but not clever, a fatal combination. If you're like me, watch Bill Burr's new special on Netflix. That man knows how to tell a freaking joke. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A extremely stiff delivery and same old stuff, dead babies, Jews killed Jesus   her self adulation of her own breasts. I'm surprised they could find 39 people that brain dead to find her funny...but hey it is LA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have never met a bunch of whiny, self loathing characters in my life on one tv show. The only ones I can watch are the nurse, reporter, and the lawyer for Fisk. I just can't sit through this show. Foggy and the secretary have got to go, especially Foggy. I never saw so much self-righteous indignation in my life. The shows premise is good but I just can't watch the characters. Thanks! St. Francis 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first 5 minutes is someone getting dressed! After that the excitement never stops. Very drawn out dull show. The overuse of music in every scene actual drowns out the voices... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show gets progressively worse every season. Season 4 is just a re-hash of season 3. "Oh no, its the Governor... again! This time he's got another group of survivors to assault the prison... again. Wow! Didn't see that coming!" Honestly, it is like having your death star blown up by a group of teenagers, so you decide to make the same mistake, but this time with a bigger death star (now they have a tank from Vietnam oooOOOOoooo   with the same disastrous results). Season 4 is so bad, it is as if another writers' strike is in progress. Honestly, it is most likely just excessive meddling by AMC executives with the storyline, as we've seen with season 2. This show is ridiculously unrealistic  yes, I know, ignoring the zombies  it is clear that the show creators have no idea how guns actually work. For example, in Season 3, Glenn and Maggie somehow manage to miss a group of people assaulting the prison, who are lined up in an alley way, while in a guard tower. Add to the fact that bullets are stopped by plywood, filing cabinets and tables... right. This show is low budget, predictable, boring and frankly insulting to anyone with an iota of common sense. But hey  the people giving this show high ratings speak for themselves. They are the ignorant masses who eat up this garbage like mindless zombies. Oh yeah, I also hate the split seasons  a pathetic way to try and keep interesting going year round. Really just a giant finger from the AMC executives to their sycophantic fans. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Loved seasons 1-3, unexpected thrills and excitement well blended with likable characters. Each season the characters developed consistently and the Governor came on as a true sociopath...making him an ideal villan. Now with this new writer all we see are ridiculous character changes...Rick farming and this twisted deal with Carol, Daryl has lost his emotional charm, Michonne hasn't had any of her supreme bad-ass female warrior moments, Beth is someone all together different.....now the Govenor is getting soft?  HUH!!!!!! No consistency with the plot from show to show, it has become a mess. Why is 14 year old Carl shooting at walkers and working while all the Woodbury people,{ except Tyrese and Sasha,} sit around and do not contribute...all they have done all season 4 is let everybody else pull their weight around. Now their sneezing all over poor old Hershal. Really? I stay away from my grandma when I am sick out of respect for her well being. Very unlikable Woodbury people. Poor Glen. PLEASE bring the last writer back to clean up the horibble mess this season has become! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is so over-hyped it's beyond belief. I'm not saying this to provide a flippant and controversial reactionary counter view to the legions of die hard Walking Dead fans - most who I get the impression feel this show is completely devoid of fair criticism - it's just poor in my humble opinion. The reason why I feel largely underwhelmed throughout the whole time whilst watching this series, comes down to a variety of different aspects, including the mediocre cast (No coincidence AMC cut the budget massively when they realized they would have a mass audience for the show, funding or no...hmm)  who in my mind fail to offer a true depiction of the charismatic characters in the fantastic graphic-novel series by Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard.

It isn't all negatives though. There are certainly some shining lights in the series, such as Andrew Lincoln who portrays the lead 'Rick Grimes' in the show, who actually manages to do a decent job at playing a troubled family man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and Daryl the debutante in the TV series is also an interesting character. The rest of the cast however come across as empty-headed robots who seem incapable of doing anything by themselves without being given permission first. Occasionally one or two do pluck up the courage and kill the odd zombie or two but 99% of the time they end up dying in a humorously idiotic and preventable way as a result. This seems like folly on the writers behalf who will once in a while throw a spanner in the works and spoon feeding us this forced drama which almost never seems coherent staying in line with the overall narrative.

I could go on about how the The Guv'nor is about as scary as the Cookie Monster, how the writers of the show failed to accurately capture the drama of the group inside the prison (as it did in the comics) and how series 2 up until the last few episodes nothing of interest particularly happened. I've watched up to series 4 and it's failed to grip me once. Heed my advice and read the novels first or play the beautifully crafted Telltale game series which managed to offer a much more gripping and memorable story in a 5 hour interactive episodic game than this did in x10's that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first season was brilliant.
The second season was good.
The third season had its moments, although few and far between.
The fourth season is outright bad. If I remember correctly, the writing staff was pretty much replaced and to telling effect. The story arc is overblown and boring and just seems to ponder along. There isn't enough plot to fill up the 45 minute episodes. I'm just giving up on this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

My criticism of "The Knick" parallels that of WGN's new series "Manhattan". "The Knick" dates back to when you're great grandfather would've been running around the dirt streets of NYC and who wants to see that? There's nothing interesting in this backwards period of our history and, like "Manhattan", it's not at all colorful; in fact, they might as well filmed this in black-and-white because the muted grays and browns are just as bad. "The Knick" must've been pitched as "what if we mixed "House" with "Grey's Anatomy" and set it in medically ignorant 1900?" Unfortunately, the response was "yes, let's do this" instead of "get the hell out of my office and check yourself into rehab." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Worthless. I am very picky about the shows I watch, and after the first two I thought I'd continue watching this one. However, about the first 4 or 5 shows, I realized that they were dragging it out far too long. Every other scene seemed pointless and annoying. Close's character kept switching between evil and so stupidly quirky that you began to think she was schizophrenic. The "present-tense" drama that they kept teasing you with never got any clearer. It was a carrot on a stick that never got any closer, and in order to fill the empty space you got to see Danson's character standing next to his pool for the umpteenth time. Drivel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As Aeschylus would have said, "this blows." Bad writing, terrible casting, occasionally competent acting, really really really bad Southern accents. How this many good people can make something this bad is a mystery. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Most overrated show of the last year. Unrelatable characters and cookie cutter plots throw this in the gutter. Just because shes ugly doesnt make her realistic of relatable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not funny at all. more stupidly cute than anything. may have worked a little better in 1968. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Fortitude started out with great potential, after episode 6 it lost the plot and just ran out of ideas. I was so disappointed that I had to back track and see what did miss. They made  a mess out of a unique TV series and this was so disappointing It left me Flat. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am amazed that anyone could rate this series (apart from the marvellous scenery). Cast turned into 'zombies' because - wait for it - they were infected by killer wasps from a prehistoric mammoth. Wasps not only ate their insides and sometimes exploded out of every orifice,  but also caused said zombies to slash and  disembowel others.
Lost all credibility around episode 3. No amount of high quality casting could make up for derisory plot.
Come on... please!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I never liked Seth Rogen. I hate him even more, after watching Preach season finale and totally mess with the original comics. This show sucks. A lot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 3 has become a boring collection of episodes where not much changes from 1 to 13. It lacks both thrill and wit. The domestic policy arguments are boringly flat. Having left out any serious political enemies, there's just the primary debates. The international policy crisis is badly written and lacks realism. Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright act with aplomb, but achieve less and less for every episode. One thing stands out: Lars Mikkelsen's impersonation of a paranoid Russian president - excellent and chilling. It's worth watching series 3 only to see Danish Mikkelsen at his best. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is saddening to watch how season 3 of House of Cards has become a shoddy production that lacks both thrill and wit. Where Frank in the first two seasons was scheming and pursuing a real objective, his character has become a boring president with no ambition. He entirely lacks an agenda and pushes the same uninspiring America Works proposal for 12 full episodes, when the script writers could actually have made this an exciting partisan battle.

It's really a pity, the plot could e.g. build around a series of fierce attacks from the Republicans on his domestic policies (the Republicans are absent from season 3) and a more realistic international policy crisis. While Lars Mikkelsen's portrayal of a paranoid Russian president is excellent and entertaining, the whole storyline with a "peacekeeping mission in the Jordan Valley" is flat - there's simply no reason why Israel's east border would be threatened by anyone, an international force containing Russian soldiers (>sigh< it's too unlikely), a parachute jump by US soldiers into the encampment of the Russians (to do what, exactly?), then have the US soldiers flee when the first shot is fired - it is simply laughable. When the Russian president demands Claire's resignation as ambassador, Frank just bows to his demand and in the next episode there is not even an attempt at retaliation.

The attempt to deepen the female characters of the series is also a debacle. Both Claire and Jackie go to great lengths to satisfy the mens' desire to dominate and abuse their loyalty, then finally react halfheartedly but it adds nothing to the actual outcome of series 3.

The last chapter of season 3 epitomizes the script writers' inability to make the story move forward. Doug now seeks revenge on Rachel, which adds nothing and is only painful to watch (oh no, not another CSI where man murders woman). Why is this even in series 3? Doug is supposed to be dead, or else busy himself drafting strategies to help Frank defeat political enemies. I thought HoC was a different and intelligent TV series!

Where series 1 and 2 kept the suspense and the viewer only slowly realized what was going on, series 3 is unfortunately rather predictable. Obviously, the end of season 3 promises us that seasons 4 and 5 will mash the primary and the presidential campaign very, very slowly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

all the acting is great as usual but the story lines this time around were a complete bore. a big problem I had from early on was when Frank Underwood announced he was dismantling social security because Americans are entitled to nothing... sorry, that doesn't work for me since we are entitled to social security because it is our money the fed govt' has taken out of our pay every week. There is not a single person who would vote for underwood after he said and did that.  Unless you're one of the Koch brothers.
There were a couple decent episodes but it doesn't come close to the first two seasons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was the weakest season. The writing became less about political maneuvering and watching Frank Underwood's psychopathic genius and almost entirely about petty relationship issues between Frank and Claire.

Midway through the season Claire essentially leaves character and jumps the emotional shark. From that point on, the entire primary plot is overshadowed by petty emotional unrest.

For his part, Frank loses every political fight he enters and the viewer receives scant few moments of feel-good payoff.

This is a season without enjoyable victories or satisfying political payoffs and instead is emotionally draining the watch for the entirety. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It just seems to get worse with each season. The UK series wasn't perfect either, but it got it right with making the seasons 6 episodes each. Shorter, tighter. This always pads things out with useless relationship drama. I won't be back for the fourth season. I can already bet money that it will end with Frank being assassinated with Claire pulling the strings. Anti-hero cliche #5,041. No need to slog through another tedious season to get to that. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know. I wanted to like it but the cliché characters and their cliché dialogues are too much to try to ignore. You got the same characters from every film here. It's like ET meets some common thriller meets It Follows meets Goonies. I mean there is Chunk (the fat stressed out kid), token, the smart leader kid that is perfect and beyond his intelligence level, bullying at school, the sister that is involved with a jock trying to get some action, the drunk cop guy who lives alone because of some marriage break up ...... zzzzzzzzz so done. OH but an 80s score and theme makes it hipster so now its new and creative ? zzzzz Foff give me a break how much BS can one deal with seriously. I get it, if some Silver Lake/ Echo Park hipster saw this then, yes, I understand that it will be successful because hipsters never lived in the 80s so now they are obsessed and super cut they didnt llive in the best era, but for the rest of us who did live the 80s this show S U C K S... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow, this User Review section is full of SHILLS! Anyone gushing that this is great and rates it 9 or 10 is out and out lying. This is a boring, slow-paced Goonies / X-Files rip-off that features Winona Ryder having a nervous breakdown episode after episode. So it's an awful combination of boring and aggravating. It's 8-eps long, about 50 long drawn out minutes each, and was clearly designed to watch as a VERY long movie rather than as a satisfying episode-by-episode serial. But seriously, you can feel yourself age due to the oh so slow pacing. Don't believe the shills and don't waste your time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I recorded this show 3 times and tried really hard to like it, but I don't. It's choppy and seems to go no where. Grace tries so very very very hard to be a bad a$$, who puts up emotional walls, that it's a turnoff. And what is with her and her cousin? They laugh so much about "nothing" that it just seems weird, for a while I thought they were lovers. Except for Lorraine Toussaint, and a few other good actors, this show can be cancelled. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've now watched 5 episodes of 'Nurse Jackie' and my review is as follows. This is an idea put into place without a plan. With an average of 2 laugh's per episode, it is not a comedy. With no compelling medical cases, it's not a drama. It goes without saying it was never meant to be an action thriller. Which leaves us with what lies on the surface. A show of despair with no characters we can relate to, no character we would choose to spend time with, and certainly no character we ever hope to see as care givers. I see no value to this show, entertainment or otherwise. I'm done with it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I find this show to be painful to watch. There are no redeeming characters or people to root for or care about, and Edie Falco - who is a terrific actress - is completely unlikeable. Let's run down the roster of characters. Falco is an adulterous absentee mother who is poorly behaved at work, leads an (impossible to pull off) double life, and abuses drugs. The lead female doctor is cold and self-centered, and the Cooper guy is goofy with a 'tick' that doesn't exist. The nurse administrator is a laughably mean bureaucrat, but you can't root for her when her opponents are an unlikeable motley crew of misfits. The nursing student is annoying. The pharmacist has been providing drugs to the staff for years and has sex in the middle of the day in an ER with this Jackie loser. Jackie's husband is a bore, but she "loves" both. . . though there's no character development. All of that is enough, but then we have a horrifically unrealistic set of medical situations. Sanctioned euthanasia. Nurses gone awry and making medical decisions without doctors. Unprofessional behavior in front of the patients. I worked as a doctor for ten years and don't do it any more and don't take any pride in being a defender of the profession - but this is just so horribly done. The only redeeming quality is that it makes me so mad and the characters are so easy to hate that you can turn it on when you need to blow off some steam. Dumb, dumb, dumb. I've been watching Mad Men to get ready for that season and they're not even in the same stratosphere writing and quality wise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Too many sketch group members, and none of them memorable besides the wide-headed chin guy.  Slooooooooooow and too derivative.  A Python rip-off, minus the wit. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, I get that the dim lighting on all the gangster scenes is to convey the dark, early 20's furtive environment of Prohibition, but for the sake of viewers --- could the producers PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE film with enough lighting so we can see WHO is talking, their FACIAL EXPRESSIONS (which matter greatly on film), and a sense of WHAT IS HAPPENING on the scene.  Half the time, I'm only able to tell who is in the scene by recognizing their voices and left pondering what is happening as the lighting is too dim to make out the setting.  Many of the gangster actors are so shrouded in darkness that it's very hard to know who they are or how they fit into the plot. So why does HBO waste money filming scenes when they expect viewers  to only rely on voice recognition, background noise, to figure out what is happening?  If HBO's lighting budget is that limited, why don't they  just make an audiotape of the series? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Does the music and look of a show and its first season or so story and characters make up for a really weak, lazily written third season?  I say no. I know Neil Cross is busy but this is lazy writing. When in doubt, kill someone. Make everything about Luther (a vigilante decides he's a serial killer who is really killing everyone Luther loves, that's the ticket) then, how farfetched can it get, have Luther arrested for having arranged for people to be in a position to be killed by someone he is chasing. Bizarre. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What on earth has happened to doctor who? I remember the first of the new series being great, with Christopher Eccleston's darker more interesting doctor who, much more thought out plots that you could actually follow with decent special effects that looked believable and wasn't made only for kids. Lately however it seems to have turned into a CBBC show with rediculous plot lines that sound almost as if they where thought up by a child. The special effects make me wonder what has happened to the BBC spcial effects budget in the last year, since this seasons have been absolutely dreadful. Notthe doctor who I remember at all. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An incredibly overwrought, poorly written, poorly acted slog. I feel bad for all high schoolers if this is how bleak your everyday life is. Mine, as long ago as it was, was obviously all sunshine and rainbows. There are many YA books that deserve adaptation... the Asher book did not deserve THIS adaptation. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was quite disappointed in the season opening. Loved the opening and then it was downhill. Having House transition from an addicted, bitter depressive into discovering intimacy and how to trust and seek help in the space of two hours -- oops, a few weeks -- was so facile, it made it for difficult watching. And by trying to treat the subject of addiction seriously, it failed miserably in its over-simplification. The writing was terribly predictable and hit all the cliches of mental hospital dramatizations that have come before. It felt at times like it was a direct steal from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest -- but if you compare spending these 2 hours with the 2 hours of that film, it's like comparing spending 2 hours reading People Magazine to The Economist. I've been a regular admirer of House for its intelligence, wit and sparring between characters all in the setting of the medical diagnostic. This sunk to melodrama (the relationship with the German woman) and neat, simplistic answers to addiction. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

"This is Us" should be called "What group do we have left to shamelessly pander to?" Critics are such lame ass, group thinking, mindless, NPR listening losers. Its funny because they call themselves 'critc'' but critical thinking is usually the last thing on their agenda. This show is hardcore, offensively hackneyed poop. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a Homeland fan it kills me to say this season so far is horrible. Who wrote season 5? Were the original writers kidnapped and being held in a Pakistani black site.  I just don't understand what happened. As said before the story is weak, almost silly. Please pay the ransom and get the original writers back. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Every aspect of the show--from the music, to the soft, fuzzy look, to the slow dialog, to the pacing--seems calculated to put you to sleep.  I have to constantly remind myself that everything is NOT supposed to be a dream sequence, because that's the visual language they're using for every scene.  And this is coming from someone who loves other slow burn shows like Hannibal.  The acting is good, Rufus Sewell is great, but they somehow managed to transform this compelling concept, skilled actors, and great production value into an incredibly boring product. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

High production values.  Decent pilot and premise.  Terrible writing and acting.

The pilot episode is solid, and the production values are very high.  And although this might be enough to hook some people, the first three episodes are riddled with moments of terrible writing, acting or both, that grow more frequent along the way, culminating in episode 3's The Marshall character, which is laughably atrocious melodrama and seems to come from another show entirely.  It's as if a generation of superhero movies (good and bad) have primed the audience/filmmakers to a point where a show with this high of a budget would dare try a character this ridiculous, and in a show that wasn't supposed to be 'camp'.

The occasional bad shot or edit is also present in each episode, as when Julianna throws the man off of the bridge, with terrible, unbelievable action and shots; or a few edits that jump or don't match, for no particular reason.

Altogether, this show is in a dangerous area where it starts well enough to hook you (especially if you like the alternative history/sci fi premise) but falls apart very quickly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not everything in that show is bad. The casting is ok and actors visibly try their best. Pretty much everything else is a disaster, the writing is specially poor, with bad dialogues, poor character development and plots that make no sense.Bad also the very weird editing and the musical theme.I very much understand the decision of the network not to broadcast this second season and to drop the show altogether, because under this current form Southland was unsalvageable. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

absolutely adored  the first 3 /4's of  series one , then it slowly went downhill. The second series is just ridiculous. ranging from ridiculous scenes to poor acting. needless to say i wont be watching it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bring back brody already, I'm sick of seeing Carrie and Dana over and over again. The best part of the series was Brody; Dana is by far the most uninteresting and now she is getting the most screen time which is just ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The much anticipated season 3 of Homeland opens with a disappointment. The beginning two episodes lack the thrill, nail biting mystery and edge of the seats moments that made it popular at the first place.

The characters too add to the audience misery with Carrie's unbearable acts, which have become too monotonous with no dimensions to her. The supposed to be unpredictable Carrie has ironically become the most predictable character in the show and sadly irritating too. Add Dana's soapy over the top drama and the show has made a seamless transformation from the mystery thriller to a soap in the background of terrorism & CIA. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched the season opener for Homeland last night.  If anything, it's gotten less engaging as time has gone on.  I dropped out of watching it last season because Carrie Mathison was a completely unsympathetic and unbelievable character to have that position in the CIA.  It hasn't gotten any better.  You know a show is bad when you root for the protagonist to get machine-gunned. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Every shot "prettier" than the last. How is one branded without the searing of flesh rendered without smoke? Terrible art direction and camera work. No evidence of living scriptwriter. Don't get me started on the lighting direction. A worthy story reduced to a child's fairy tale level of production values. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All the subtlety of a campaign commercial: there's nothing but preaching to the converted here. If you don't believe that everything good and holy in this world was invented sometime in -- and by -- the Kennedy administration, you won't believe this show. I found it particularly disappointing since the advertising leading into the premiere led me to expect a naughty (but fun) show about naughty people doing naughty things with alcohol, cigarettes and sex at work before we decided (correctly) that these were all very bad. But still fun. Except no one on this show is having any fun at all. And neither will you (unless you require endless validation on how much better you are than your parents -- or their parents). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mad Men is a severely overrated drama containing hardly any drama, which is sort of critical to a drama. And with all of the sex, deceit, lies, secrets, infidelity, and shady motives, the lack of drama and intrigue is no less than shocking.
The performances are monotonous with precisely two exceptions, the characters are monotonous with precisely two exceptions, the writing is monotonous providing only a superficial spectrum of the time period it's set in giving little to no historical insight, the long running story has almost no continuity as the actions and behaviors and the people these characters interact with hardly ever carry on or tie in later in the show, and there's never any kind of a perspective or a point given. Mad Men just kind of floats along with no objective, no motive, and no story, which is fine in some cases, like Pulp Fiction, but it at least Pulp Fiction is actually entertaining, and its characters have strong and likable personalities. Mad Men has no redemptive qualities other than its aesthetics. Yes, it looks and feels exactly like the 60s, but you can get about as much out of Mad Men as you can from google searching advertising campaigns from the 60s. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I know a lot of people love this show and I respect that, but I honestly find it very boring. The plot is uninteresting to me and there is almost no action. To me mad men just seems like a well-written soap opera. If you think cinematography and writing matter more than simple enjoyment, this is definitely worth watching for you. If you just want a good show that doesn't make you ask yourself ''when is this going to be over?'' and a show that's not so slow and more exciting, than I'd highly recommend you skip it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season1 was excellent ... but the writers of S7 are amateurs .. they have completely squandered the opportunity to create some very interesting reflections on humanity. What they give is is formulaic melodramatic crap 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Okay, I admit there are some funny dialogues at time but not nearly enough to justify watching these absolutely horrid characters interact with each other and then be subjected to the gratuitous sex scenes. Literally, those scenes are like 'hey look at us, Hulu we can show sex and cuss on camera...yeahhhh'. I watched 4 episodes and will never watch another. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The positive reviews for this show seem to stem from a generation of people eager to accept ANYTHING with black people involved.
The writing is completely lacking in originality and devoid of humor, it swings from one stereotypical "black joke" to the next, with no comedy driven by character interaction, so in it's own circle of hypocrisy the show itself is offensive and racist. The only positive thing to say about this show is that the cast are all entirely capable of believable performances.
Honestly I could only recommend this show to white hipsters who are filled with glee at the sight of any black actor or actress gracing their screen.
That's not to take away from the fact that Anthony Anderson is a very talented man with excellent comedic timing, and genuine acting ability. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Predictable and lacking originality, but most of all lacking humour. The pinpoint focus on race quickly becomes tiresome, especially when it is fired-up by obnoxious or ignorant white faces like Fresh Prince was doing 20+ years ago. The main character, despite obviously being successful in his chosen career, is suddenly hit with a racial identity crisis. Hey, rich people got problems too, right? The whole concept seems trite and condescending to the audience, and at least 10 years out of date. But worst of all the jokes are slow and and can be seen a mile off, with about 3 actual laughs per episode. Give it a miss. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've given this show three chances based on everyone's gleeful praise. It really isn't very good. Everyone is over-acting. It has the subtlety of a blow torch and the originality of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. The biggest problem is that it just isn't funny. The concept is about as forced of a situation as I can remember since the sit-com began. Drek. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This season has little story, little pacing plodding along that in often quite bizzare in an utterly boring story. Excluding episode 3 where the show actually took a break from this ridiculous story. The season has been utterly uneventful.. Last season built up towards a 5 minute ending, a gapping anti-climax that was over in most of those 5 minutes. This season builing 5 minutes towards the ending.. The rest of the time is about everything else that most do not care about at all, containing plotlines and characters that serve no functioning purpose.

12 century monks had clay tablets, not feces, engraving on metal could have translated better, stenciling.. The wonderbra hasn't been invented so quit using a bicycle pump for padding. Those catsuits are grim.. Who makes the dolls I mean where does she go shopping  for the moulds. The devil a puppetmaster  makes  **** So they get naked and make dolls. WTF 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First episode the weak as cats 'new evil witch look like vampire women' push the cart over, take down 2 horses, and are super fast, but are too weak to overcome hand to hand combat with miss Ives and Chandler. Terrible start, and it doesn't improve. As sporadic as season 1, but more boring: Containing more nonsensical social drama. It's hard to empathise with the pains of characters when the story seems ingenuine. The frankenstein backstory was more interesting to me than the main plot again, but once again didn't immalgamate well, and just feels like episodes are being made off the cuff. Eva Green and John Clares very short conversation was compelling, but every other dialogue just inconsistent, wierd and mostly boring.
I like that Billie Piper now has an English accent after rebirth. It was nice to see her naked on a few occasions as well. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Gander that it should be good, but damn it's not.  The book was great, the crew looks solid ... but it's hard to struggle through an episode without thinking "huh" and "wow, this is borderline horrible".  Reasons?  Ricky Whittle is horrific in this - his lines come of so scripted its simply vomitus.  He sounds like he is reading off cards and his mannerisms are terribly transparent.  The way his ex-wife walks to the car out of the Casino in Episode 4 is simply nauseating - fingers on a chalkboard.  Does nobody see this in post-production?  Good actors just are ... this Whittle dude is having his challenges.  If it weren't for McShane and his, what some would perceive as a glass eye ... totally rugged.  After I try and will myself through an episode (I went through 4), I must watch The Leftovers and Fargo just to get back to base 1 sanity and remind myself that there is still talent on TV.

Perplexed by the numbnutts higher ups that say 'Yeah guys, friggen' great job!' while giving each other high-5's ... not understanding who let this out of the cage - he or she should be fired.  If the crew would have come to me with Episode 1 and said 'Boss, what you think ... good to go?' ... I would have said "Drawing board now ... this dogs#it is f'in sub par."  But in a culture like America where sub-standard IS par-for-the-course and people take the I-don’t-want-to-think-but-just-zone-out stance, shows like this surpass in ratings truly lovely works of art like Tom Hardy's Taboo.

Simply rugged. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

About as entertaining as vomit. The upside of vomit is that after vomiting, you generally feel better; on that count, vomit has the advantage over this show. The two points I did give it were for its single redeeming moment: the punch in the face of the leprechaun. Horrific, masturbatory direction, no plot, grade-school dialogue, ridiculously overdone visuals all result in a steaming pile of hollywood restaurant food. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

American Gods fasci.ates with questionable means. The focus is pure violence against life itself, presented in strong visual image
Similar to Frank Miller's Sin City or 300.

Unlike 300 or Sin City, the viewer is unusually close to the protagonists. Since these are anything but sympathetic, this creates a disgust.

Problematic, because it is about gods and not everyone is this form of representation fallen. Since the questions of good & evil, believe and not believe or black & white should not be treated by a entertainment series, which puts their focus on pictures, it is the best not even to turn on. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

could this move any slower 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Louis CK. I love his stand-up, I love his FX show, I love his appearances on talk shows.

Horace & Pete is wildly disappointing. The cast is amazing, the acting is strong... but it just goes nowhere. It's shot like a 3 camera comedy with no audience and weird lighting. Nothing that happens in the show engages me. FAIL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Simply not funny. This show follows hackneyed stereotypes in search of laughs that fade within the first ten minutes. The funniest part about it is the comedicly bad acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another one bites the dust, great premise but lacks all heart. It went for an hour but I literally felt like I was watching it for days, so tedious and dragged out boring. The casting is horrible, Russell is completely miscast in the role and does not ever come across as being able to defend herself, let alone beat up someone bigger than her. Her acting is flat and lifeless. It's trying to ride the hype of the recent terrorist shows out at the moment and in this case no amount of Phil Collins music will help it succeed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

For God's sake QUIT YELLING AT ME!  I can't stand bad singing, I really can't stand bad fake singing.  I can't believe that I watched this show and that it gets the positive reviews, must be the lemming thing... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stereotypes are really offensive. Music is boring. What age group likes this stuff? 10 yr old American Idol wannabes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not funny, the humor is lame. And my biggest pet peeve: they keep ruining good songs like "Don't Stop Believing", "No Air", and "Gold Digger". For that this show gets a 2, I know a lot of people like their cover songs, but their cover songs are horrible. I don't hate music covers, some have been good for me, but those on this show are just weak. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I understand my friends love this so much. The show is superficial in its storyline. I like to see more of Will and Sue story because it's the only real story. Those teenage drama is so fake. This show is like every crappy teenage shows about unrealistic love and ridiculous **** fights, so the producers think that having cover songs will save it. Even cover songs didn't save it. The cover songs are so Auto-Tuned and bland without any emotion. It don't deserve any nominations. Overhyped show targeted for teens! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I barf all over the show that is Glee. It is a shame on the definition of the word. It used to be fantastic in its simplistic roots, however it is now becoming the tragedy of a Broadway over-production that all the naysayers warned us about. The realism that captured audiences in the beginning now flails in between full-fledged musical, and stereotypes to the extreme. If Lynch can't save it, no one can. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Then again, I didn't like the movie, either. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show would be great if they would leave all the SEX out of it. I know kids are having sex but it show like these that are promoting it. My son plays high school football and loves to watch this show but last nights episode went way too far with all the bedroom scenes. Teenagers do not need shows to promote sex they can figure it out on there own. I don't need my son thinking he needs to be like those football players having sex he has enough peer pressure as it is. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Varsity Blues, thats all it is 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was shocked! This show is all about Teen Sex, and it's a real shame. This could be a really good show if the producers would eliminate the senseless side plots of who's sleeping around with who. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Ted Danson and Kristen Bell are heavenly, but "The Good Place" is hellish and ill conceived. Poking fun of Christianity is a sure way to alienate and offend a large demographic. In addition, the Bible warns that God is not to be mocked:  Galatians 6:7 "Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." In an age of political correctness, it is wise to avoid intentionally pushing buttons that don't need to be pushed. Virtue and morality are qualities that should be esteemed not trivialized. Degrading humor requires little imagination. The writers behind "The Good Place" may be to blame for the show's imminent demise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

..

Great concept.
Awful show.

This had so much potential.
The first episode was really good.
But, don’t let that fool you. It goes nowhere, fast.
I stopped watching shortly after the fourth episode.

The main character is annoying. The actress playing her either can’t act (I’m not familiar with her other roles) or she has been seriously miscast / misdirected. She has this annoying energy, like she’s performing for children on a live-action morning show. I’m not sure if this is a misguided attempt to be cute or satirical, or something, but it just comes across as patronizing.

The concept – a sinner accidentally being sent to heaven – doesn’t suit the lowest-common-denominator television format. To pull it off, requires subtelty and attention to detail. Instead, it feels like the entire thing is phoned in. They have too much faith in the concept and it lacks the careful execution it requires.

The characters are so one-dimensional, I ended up hating all of them less than halfway through the first season. By the fifth episode, the show was already boring me.

The same thing keeps happening, over and over.

Eleanor (the protagonist) naively misinterprets minor good deeds for major spiritual revelations. Chidi (her reluctant ethical mentor) continues to react in exactly the same way. He is, seemingly, as shocked by her lack of moral fiber no matter how many times he encounters the same situation. In true cardboard cut-out fashion, he behaves as if he’s never met her before (and the audience has never met him). Chidi reacts to her misdeeds like a child stepping out into the world for the first time. He reacts as if he grew up in heaven (as opposed to Earth).

Tahani is awful. But (again) it’s not the character perse. The actress playing her either can’t act competently or (like Eleanor) she’s been severely miscast / misdirected. Her performance is about as subtle and nuanced as the guy inside the H.R. Pufnstuf costume. The only reason she annoys me less than Eleanor is: we don’t see that much of her. Otherwise, she is the worst character on the show.

Jianyu was great when he was a Buddhist monk. The idea behind his character is wonderful. A typically immoral self-involved moron is accidentally sent to heaven, in place of a spiritualist who has taken a vow of silence. There is a lot to work with there. But, the execution fails miserably. In the end, once the real Jianyu has been revealed, all we get is stereotyping and typical moronic sit-com dialogue.

The only characters I like are: the town’s architect, Michael (because Ted Danson is always pretty good, regardless of the material); and Janet, who serves as everybody’s all-knowing personal assistant. But, unfortnuately, they’re not compelling enough to carry an entire show.

Finally, there’s the art direction. Heaven looks like a small town in a modern adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, for some reason. Combined with the over-the-top acting, it makes the whole show feel even more patronizing. Like, the showrunner thinks their audience has the sophistication of toddlers. Either that or the majority of the crew (set-designers, costume-designers, directors and casting directors) are all taking way too many psychedelic drugs.

I’d like to like this show. It is one of the freshest, most original, concepts I’ve seen on television in a long time. But, I can’t bear to watch another second of it. I'd rather not watch television, at all. I’d, honestly, rather watch nothing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the most boring TV shows I've seen. Besides the female urologist, the other surgeons are arrogant and self-indulgent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As an avid reader of all the books the casting is awful and the story isn't even close.  I had such hopes for the show and it certainly isn't delivering. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Wow. So far (Episode 1) this adaptation is really bad. As an avid reader of all the novels I can say that there are already so many small things wrong with the first episode that apart from the names of the characters I fear this tv-show will have nothing in common with the source material first up and most glaringly:
- Uthred is described as being light blonde -> his TV character has raven black hair

- Ragnar is described as being light blonde hence why people always assume that he is Uthred's father

- in the books Ragnar takes a liking to Uthred straight away and is described as a jovial man and lover of people --> in the TV show his counter part is so far rather sour and treats Uthred like a slave.

- Ubba is described in the books as having a chest like a barrel, a big belly and raven black hair and being fiercely bearded --> the TV show has some tall lanky guy with light blonde hair and a red beard.

- Ubba has a brother named Ivar who invades the British Isles with him and Ragnar. This person does not exist in the TV show yet.

- Pater Beocca is described as being young, red haired and crippled -> his TV character is a man easily in his 50's (which at the time of the novels was considered ancient) and apart from that a normal looking priest

- Ragnars younger son is said to be in Ireland when in the TV show he is apparently hanging around his fathers homestead

- Ragnar has a son close to Uthred's age in the book called Rorik who is his main companion throughout the whole first book during his childhood

- Uthred's father takes Uthred with him for the battle in Eoferwick --> in the TV show Uthred somehow escaped on his own, magically finds armor that fits and runs after his father on horseback

- the main battle is described as taking place close to Eoferwick's city walls which the Danes have apparently lazily repaired, the Saxons take this as a sign of weakness and attack that section of the city in which they are then trapped because behind the bad walls the Danes had places fresh ones. --> in the TV show the battle happens in some kind of field which is completely flat (as Uthred's father points out) yet the Danes are somehow able to disguise half their army and attack the Saxons from the rear.

- now at this point it is important to note that Bernard Cornwells is famous for the meticulous detail he uses when describing battle scenes and tries to get them as accurately as possible. Usually his research in this area is absolutely on par with a professional historian --> in the TV show the shield wall of the Danes is absolutely wrong, instead of forming a swine head to break the shield wall the Saxons simply storm onto it and bash on it with their swords flailing. These are all details that Cornwell describes very differently in his books because in real life that kind of behaviour would have gotten you killed. Furthermore the Saxons abandon high ground which again, in Cornwells books, would never happen. The Saxons also only need 2 minutes to decide what to do. In the book the process of going about it because there is no true king but 3 equal generals is described at length and in great details. Also in nearly every novel Cornwell takes great pains to explain to have Uthred explain to the reader that breaking a shieldwall and fighting in one is nasty business and requires a lot of mental toughness and takes time to get into Blood Rage. Yet in the TV show the Saxons simply storm onto a ready made shield wall (certain death) within 30 seconds or so.

- Uthred's youth is spend invading the British Isles with the Danes yet after a cut Uthred is now apparently in his late 20's and still with the Danes althought in the books by then Ragnar has long been dead, Uthred has met Alfred, Brida, escaped the North and joined Alfred's fleet as it's commander and has had several assassination attempts behind him.

- Uthread has a shaven chest... seriously... the guy who plays Uthred a guy living in 865 A.D. has a shaved chest and a finely cut and shaved goatee even though there were no razors per se about and no mirrors either.

All in all this first episode has been so disappointing that I doubt I will continue watching it. The novels are so amazing and so great and I was so looking forward to a TV make but I should have expected it after what they did to the Sharpe novels. Why the hell can't they just simply take a well written and beloved novel as it is and don't tinker around and cast someone who actually looks the part? What the hell is so hard about not trying to make something better?

It's a damn shame... this could have really been a realistic Game of Thrones but it looks like it's going to be the Tudors in 9th Century England.

Oh btw. everyone talks about England in the tv show even though there was no England at the time and won't be for another 80 years. Furthermore why do all the Danes speak English? That's just weird. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It took a lot of persuading for Cornwall to allow another series be adapted from one of his books after ITV took on SHARPE. He believes they never do them justice. After watching the first five episodes I can't help but feel he has once again been let down but this time by the BBC. He had probably hoped that they might hire a show runner like Michael Hirst - but they didn't. It's not even close to "VIKINGS" but to be honest Vikings is slowly crumbling.

Although Cornwalls' books aren't necessarily subtle or complex, they are a rollercoaster. They're fun. This isn't, mainly because it lacks the wit, and the empathy or antagonism he Creates for his colourful characters . The script is poor to say the least, there is a vast amount of exposition and constant interjections of "old language" which just sits so badly.

Props, costume and cinematography are as unsubtle and unrealistic as the dialogue - Although it has moments of beauty they are far and few between only serving to highlight how simple and unthought out the rest of it has been shot.

I'll forgive the fact that in the ten years that uhtred grows into a man, the Vikings have built a mud hut for a farm and haven't been attacked once by their enemies, what I won't forgive is the fact that I simply don't care for any character, mainly because I have no idea what anyone wants, nor have I gotten to know their flaws. This lack of empathy has simply resulted in a lack of interest in a cast of cardboard cut outs.

I gave this two stars, one for the attention paid to the shield wall formation and execution of the battle and the other for the kid who acts as young uhtred.

With the exception of PEAKY BLINDERS, Why can't British TV get their epic shows right. Even for a viking period drama it still ends up looking and feeling like DOWNTON bloody ABBEY! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This boring show is made unwatchable by its awful cinematography. For some reason, the director thought it would be artistic to tilt the camera, do a lot of hand held camera work, and show lousy composition. The sound mix is terrible, and there are many passages of dialog that are completely unintelligible. I never knew American History could be so off putting! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Horribly cast, this is a mockery of history. Important points are glazed over or omitted entirely. Did the producers actually read David McCullough's biography?? Paul Giamatti is abominable as John Adams, a sloppy schlumpy mess. An Italian-American guy plays an English-American. Giamatti looks nothing like Adams' portraits. David Morse is also horribly mis-cast. Just all around garbage, except for the sets. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

John Goodman brilliantly played a believable religious and patriotic fanatic.  Also, Glenn Close' callous and cunning performance was equally perfectly executed.  However, I found Rose Byrne difficult to watch.  Her pouty face hidden by her hair, her bedroom voice, and her weak script made her scenes slow moving, not credible, and annoying.  I was hoping for a much more assertive and commanding presence from her. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I enjoyed the first 3 seasons immensley. Unfortunately, Season 4 is a shocker. It is obviously produced by the B-team this time, and it was a con-job of the network to initially lead me to believe this would be another great season. If you have never watched Damages and were turned off with this season ... all I can say is you are right ... but Seasons 1,2, and 3 will not disappoint you. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The new season of damages is showing symptoms of having been taken over by a content provider who has never done content production before.  Season four is marked by a lack of "edginess", less complexity in character development, and a recycling of certain storytelling mechanisms used in prior seasons : evil corporate executive is the target of Ellen's next big case, complete with out of control lackey who takes matters into his own hands and delights in bossing around the boss.  Sound familiar?  It should - we saw this before when it was called season 1.  The editing is even bad - certain shots are clumsily pasted together and clearly show the actors were not engaged in a live exchange during filming (wasn't he mid-laugh and wearing glasses a split second ago??). Not to mention dragging out has-beens like Goodman, who hasn't worked since being the dad on Roseanne.  Among other things, this series is quickly becoming the place where washed up actors go to die.  The series really has lost something this season.  I had to stop watching during the second episode, it was so ill-conceived and poorly stitched together.  I highly suggest these actors, a few of them talented, immediately seek work elsewhere and jump from this quickly sinking ship. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its Not Funny....
So I recently watched the episode were she investigates a stolen painting of a thumb and it presented so many clever "I see what you did there" type of jokes, but they just weren't funny enough, I just wanted to like this show, but I couldn't finish the episode. The characters mainly set up pretty silly 3 stooges style personalities that don't work at all and they drag on a lot were you just want to scream OK I GET IT. I watched the recent kidnap episode and just could not enjoy it. I must admit the show has well written plots, that all I can say positively about it. The jokes are meh, the cast is ok, and the overall show is a major pass, you will get a chuckle probably every 3 episodes or not? I don't know the show just doesn't work guys. I wanted to like the show but it was just too hard. I think they bumped American Dad! back on Mondays for re-runs of this show at 9PM, woah, wow....oh ok 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am simply stunned something this bad was aired at all, let alone as a marathon. It was embarrassingly unfunny, unimaginative, predictable and charmless. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this season was awful: a stupid plot, bad characters, anything transcendental. Dexter appears to be retarded in this season. The worst season of dexter for sure. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A seemingly omnipotent villain, a smouldering idiot of a hero, cardboard cutout superiors, and pedestrian production doom this sad attempt at Angry-Loner-Cop-Show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Luther went downhill so fast it made my head spin!  Season I, Zoe is dead.  Season 2, who is Zoe and who cares?   Nooooooo.   And I want more ALICE.  Oh well, what I get is idiocy.  With Luther putting a band-aid on a nail hole in his hand!  All the way through?  Oh yeah, he's not Luther, he's SHAFT.   Well, I'm shafting Luther right now.  Ciao silly show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Quite possibly the most disappointing (new) television series I've watched in the last 10 years.
The show revolves around the 'lives' of a group of scientists (plus their wives/girlfriends) in what is a completely fictional narrative, using the backdrop of Los Alamos and the drive of each 'group' to exist in a world hidden from the rest of the country.
There are some good points, the acting is top drawer, as is the score and photography... But the producers have fallen into the 'modern' trap of trying to offer up 21st Century values on a show set in 1943. I understand that rampant sexism, constant smoking, blatant racist slurs, and the fact that most people at Los Alamos seemed to spend pretty much all their off time having sex... Don't make for what is, ostensibly, a TV show which follows modern guidelines on acceptability.
No one swears, there's not a 'lived in' sense to any of it...
But, it's also incredibly dull.
The Manhattan Project was one of America's greatest achievements of the Twentieth Century, having that as the driving foreground to a weekly television show would have been fantastic.
But... As the series progresses, the narrative switches from the scientific/moralistic dilemmas of the 'men', to the banal, incessant sniping of the 'women'. OK, the last episode of the first series does (because it has to) switch back to the more 'important' plot elements of the creation of the atom bomb...
Yet, I suspect I won't be looking to tune into the second series, which is currently airing as I write this review.
Definitely a show to avoid! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This series uses a historical event to portray a contrived soap opera of psychologically scared and emotionally weak individuals to give the impression of what life was like there. It has little bearing on the reality/ history of that industry nor of the people involved. The real problem is that todays generation will believe that's what actually happened or how people behaved. It is utterly contrived. As others have said I would never recommend this show to anybody because it has no basis in reality. The CHARACTERS in this program are paper thin and only a tool for the writers to tag an implausible plot line to. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So far this show is crap...a complete rip off of their earlier work of frisky Dingo but with less imagination, and unlike sealab I dont think this will grow on you. The only rememberable thing from the first two episodes is the YUP from Lana, other than that I say late to the show. You might think this is funny if you have never watched adult swim 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is now that funny, a bit slow, and the stories are very very dry. I really do not see what people see in it. The main character I would describe as, annoying, and just makes me want to hate the show because it is about him. The lack of a strong story also makes be able to turn off the show any time. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Rachel Bloom is very talented and I usually like quirky, but celebrating shallow self-absorption is just not to my taste.  Perhaps it will get better (I only watched the pilot), but I don't have the stomach to try another episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

A plot that echos the unrealistic fantasies found in Fifty Shades of Grey, except this time focusing on the call girl profession. The main character is constantly pandered to by wealthy businessmen clients despite her plain looks, emotionless expressions, and dull personality.

The dialog feels stilted and the characters feel more like caricatures than real people. The plot twists feel staged as if only to create some sense of drama, rather than occurring organically.
And for those intrigued by the sex appeal of the show.. even those scenes are dull and passionless.

Post production is done well though, and it's a nice looking show, albeit a bit on the dark side (everything seems to be muted shades of grey).

All in all a very disappointing show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Pilot was awesome, downhill ever since. Most of the show has nothing to do with hacking.  This show has a basic plot that easily could have been a two part series, the writers are filling the show with useless garbage. Be realistic it  was signed for a second year after the pilot was shown, now its a dud. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

First show great. Second show really good third show very good. Fourth show good. Fifth show bad. Sixth show really bad. See where this is going? Nowhere fast. The drug addled main character is so weird looking it's the typical stereotype of genius nerd. Just no plot 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its just a boring version of Fight Club. Fight Club worked because they didnt try to pan the main character off as some sort of genius. Rather, the guys in Fight Club were just ordinary average folks who didnt have much skills but were genuinely frustrated with the world. It worked. This does not and the reason is it takes itself too seriously and anyone with above average IQ and about 25 years of wisdom will tell you the premise of the protagonist is actually false not because the world isnt corrupt, but because his solution is 100% worthless and wouldnt make a lick of difference. This is why the show needed some humor and to tone down the "genius" hacker angle and just make everyone average Joe. But it tries really hard with kiddie tech speak about rootkits and traffic routing as if these arent considered and monitored closely by a million security monkeys across the globe right now... humor would have helped lighten a otherwise eye rolling plot.

The actors are also very one dimensional overall though it could just be the bland script. Hollywood, yet again, assumes very smart folks are actually damaged and borderline retarded addicts which is opposite of how the are in reality which, again, brings about many eye rolls when they do something off the top stupid like get addicted to drugs, or murder for money etc etc. That is not how genius level folks work nor do they think that way regardless of how damaged they were as children. Only average IQ (and below) folks act that way.

Anyway, I could barely finish season 1 and I will not be watching season 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I keep asking myself while watching this,  what are the characters trying to achieve? The show drags on and on, every descent plot has been used up in this. You can skip through half an episode and miss very little to anything. No intelligent dialogue, useless and new characters showing up left and right to be killed off. I understand this is a fictional zombie movie, but why haven't the hordes of zombies died out by now? Where is the food they get, (certainly there can't be that many living humans for all of them to feed off) where does the energy come from that allows them to walk miles on end day and night? Why aren't the zombies eating each other? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Now that the season has come to a close, I can say with confidence that Season 6 has been by far-and-away the worst season of the show ever. The reasons for that are fairly simple, and mostly relate to the deteriorating quality of the writing. Some of my main complaints for those who care to read:

1.) A lack of new ideas and plotlines. The show has now rehashed the plotline of finding and losing a safezone too many times for its own good. The CDC, Herschel's farm, the Prison, Woodbury, Terminus, and now Alexandria...it's time to try something else.

2.) A reliance on cheap jump-scare style tropes to create tension. How many times in this show have we seen some survivor ambushed by a slow-moving, noisy and clumsy walker out of nowhere? This is at least three years into the zombie apocalypse...people should not be surprised by "lone-wolf" walkers anymore. And yet just in the finale, stone-cold Carol Pelletier is almost bitten by a walker that manages to sneak up on her.

3.) Characterization can change on a whim depending on the demands of the plot. The writing for this show, this season especially, has felt forced and far from organic. Characters make foolish and uncharacteristic decisions because the plot demands them to be in a certain place at a certain time in order for a certain pre-ordained event to take place. I'll give you an example. The final three episodes of this season were atrocious because you had quite literally the most hardened survivors all make stupid and out-of-character decisions in order to place themselves in a position of extreme vulnerability for the finale. Carol leaving a safe haven because she "can't kill for them," leaving a note which of course led people to chase after her, and then killing four Saviors immediately after her departure. Also, see Daryl and his banzai attack after Dwight, promptly followed by Glenn, Michonne, and Rosita. These decisions make no sense in any context, let alone the one they're in, and it's all done to make them prisoners of the Saviors in the finale.

4.) And the most egregious of complaints I have. The show feels like it's being written at this point with more interest by the producers in garnering shocking moments for the audience than in telling a cohesive, interesting story. There are three glaring examples of this throughout the season. The first one was the Glenn fake-out, a subplot so outlandish and manipulative that it's gotten its own nickname: the 'Glenncident.' The entire fiasco contributed absolutely nothing to Glenn's character or the story being told this season. In fact, the first episode back from the mid-season break, we see Glenn charge into a horde of walkers with no way out, only to be saved by Daryl-ex-machine. He learned nothing!

The second example is at the very end of the penultimate episode of the season, when Dwight surprises Daryl for what seems like the fifth time and shoots him in the back. Cut to credits. Is Daryl dead? Would they really do that at the end of an episode? No, of course they wouldn't. The next time we see Daryl, he is bloodied but not injured to any discernible degree. His being shot contributed nothing to the character or the story, it was just meant to shock us and lead to fan speculation.

And finally, we come to the finale. An overlong, commercialized mess that ends in what might be the most unfulfilling season finale in TV history. Meeting Negan was cool for sure, but it was only half of what the show had been telegraphing for the entire back side of the season. Withholding the identity of Negan's victim again (sound like a broken record here, I know) has no bearing on the story. It is a move simply meant to leave viewers hanging to ensure they come back for next season. I seriously hope it backfires, because you can't tease a major series-changing event for 7 episodes and then fail to deliver on that. Fail isn't even the right word, because the event was there, it was just gutted of all meaning by leaving the viewer guessing.

A truly astounding "artistic" choice that only reinforces what many viewers are seeing more plainly than ever. The story and the characters don't matter anymore. All that matters is that the audience has their requisite OMG moments every season. I for one am checking out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm so glad this is the final series of this show. This is the biggest load of drivel to ever hit HBO. I sat through the first and second season of the show with a partner and could not stand it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I loved Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but this show just did not work for me.  There wasn't enough focus on Luke Cage himself.  All the sideplots and other characters were really boring, and the acting was pretty terrible.  I ended up skipping through most of the last episodes to fast forward Luke's plot line.  I hope they just reintegrate him back into the Marvel Universe as I don't think it works as a standalone show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are we watching the same show? The acting is cringe worthy. The hero is hard to relate to (with so much his past being mysterious). I do not understand his interactions with the villains. Everyone else he beats to an inch of their lives, but the most dangerous bad guy he "warns" a thousand times? It makes no sense. This honor in the ghetto makes no sense! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Started off fairly well, bu with virtually no back story to explain the strength and "bulletproofness" the title character is blessed/cursed with. By episode 9 it had become absolutely mired in a mishmash of terrible scripts, directionless directing and plot lines that had no idea where they were going.

The constant flashback/forward/back again is never the best way to provide back story, and it's used far too much here. Sack the director, you'll have a better show would be my cure for most of what's wrong with Luke Cage.

As a spin off from Jessica Jones it's inferior to JJ in most every single way - and isn't likely to do much for the career of the main participant, Mike Colter. Whose gangster character in that lawyer show that went on forever - that was better written in every way.

But this very average made-for-TV thing is - actually way below average for Marvel productions. Even the poor serving they produced for Daredevil was better than this half-baked offering. The drafting-in of Rosario Dawson to play the Claire nurse character from Daredevil - plot aspects based on crackpot coincidence never serve to satisfy any but the least discerning of viewers.

Teens and fanboys will no doubt be outraged at this critical review; but then if they like to read reviews they like, they should stick to reading reviews of quality shows. And this isn't a good quality show by any means.

By episode 10 it's showing all the battle-weariness of some moribund junk that's having every last piece of appeal wrung out of it before the plug gets pulled. It's getting to be packed full of scenes that contribute NOTHING to the story line, they're only there to serve as padding since the main plot is so desperately thin. The last two or three viewed seemed to me to have all the quality of writing to be expected if produced over coffee ten minutes before screening - and scribbled on the back of a cigarette packet.

And when the plug is pulled on this one, well - only the most avid of fans could work up a temerature about it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Los primeros episodios son entretenidos.... después se torna una serie predecible, repetitiva y aburrida.
No tiene nada que ver con fanatismos sobre Marvel o DC como leí en otros reviews, ni siquiera leo comics,  y hasta que no vi en la presentacion que decia Marvel, ni sabia que la serie estaba basada en comic. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched season 1 and part of season 2, and decided that there was no reason to go on anymore. George turned into a jerk (cheating on Nina, for instance), and even before then he was annoying. The writing has been lauded as being "sharp," but I was mostly bored. The vampires lacked menace, and the main vampire baddie of the first season (Eric) looked more like Santa Claus than a bad guy. Vampires are supposed to be tall and thin and beautiful, people. I realized that less happens in a 60-minute episode than in a US-length 40-minute one, or even in a 20-minute Disney Channel show. I liked Annie for the most part, and Mitchell was alright in the first season, but the only characters who ever triggered any sort of emotional reaction were the two guest ghosts. I found the characters to be undeveloped and rather flat. The show also lacked a sense of depth and darkness. Heck, even Twilight had more darkness than Being Human! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was hoping my first review here would be a more positive one. Unfortunately its not going to be. The plot is going downhill since the pilot. I see no future for this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If this show is supposed to be competition, I doubt Glee has anything to worry about..  Glee has had more misses than hits lately, and my wife and I were hoping that Smash would be a good alternative.  The characters were annoying, the story contrived and the numbers mediocre.  Good thing this show really fictitious.  It would never make it out of workshop.  Probably won't make it past this season if the Nielsen's are any indication.  Last many of their viewers, we quit watching halfway through it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

why aren't we talking about how THE WIRE is the best show ever made, and not wasting our time on this? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Stopped watching. Some of the most melodramatic, hammy acting this side of Day-Time Drama. Can't take the Curtis freak-out, the Bauer family reveal, the silly grotesque characatures that are the antagonists. We all need to say "enough" and send this show packing.. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I find 24 unwatchable because it is just too divorced from reality to engage my emotions or intellect. Out of all the absurdities that make up this story, I think the most unbelievable is that two guys would be feuding over Clhoe!! Yes, The Wire is the best show ever. Ever. God, how I would love to see Omar go after Jack!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestly, 24 is a great show! Always was, always will be. It does however end with Season 4. The only interesting characters die in an absolutely pathetic manner, other characters die because they're just morons surrounded by more morons and the plot -- it stops being a political thriller and becomes a very poor imitation of StarWars. I own seasons 1 to 4 on DVD, watched season 5 and after seeing season 6 decided that I'm more interested in Telletubbys than season 7. I don 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Implausible, to the point of being ridiculous. We treat it as a comedy and cut it to shreds laughing all the way. Alas it has grown too tiresome to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really enjoyed True Blood Seasons One and Two. I began watching Season 3 with excitement but was quickly disappointed with the direction of things. Seems great emphasis is being placed on homosexual activity. Even amongst those characters that have had traditional heterosexual roles in earlier seasons. If HBO expects to keep their viewers they better stop the homo crap!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Scrubs is a mildly humorous comedy/drama television series. However, I didn't like the show because the characters were unlikeable, the humor was mostly offensive and its climaxes were boring and predictable. The only reason I made it all the way to the sixth season was because of the Janitor. He was everything a character in comedy series should be. He's the only reason I rate this show a two. Sadly, there was too much main cast and too little Janitor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hated it! I think we will get tired of the LA mentality pretty quick. But I do like Sean and Christian as actors...Way too many commercials !!!!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Was not impressed. As a long time viewer, I think the producers have made a fatal mistake in moving their show to LA. Missed seeing the usual characters in their comfortable settings. I give it a year. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I found this to be a Take It Or Leave It kind of show........somewhat interesting, but easy to walk away from and not really miss at all.  I DID watch the first season, but was not compelled to watch the second.  Kind of boring overall. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why is this show so popular? Everyone in this awful series is a bloody moron and the "urethra revelation" episode proves it. I hope no one is rating this show because of the **** and **** sex, don't get me wrong, I love both of those things as much as the next person but damn people... Even porn has a better story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although this show is relatively entertaining, with the exception of the segments pertaining to her life outside of prison, the show lacks any hint of authenticity. All of these women have been convicted of crimes that warrant prison time and yet they are all portrayed as having a heart of gold. Anyone that has seen lockup would know that even in a women's jail life is much more intense than what has been portrayed in this program. Totally not buying Laura Prepon as any form of heroin dealer (she would be dead in seconds flat) because heroin is a much more serious game than just selling weed. I also find it incredibly hard to believe that a person would even be indicted let alone sentenced for a ten year old crime based on nothing more than the testimony of a criminal trying to get their sentence reduced. All that being said I think the show is still relatively entertaining which came as a complete surprise considering its from the same creator of that awful excuse for a television program they call Weeds, what a pile of crap that is. They could also do without that annoying Regina Spektor noise. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought I was going to see the B side of a Hollywood actress but it developed into the story of the struggle of a mother and her three problematic girls. Only for mothers with problematic girls. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What a dismal show.

The coming attractions of the past month had set the bar pretty low, yet the pilot episode didn't even clear the lowered bar.

If you're having a really good day, and want to quell the happiness, this looks like the show to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Not liking this season much. Sad, b/c I wanted to. The new Dr is boring and I don't care much what happens to him. The new Tardis interior seems like compensation to try and interest us, knowing that the plot and actors will not. Kind of...hmmm... I guess the word is shallow. The Tennant and Smith seasons seemed to be about complicated men who acted shallow and playful, occasionally showing their (often tragic) depth and power. This season seems like shallow people trying to act deep, in other words, posers or maybe high schoolish, something that would play after Teen Wolf. Not my cup of tea so rather than pursue this season I will wait until I have some time to waste and catch it on Hulu or some such thing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Having watched three episodes so far, I find the writing and the new doctor to be just dreadful.  What a bitter disappointment.  And I thought season 7 was bad. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Moffat's Doctor Who is Prettier on the Outside but Stupider on the Inside.

I have been watching Doctor Who almost my entire life from the first episode with the first Doctor (William Hartnell – 1963). The original concept of the show was to be a children’s’ science show. As it matured, Doctor Who became the thinking person’s sci-fi show. It had almost no budget and no special effects but it did have incredibly good writing with meticulous internal logic. This is what saved the show from its reliance on tinfoil and toilet plungers.

Now the show appears to be in the opposite situation. The reboot of Doctor Who (2005 to present) has all the resources of modern CGI technology and a decent budget but the writing for the past four years has been desperately in need of a toilet plunger. Episode after episode, logic is thrown out into the vortex leaving massive plot holes in the fabric of space and time. Situations that could be explained logically in one or two lines are simply left unexplained or attributed to vague miracles, mysteries or happenstance. Characters repeatedly die and come back as if they were soap opera stars. Why the absence of coherent plots? Why the lazy short cuts? Why write the show into crazy corners in the first place? One needs only to go back and watch a few episodes of the Troughton or Pertwee or Tom Baker or Tennant series to appreciate how the writing was mostly consistent with the show’s canon and the characters.

Under Moffat’s leadership there hasn’t been a single episode that has been free of logical gaps, implausible twists and unbelievable resolutions. The key to good fantasy/science fiction is helping your audience suspend their disbelief. I’ve tried really hard to be carried along by the story and the superb acting performances but the clumsy writing and jarring plot holes keep throwing buckets of water on my suspended disbelief bringing it crashing to the ground. In contrast, the seasons helmed by Russell T. Davies (2005-2010), though not without flaws, were consistently logical. The 9th and 10th Doctors (Christoper Eccelston and David Tennant) explained the science (or imagined science) behind even the most complex and bizarre situations – often at lightening speed. Belief was not only easy to suspend it was positively buoyed up by the combination of well-crafted scripts and brilliant performances. Then Davies left and took his beautiful, logical, lightening prose and gave it to Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes (2010 – 2014). Doctor Who has been a tongue-tied, fumble-footed shadow of its former self ever since.

Most recent case in point – the 2014 Christmas special. The mash-up of Alien/the Thing/Inception/Miracle on 34th Street – self-consciously acknowledged in the leaden dialogue – featured face-hugging dream crabs that drink your brain while placing you in a dream state within a dream state within a dream state. There was no effort made to explain the basic premise of the episode: there are dream crabs – only six of them – on earth – on Christmas day. What are these dream crabs? Where did they come from? Why did they suddenly show up on earth and why did they attack only these six people? None of this is ever explained. The season finale before this special saw the grand villain, Missy, revealed as the Master – in the form of a woman (a sop to those disappointed in the casting of yet another white male Doctor) transferring the consciousness of the newly dead into cybermen (the go-to re-hash threat  for the uninspired). How the Master survived his/her apparent destruction several seasons back was never explained. He/she apparently was destroyed this time but who knows – maybe it was all a dream-crab induced fantasy.

The question is why has the show been allowed to disintegrate to this point? The reason Doctor Who became relevant was because the plots were so strong and the premises were airtight. It stood the test of time because the internal logic was respected. What the show has gained in techno-wizardry it has lost in essential good sense and plausible scientific foundations. It is coasting on the fumes of bizarrely uncritical fan adulation.

Moffat has offered good scripts in the past under the direction of Davies. Is he stretched too thin as the director and show-runner? Is he farming the scripts out? Or has the show been purposely dumbed down to appeal to a more mainstream (i.e. North American) audience? Perhaps Moffat has been attacked by the mysterious dream crabs and is incapable of writing himself out of the dream state.

Here’s a new year’s resolution for Steven Moffat that I hope he will take to heart: Hire a serious writing team and bring back the science and logic of Doctor Who. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I had high expectations. I was excited to see Capaldi as a doctor, but the writing is horrendous, and the Doctor has died inside. Ecleston was serious, with plenty of wit an sarcasm. Tenant was emotional, humorous, and a perfect dash of energy and excitement. Smith was quirky, funny, witty, child-like, with moments of emotional rawness. For example, a Town Called Christmas.  Capaldi's Doctor is rarely funny, seems unattached to any characters, is dark, grumpy, and occasionally emotionally appealing. Honesty, I grew more attatched to the War Doctor than Capaldi. I could live with Capaldi as an okay doctor, if it weren't for the terrible writing.

What happened to the writers? The plot in season 8 had very little overarching conflict, unconvincing story, and seems to have been shoddily taped together, like a dinner party of Mad Libs for screenwriters. The plot is simply boring, trying too hard, and alienates viewers by being dark with influences of horror movies, with no humour. Sure, previous seasons had the occasional episode, such as Silence in the Library, but many season 8 episodes are dark, with no humour, and simply shambled together.

I really hope season 9 is better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This series is fast becoming a dull outing and I'm sure it's American following will part ways soon at this pace!
This is how season 8 part 1 has performed.
Ep 1 average E2 poor E3 dreadful E4 above average E5 best in series E6 dreadful E7 dreadful
I would almost say this is the worst season so far since the doctors return.
Check back later for season 8 part 2! Will it redeem it's self or crash and burn. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

People judge the new doctor for being old, but that is not a problem. What is a problem however, is the writers absolutely slaughtering everything the show ever stood for. The new episodes like "Listen" are full of plot holes, and quite frankly it's becoming a soap opera. The companion: "Clara", is taking centre stage and she certainly isn't as interesting as the 2000 year old Time Lord. The humour attempts are as dry as a bone, and we are just not seeing much of the new doctor's personality. The past ones have had a lot of depth of character, and practically none of that has been seen yet. Even the "anger" he is supposed to be famous for is rather weak. It is not Capaldi's fault though, new writers are required because Steven Moffat has well and truly lost his touch, and the show is nothing like classic Doctor Who or the previous modern seasons of the show; it's worse than nearly all of them. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Following a 50 year tradition, Doctor Who has had its ups and downs. This season was particularly unfruitful, taking away characteristics of the Doctor that made the show so entertaining. Though that is not all to be blamed as the scripts and episodes also fell short of grand expectations held by long time fans. As Season 9 approaches we hope for a better start to the new Doctor. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terribly disappointing, and bordering insulting. It's clear that the show is at its lowest point since the reboot. The Doctor's character manages to be awkward without the charm, character relations are weak across the board, certain sound effects made me cringe, dialogue is boring and appears to be written by mediocre high-school students, attempts at comedy fail 90% of the time, and themes are being repeated ad nauseam at this point. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Season 8 is quiet bad as far as writing and directing/editing goes, We are 10 episodes in and the the back stories is just missing or so bad they don't make sense. With leak of the episode scripts before the start of the season  i can only hope that the reason for all the problems with episode storyline has to do with someone trying to change the episodes to make it into something different in post production and has failed hopelessly.

Peter Capaldi looks to be another good doctor, that's if they can find writers & scripts to suit the new doctor's style not just squeeze into scripts for the old ones. This has always been the way the doctor keeps fresh and current to the times.

No matter how good the 8th doctor (Paul McGann) was, he could not save that intolerable bad script in that movie and so it is with this season 8.  i hope Peter Capaldi has better success with season 9  because this one is a lost cause. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I used to praise Steven Moffat's writing, but he has lost his touch. Capaldi as a declawed Malcolm Tucker, while novel, can't save this mess. With such grim drama, the Doctor can't be sour 24/7. Clara is THE WORST COMPANION in the new series: a moody, needy, bossy, lying, backstabbing witch who thinks a crooked smile can fix anything. Some of the plots were ok, some so dumb that you'd need the brains of a baked potato to enjoy them (the one where the moon hatches and lays an egg bigger than itself comes to mind). Funny that the Robin Hood episode was one I had the least problem with, at least it was unafraid to be fun. This show used to be fun. It was about The Doctor being clever and getting out of jams on alien worlds and exotic time periods by his wits and a smile and a good traveling chum. Now it's all about the companion's relationship melodrama.

I was never on the bandwagon that said Moffat's ruining the show until this season, and in fact Doctor Who Series 5 and 6 are two of my favorite seasons of any show ever. But he has dropped the ball horribly.

The lizard and ninja are married, we know. Have them exchange tongues, then tell us 20 more times how the lesbians are married. That's all fine, but sometimes the BBC likes to pummel your head with their social agendas and it takes you right out of this FAMILY show.

So about the finale... It isn't enough that Clara flat out betrays Twelve in the volcano--no matter how annoying they sometimes got to me, the companion at least always had the Doctor's back... until now. But then we actually start the second half with Jenna's name first and her big lemur eyes, as if to confirm The Doctor is a sidekick on his own show.

Oh look, Twelve is President of Earth now. That doesn't go against the hero's ethics at all, a despot ruling an entire planet.

Making The Master a woman was a cheap gimmick and obviously greasing the rails for a female Doctor that EVERYONE is screaming for (so the loudest new fans who don't understand the show and a clueless showrunner want you to think). She shoves her tongue down The Doctor's throat. What kind of Freudian nightmare is this? For every old Master episode, I can just imagine what the Master really wants to do to The Doctor. From brotherly rivals to starcrossed lovers. Yuck.

I love women, and hope they bring on more strong and interesting NEW characters like River Song. I don't hate on other sex preferences in life. But stop ruining established characters for ratings just because you are out of original ideas--reminds me of that series that made John Watson a Chinese woman for lack of a better idea. Watch this show tank and need another reboot if they give us The Doctorette, don't say we didn't see that massive misfire coming. "Be a queen, yeah that would be good too..." Oh dear.

Missy is the most annoying actress possible, playing the Master as a woman with no explanation why, with a plan involving Clara and Cybermen that amounts to bugger-all. If her plan was to give Twelve an army, why did she leave him to die on the plane? “Every man, woman, and child who ever lived” is now a Cyberman. Well that’s offensive on multiple levels. Even poor Abe Lincoln is a zombie bot now. The Earth would be wall-to-wall Cybermen if EVERY person who ever died came back, but just throw in a gibberish line and don't think about it.

Not only was The Doctor useless in the end, he was proven wrong and made a fool of by the tedious Danny Pink. What are they doing to our beloved character?

He's not a good man or a hero, Twelve says, he's an idiot. If a hack writer was paid to ruin DW's legacy beyond recognition, he couldn't do a better job of it than Moffat is doing. "Never trust a hug. It's just a way to hide your face." OK. I'm all for trying on a new personality for Twelve, but adding an unlikable guy (great actor though) to horribly insultingly dumb stories and an unbearable companion with a soap opera dating life... and the show is broken. I didn't even bother seeing the Christmas episode. And goodie for us, the series' worst companion changed her mind and is coming back. Guess I won't be. She can at least stop slapping or threatening to slap The Doctor. That'd be nice, someone who doesn't resort to violence and threats every time she disagrees with our hero.

So the deadline was looming and Moff just lazily thought bringing a kid back from the dead, after many years, with a magic bracelet was a good way to end it. :/

So then end a two-parter all about dead people not being dead, feeling their bodies being burned to ash, bringing back 50 year old corpses of old characters (um, I have a few questions about all this bringing back the dead business, but oh, it's over) with Twelve and Clara lying to each other again, sourfaced, and cap it with a goofy Santa scene. I see Moff went to the George Lucas school of misplaced humor.

NO MORE. Get a new showrunner, soon, this one already peaked and is killing Doctor Who. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm into episode 7 of season 8 and I still am not pleased with the changes.  With all the past seasons I am glued to the TV every second. This season, not so much.  Not sure if it's the writing or the characters but i'm bored.  This was my favorite show on TV. I really hope it gets better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Thrones has no direction.  Nothing has happened all season.  Huge disappointment.  Writing sucks.  When the books ended  everything went downhill.  It  will take more than boobs to kick start this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm reading the first book and I'm about 200 pages in, so all of this plot is still very fresh in my mind for what I just saw on Episode 1. I don't understand why this show has such high reviews...perhaps the obscene amounts of gore and nudity? I only watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and that is all I will watch, for reasons I will make known below. Before that, I would like to state that this series may reflect the book, but it taints the reputation of the book and the reflection is not accurate in the least bit.

Characters: First of all, the ages of all the children are older than in the books...which I'm assuming will make nudity of the girls...more acceptable to the audience??? Jon Snow is not at ALL what I pictured him to be...I mean it gives a physical description of him in the book...so there's no excuse for that. However, most other characters do look a lot like I would have imagined (esp. Arya and Ned), just not Jon.

When the show began it completely butchered the scene of the Night Watch men who encountered the Others. The wildlings on the ground were not butchered and the man who deserted after the encounter only survived because he climbed up a tree. I know that seems like a small deviation, but for a series that claims to be so close to the book, the opening scene was screwed up. The execution of the deserter was handled well, but what about Bran's big question? Following the execution, the direwolves scene was mishandled as well. The actor playing Jon did not look as though he was caught off guard by finding the runt. Speaking of that, all of the plot was rushed much too much. The actors failed at capturing the nuances, pauses, and facial expressions that these characters make. I was frustrated throughout the whole episode because it seemed to rush to the nudity, which is FAR LESS IMPORTANT than, say, the scene where Ned and Robert were underground paying respects to the dead. That scene deserved more than it was given. They didn't bring Robert and Ned's relationship to life, instead they make Robert look like a man-whore and they made him look soft (as in fat is whole life). The king should be hardened, but with a softness that only Ned can bring out in him...Mark Addy is NOT Robert Baratheon. No, no, no. I'm so mad at myself for watching this because now all of the faces of the characters will be associated with the actors...Boo!

The sex scene with the Imp and all of the whores was completely fabricated...I mean that was just completely unnecessary. So many people are stating that this series handles sex maturely, but it takes something sacred and makes it absolutely disgusting. The book did not handle sex this way at all! Also, Daenerys is supposed to be a 13 year old virgin and the show had the actress who played her take part in two obscenely long nude scenes. I'm sorry (not really), but that actress does not act very innocent or afraid and I don't think she can because she is too willing to pull her drawers down. The sex scene between her and Drogo was not handled well either because it made Drogo seem way more barbaric than he actually is in the book (according to that specific scene in the book). They didn't have time to throw in the fact that he tenderly asked her for permission? I mean, really? That scene in the book ended in mutual agreement...(well as much as possible considering the circumstances). Now, the sex scene of Cersai and her brother was pretty much dead on for the book...I will admit that much.

Pros: The costumes, props, and scenery are somewhat nice. That's it. You can't build up a show on nice backdrops and cool clothing though.

Overall impression:

-The necessary scenes were rushed.
-Important details were completely neglected.
-Some characters are all wrong and the ages of the children are fudged.
-Sex has devolved into a barbaric act of overpowering women.
-Most of the nudity is unnecessary and is OVERWHELMINGLY uneven (all full-on naked women)
-Props and scenery are nice.
-Whorehouse scene completely fabricated.

PLEASE READ THE BOOK. You'll understand why so many of the people who read the book are angry.

Now I'm off to read the book some more, but I think I've made it quite obvious that this show has dragged down my overall "A Game of Thrones" experience. I don't even know if I'll finish it now, but I definitely won't be back to watch this ridiculous adaptation of it.

Last words:
The actress playing Daenerys is so beyond wrong. I actually feel bad for the made-up character in the book!

BLEH! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How is it that no one has pointed out how despicable the writing is for this show.  I can think of no lazier device to convey a character's thoughts than the monologue to no one, but in S2E1 they did it no less than three times.  The dialogue is borderline retarded, and they insist on having each character do the dumbest thing possible at all times.  Why he hell did that little girl get out from under the car when the zombie herd hadn't passed by more than 5 seconds ago?!  That wouldn't happen.  Why would that idiotic blond woman who always has a stupid look on her face be fumbling in the bathroom clanking metal pieces together while simultaneously trying to hide from a zombie!?  She wouldn't!  There's just so much stupidity that goes on with this show that its hard to take and its really a shame that they're turning such great source material into such drivel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

is Dallas back? really disappointed with season 2 , no action no suspense, just blablba and sex and pregnancy , zombies themselves are so bored than they don't attack them anymore 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm still incredibly surprised that it has been well received by critics.It has an exceptionally farfetched storyline but I had to excuse it since it was being touted as an Americanized telenovela.I eventually decided to watch this show after it scored two Golden Globe nominations and one win this year but found myself completely disliking the show. There is little to like about it except for the narrator and Jane's hilarious father whom I think deserved the Golden Globe win or nomination more than the show nor Gina Rodriguez (no offence to this year's Best Actress in A Comedy winner but I would not have pegged her to rob many veteran actresses in her category with her performance which was not exactly anything to shout about).The show is an hour long and there are more than twenty episodes in a season thereby meaning that there would bound to be many filler episodes where the plot or an arc would be going nowhere. It didn't take long for that to happen. Three episodes in and I'm already wishing that it was only a half hour show like most comedies are.Sure there are some dramatic elements to it too but when we strip everything down, this is a comedy that exists solely on over-exaggeration, not only in terms of the acting but in terms of its various plots and subplots. I don't even recall its most commonly compared to show "Ugly Betty" (RIP) being that bad or trying way too hard. I can't for the life of me imagine this show seeing an expiration date beyond two seasons at most.Its Golden Globe win and unfathomable rave reviews from critics has probably rescued it from near death as it was already being warned about getting the axe in its early weeks. There are many great comedies that have not survived a season let alone a couple episodes but this one surprisingly has. I have quit watching it to save myself an hour that I could probably use to actually sit down and better focus on doing my nails or something which I find myself doing one time too many while having the show on in front of me. I'll also need to remind myself not to trust any new hip show that the critics are raving so much about. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is an incredibly pathetic attempt to paint those in the armed forces as either incompetent, antisocial or inconceivably dumb. The point is clear: the writer doesn't like the war in Iraq. Ok, we get it. Thank God it's only seven episodes. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Mildly entertaining at times, but clearly created, written, and directed by people who have no idea how the military operates. The characters are the standard military cliche you would expect in a subpar series like this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Certainly starts well, but quickly degenerated into a confusion of crime thriller with teenage type comedy. Script lacked tightness and development, instead remaining lightweight and superficial. What a waste of Timothy Olyphant. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I started out liking this show but I must have been confused thinking it was a western-type police show.  Although I like the main character it seems it has morphed into nothing but a never ending soap opera as I haven't seen "the Marshall" do any investigating or arresting in the last three shows.  I am old-fashioned in liking shows that the good guys win and the show has a conclusion after one hour.  No longer on my list. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I dont get it. Ive watched 3 episodes now and I dont recognise any characters. A few things have been mildly interesting but the story seems completely disjointed. I simply cannot see one link between the current show and the previous ones. I'm not gripped and not even sure I'll have time to watch this ever again 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry. One episode will have to be the limit as a reviewable sample. If annoying your viewership is the same as being funny then this show is hilarious. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love Damages but not this season. While S1 and S3 were well thought out, well paced and built up to a satisfying finale, this season was overly complicated, too many characters and an ending that just seemed put together with no real planning behind it. It would be useful also if people didn't rush to give Damages a 10 score after one opening episode! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show was literally painful to watch- and trust me, I love dark comedies- I love all kinds of comedies- but this just wasn't funny to me. The pace is unbearably slow and the humor is often juvenile and/or contrived. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first episode was really funny and skewered hipster culture really well.  It's all a bit lo-fi and the characters felt real.

After the second episode it really sags and the lack of charisma or charm or interest makes the main characters really uninteresting.  The lo fi ness of it all starts to feel amateurish and it feels like a shoddy student production after a while.

Honestly you're better off not watching it to the end for the implausible and underwhelming denouement.  Turgid and limp. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Take away the costumes, set and cinematography, and you have an overacted and overwrought movie of the week. The writing is actually embarrassingly bad at times, and it's obvious that Hooper couldn't control his actors' performances. A dressed-up sappy love story, masquerading as History - with a capital H. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great acting from Krysten Ritter and Rachael Taylor, but everything else is laughable - particularly the plot. What begins as a relatively stable premise quickly degenerates into mindless violence and repetitive episodes that do little to build a fulfilling narrative. The show ens up like 'Lost' - the meat is stipped from the bone, leaving only traces of flesh at the beginning and end of the episode - what happens in between is usually unimportant or uninteresting.

There is a great episode in the middle of the series, which explores the psychology and philosophy behind both characters and plot. This one episode is the only episode I can really recommend. The build up to this episode is stretched too long, and the final episodes are awfully inconsistent. The writers even fail to maintain the realism of the everyday world, and the characters begin to fall apart and act hypocritically.

The concept was a promising one, and some episodes show promise - but often, the conclusion is an explosion and a lot of mindless violence. I cannot understand why this has been so well received. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If I was that confused I would have just changed my pants. Forget about any superheroes when welcoming Jessica Jones 50 shades of twlight.

She doesn't know what she is, instead we have some emo wannabe pulling cockroaches out of her hair. Queue snarly monotone dribble about something something shadow's haunting her. Nevermind how any bleak drab undertones are all over the place trying too distance themselves further from reality in producing a comic, so it instead attempts some other drama.

Anybody else want to guess what this show was about? I have given up. The genre is absolutely wrong for the show's theme, it is so ground in drama it cannot be classed as anything else, despite of any outlining comic book story. There is no horror despite of whatever attempted surealism, no Noir just because she has a case of the fairies, it doesn't make this exploitation, if there interracial sex and other confused bisexuality. No thriller if I am bored to death. And she barely fits into her make-up style either when shown like this. If what she has got is a big chip on her shoulder turning into a superstrength Hyde protecting other ho's from abuse, and in her spare time living in crackhouse offering up her PI.  Where is her pain, what is her pain? It wasn't even properly explored and fully haunted, instead we are bombarded with what the show thinks of other reality, within that underbelly, but it was never even fully aware that this was a comic book.

Krysten Ritter is divine, David Tennant is superb, but the writing (dialogue) and directing (pace) leave oh so much to be desired. There was only just enough of interest to tease me and my wife into watching, waiting, hoping that at some point things would gel and the remaining episodes would blow us away. It never happened. When Kilgrave finally got his in the end we were mostly relieved we just wouldn't have to spend any more time to find out how. You know it's bad when you're through 11 of 13 episodes and seriously consider if you care enough to watch the final two. As many others have noted, it was just too long; it could have been a full eight episodes. At thirteen they've just fluffed. Do we really need a throng of supporting cast to exhibit and explore all the differing degrees, variations, shades and techniques of controlling, abusive relationships? Half a dozen couples in the series suffer the same co-dependency problems, deal with them more or less badly, and preach the same moral on personal dysfunctionality. Ho, hum. Meanwhile, crippling levels of alcoholism are no more debilitating than last year's sneakers. So much acting talent, wasted. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have a simple question, at what point during first season does Jessica Jones become watchable? I'm 3 episodes in and the show is basically an electronic sleeping pill. I like Krysten Ritter and I'm a big fan of David Tennant. But I'm not joking when I say that to date I've not been able to stay awake for an entire episode. I'm not a fan of  Daredevil but I can at least stay awake during the show.  A couple more questions is how did Marvel fail so hard on this show? And why do people claim that Jessica Jones is so good when it's one of the dullest things on Netflix? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Watching the pilot made me feel like I was reading a book and missing chapter 2-10, and then had all the characters talk about those chapters. The big difference between a show like this and a show like "Lost" or "Twin Peaks," is that this time, it's not just the writers or a few individuals that know more than the viewers, it's the whole cast. I don't feel like I'm being let in on something, I feel like I'm being teased. That might happen after a while with a show of this nature, but It shouldn't happen in the pilot. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Well if it's for fans of Superbad then count me out. The show is basically this, hot girl,guy with powers, old devil guy, fat annoying comic relief friend and bam, theres your show..Wait I just listed almost every show on CW, right(Smallville,Supernatural,Tyra), or was it Fox? Anyway, really boring show, a joke here and there but nothing special, It's strange what passes for a funny show these days. Most of the "punch lines"(felt like punch lines) just stood out there too long, making the show a little un-easy to watch. Most of the jokes that are played up, start with DUDE, dude your neo, dude your the one.And most of the smart writhing that i would like to see more are played down,I'm guessing CW wants us Drunk 20 somethings tuning in every week, so they naturally have to tone the smart down. Once again really stupid show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Zombies!! Are you kidding!! At first I thought it was a comedy plot, after a while I realized that it was not, but could not see the drama, so I goggled it and found it was a Terror TV Series!!! Those zombies scare less than a golden retriever puppy!!! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is Soap Opera.... not T.V series The Bold and the Beautiful Meets Southern Cowboys!!!! Intentional drama, is not good drama.... Its a show you turn the T.V on just to pass time... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Why do independent filmmakers always thinks the audience is super interested in watching the main characters for minutes in closeup, staring into the distance, doing nothing, and then have the audacity to pretend that this is telling us anything about the complex emotional state of the character?? The premise was enticing and had great promise, I was bored to death by this ordeal of a pilot with stereotypical figures and a director who replaces dialogue with music and expression with meaningless closeup glances. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This was utterly disgusting. We get it, Louis, you're a New York liberal. The rest of the world doesn't want to hear a comedy special about a woman being allowed to kill babies because "THEY'RE IN DER BAJAYJAY LOL XDDDDDDD"

This guy's lost the plot. I wish I hadn't watched it, as I previously liked Louis CK. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How does this get a user rate of 8.4? Cool zombies, good special effects in that respect, but but but! Clunkily written pure melodrama with one-dimensional STUPID characters that we don't care about. Look up over-acting and you'll see a picture of the crazy rednecks and the roided up dude. Why the hell are they camping up on a hill surrounded by deep forest? Anyone think of 'establishing a perimeter'? Get to work building trenches and walls, people! My daughter and I were chanting "Zombies, Zombies" for minutes on end as we endured the drawn out scenes where the zombie-like non-zombies expressed their feelings. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Are you people on crack? Some of the worst acting I have ever seen, including one of the worst shows. Is this show a comedy? 'What would happen if Zombies took over the world, leaving nothing but white trash behind?" Seriously. W.T.F. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I try really hard to like this show, since it has always gotten such good reviews and it's actually so popular, another reason for me trying is because I've always liked zombies, so this is a first. I find it to be one the worst tv shows I've watched, the plot is dull, the acting isn't the best and I definitely believe this show is highly overrated. It has gotten to the point of annoyance. I hate it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

When I see "critically acclaimed" and then see 3 seasons of emptiness with zombies, I have to wonder, who are this critics...

The Walking Dead is probably one of the worst series I managed to keep watching, why? Because it has zombies and everyone likes a survivalist zombie story, so I keep watching it hoping that it will improve, but then I saw the first episode of season 4, and nothing changed.

Characters:
They don't look like people, they look like zombies, they are that empty, the best characters are those who fall into the cliche category, because at least they are something.

Nonsense:
The amount of nonsense is just staggering. The decisions of the group are so stupid and ridiculous it makes me facepalm constantly. An example, character X goes on a supply run which is expected to last a day, character Y for absolutely no reason decides that after 1 hour, 1 hour!!! that someone should go see if character X is alright, OMG! The problem is that this nonsense is prevalent through all the seasons.

Learning Curve:
The characters have no learning curve, they are just as stupid as they were in the very first episode, they keep doing the most ridiculous mistakes over and over again.

More nonsense:
The world is almost empty of survivors, yet, they can't find a damn good car, they keep using 70's cars instead of, I don't know... maybe some bad ass HUMV? Maybe a truck? Anything that isn't the worst possible choice please?

And more nonsense:
Yes let's use old bolt action rifles, because in the USA, one of the most armed countries in the world, there's no better solutions, national guard is gone, everything is gone, but there's no good weapons, the cookie monster took them away and ate them. In all fairness this improved in the last season.

Zombies:
The slowest and dumbest zombies ever made, its just amazing how the characters over-complicate everything. And then there's the magic zombies who all of a sudden show up from nowhere.

And even more nonsense:
You have an entire forest, where there's a small pack of zombies moving through. You are "cloaked" from them, they can't smell you and they are going the same route as you are. Apparently there's two choices, you go through any other forest path, or you go into the middle of the horde and go with them. What would you chose? Be in the middle of a horde of flesh eating monsters or not? The characters in this series seem to think that being in the center of the horde is the most viable and sane choice.

This series really took a new step into the realm of silliness, there's no story, no characters, no learning, no evolution, no horror, no fear, no empathy, absolutely no realism at all. There's very little to like, acting is ok, scenarios are fine, and that's pretty much it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the show I wanted so bad to love. I watched the entire first season waiting for things to get interesting. Then I was told that it gets better and to keep watching. So I watched Season 2. Now I'm being told Season 3 is "even better!" No thanks. The acting is terrible, the writing wooden, and the plot bumbles from one big reveal to another, each trying harder than the last to shock me into caring. But I don't.

If you're looking for shocking moments that actually matter, try Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad. If you want horror, try Hannibal or early seasons of Supernatural. If you want zombies, just watch Night of the Living Dead or Dawn of the Dead. Don't want this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

That series sucks. Why? The story is so artificial and cliche.

- First at episode 2, just when they are passing the walkers starts rain. Just when cant rain. You watch 20 episodies, and never rain!
- At episode 4, the fight with the others is without reason, is stupid. At same episode the final is so dramatic too. The walkers are more slow than my grandmother, then the girls stop and waits to be bitten. She dont defend her self, and start scream after bite.

- Mille cut of his hand to escape? Oh my god, that was so original! I doubt that a saw can cut off a hand but cant cut the link of the handcuff.

- Most episodes have much pointless drama, like a soap opera. Is note a action series, is a drama novel.

- The car stolen, the sport one. Is that true, just go there and steal? The gas is ok? The batteries too?

To me, after play last of us, stories like that is pointless and artificial. Like i said, is a dramatic novel for ladies, a soap. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Another post Apocalyptic series. Nothing original or creative in this series. I still watch the series due to its story but its just another one next to the others. If you watched Resident Evil before, then this is like the TV series of it. The Walking Dead is a decent show but the hype is ridiculous. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show sucks. The first couple episodes were okay, but it has been downhill from there. The show's attempts at character development are soo weak. And there are so many moments that bore me to tears. Like the overly long scene where husband and wife are reunited and cuddling in the tent, and the never-ending scene where one sister mourns the death of the other. Keep it moving guys. No one cares about these people. We want to see a plot, we want to see action, and we want to keep it moving. These abundant and overly long scene edits are obviously designed to take up time, save money, and make up for the lack of plot developing scenes. Boring. Great to hear that all the writers from season one have been canned, but the real problem is a lack of planning and/or no real script. I'm tuning out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maggie, as always, is lovely.  And one of the world's best, Stephen Rea, seems well cast.

It seems to have everything, except:

1. Lighting for the scenes, and

2. A frikkin' PLOT

It works out to be leCarre on Seconal

I was TIVO-ing it to avoid Sundance's horrid intrusions.....but find it best suited as an insomnia cure.

Trendy....you bet.    Artsy....I guess.    Pretentious....abso-foookin'- lootely.

But watchable.....nah........ 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Man, who giving this grades??? the Season 2 sucks as hell!!! the first was cool, but Season 2??? Worst TV Shown ever! Stop wathing in the 5th episode! Yes, I tried to keep wathing, but sucks hell!! Dont watch it! C'mon Netiflix I know you can do better! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really, really wish this show was funny. I liked the first few episodes of season 1, but then it lapsed into an absolute void of humor. The writers seem to think that having characters say and do outrageous, ridiculous things moment to moment is funny. How is that funny in itself? There needs to something clever, no? Can we at least have an attempt at being clever, rather than just random? Random craziness is child's work.

I would just like to sit with all the users and the critics who rate this so highly and see if they actually laugh. And if they do, I'd like them to try to explain it to me so I can diagnose their malady. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Honestamente no se lo que haya la critica en esta serie... entiendo que sea algo creativo en cuanto a historia pero en su ejecución esta comedia debió haber salido en los 90 (Aunque de ser así sus referencias no serían nostalgicas).
Desde la primer temporada no se avanza mucho, los personajes apenas se desarrollan y tienden a andar en círculos, continuando con su humor barato que es posible gracias a que el universo donde se desarrolla "Unbrekable Kimmy Schmidt" esta conformado por una humanidad estúpida.
Le doy puntos debido a que hubo un episodio que si me gustó "Kimmy Gives up!", que es robado por la banda sonora interpretada por Titus (Tituss Burgess). 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

a very entertaining and well directed Ep01 up to the final and grotesque fighting scene, where (as usual) SEAL snipers literally can't hit a grandmother walking slowly across a forest area. Ep02 is such a disappointment because the typical and excruciatingly boring superhero tropes reemerge amid a very thin plot. That and the terrible acting of the lead character and the one-dimensional Aubrey-Look I'm kuku-Plaza...I stopped watching 2 minutes in.
Bye.... sadly 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Apparently you only need to say mutant in a TV series and it automatically gets a 10. Legion is repetitive and boring. Almost nothing has happened in 5 episodes. Apart from the lead, there's minimal character development, leading to very dull characters. I think the quirkiness is supposed to make Legion interesting, but it doesn't, it makes it stupid. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What's up with the injection of politics and constant attacks on religion? Why not discuss evolution and present the scientific case without attacking intelligent design? Why describe CO2 as a poisonous gas when it is necessary and indeed promotes all plant life, which in turn is the food source for practically all animal life?

The irony is that the show repeatedly chastises Christianity for its doctrinaire approach, yet the show and its host fail to see that they are behaving the exact same way.  I guess it's just too tough to persuade people with logic, so the show just falls back on political manipulation and disrespectful stereotyping. What a lost opportunity to have a meaningful discussion! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm very disappointed. Really cheap and cheesy graphics. The progression feels very rushed. The storytelling is fragmented. The music is at times poorly mixed, and annoying. I am a huge fan of Neil Degrasse Tyson, and I was hoping for something better than this. Surely the producers could have given him something more to work with than this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've just watched the third episode, and I have to say that overall, I'm deeply disappointed.

The show is an almost non-stop and overt attack on theology. I'm not defending religion; I generally abhor it. But I feel that the show is giving religion too much power by working so hard to refute it, and short-shrifting science in the process. It makes me wonder if Ann Druyan has had to deflect attacks from the religious right over the last few decades, and this show is the product of that conflict.

There's almost no science in this science show. What little there is, is empty and shallow. Everything has been dumbed-down and Tyson's narration seems to meander and dance around the science without seizing the opportunity to put a fine point on it. For me at times, the dialogue seemed to be just background noise lost against the CGI, and the whole things seems to lack any cohesive structure.

They even ended episode two with animation and Sagan's narration from the original series. That 60 seconds was better than anything else done in the whole of these three episodes.

"These are just some of the things molecules can do, given 4 billion years of evolution."
- Carl Sagan

Now that's just not dialogue, it's poetry. It is at once succinct and eye-opening/mind-blowing; and the new series hasn't come anywhere close to it. Sagan's delivery was full of awe, wonder, and humility. Tyson's delivery by contrast seems more like a bravado "I got this." Certainly Tyson has earned the chance to pick up where Sagan left off, but I think the new Cosmos would have been in better hands with Brian Edward Cox.

I'll probably still watch it and hope beyond hope that it will improve. They have 10 more episodes so I have to think they will go in-depth about...something.

Oh, and the animation used to depict historical events is beyond awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The series was an awful sequel to Carl Sagan's historic work. High-talking Tyson delivered a sixth-grade level clunker. Saturday mornings would have been the best times for airing it, along with the other cartoon shows.

Far too much time was spent on the negative effects of religion upon scientific progress. Philosophy, not science, is the word I associate with this series.

This series was not about the Cosmos. A better title would have been, "History of the Human Race." 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Production quality is pretty good and there was a moment at the beginning that had some historical truth to it how the slaves were traded. Then, about 10 min into the show history was being re-written to match todays glorified politically correct point of view. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I was looking forward to seeing this new series. However, one of the most ludicrous parts was when Kunta told his parents he wanted to go to University!! So he set off on his horse, saw the girl he was in love with, and then was captured by the slavers.   Alex Haley had written that Kunta was in the forest getting some wood for a drum, when he was captured.  That is what actually happened.  How Levar Burton could allow this ridiculous university story instead is ridiculous.  Hopefully, the rest of the series will be closer to the truth, 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

An utter disappointment on almost every level. Season 1 started with a lot of potential, even though it was a bit rough around the edges. Season 2 had its moments, but suffered from unintentionally funny villains and trying way too hard to be more edgy and shocking than Game of Thrones (it went overboard with child and animal cruelty).

To say season 3 has a plot would be an overstatement. Now the characters are basically Linkin Park songs with legs, wallowing in their sorrow without doing anything interesting.  I felt like I wanted to shout "oh, grow up!" at the screen.

Sir Malcolm Murray is reduced to a passive secondary character in a pointless wild west story with Ethan. It's like John Logan said "oops! Timothy Dalton's contract was up for three seasons, but now I have no idea what to do with him". Same thing with Ecate, who is there to have sex with Ethan and that's about it.

We finally get to meet Dracula, who is laughably miscast, since he has as much personality and screen presence as a paper clip. I never bought for one second that he was the master of darkness the show makes him out to be. And in the process, Vanessa is turned into a glorified MacGuffin.

The stories with Dorian Gray, Lilly and Victor Frankenstein go absolutely nowhere, but well, I guess they really needed filler for 60 minutes. Not to mention that they're a pretty lazy attempt as social commentary.

To add insult to the injury, the last episode didn't do anything to redeem the season. We're supposed to believe that Vanessa, who spent the entire show fighting the forces of evil, gives up so easily? What exactly happened to Dracula? The woman with the knives is suddenly super important for the show even though she's only been there for a few episodes? No wolf-Ethan in the "epic" battle?

I only rate 2/10 because the acting and visuals remained great.

Dreadful indeed. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

They let this show fall apart and obviously had no plan after the first 2 seasons. Then they just ended it.
Terrible way to treat a show that had so much going for it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This has really devolved from the fresh concept & clever plotting/flash backs of the first series into a soap opera-esque chore to sit through in this third series.  Didn't work for me on any level. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I dont know what happened to this show. In season 3 i feel like there was no central plot. Just a bunch of subplots ranging from boring to mildly interesting. I feel like there was a ton of filler throughout, almost as if they knew people would binge watch, all they had to do was throw in some wow moments on occasion. I actually felt very bored for MOST of any given episode. I think if each episode was released once a week, the flaws of this season would be a lot more pronounced. All this season was just a ton of poorly developed subplots put together to form a tv show. Season 2 was very good and i expected big things from 3. It was very disappointing, and i hope it hurts the shows reputation so they actually show up to play for season 4. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So very disappointing vs seasons 1 & 2.  Not sure what happened to the writing team - did they go on strike or maybe the summer interns took over?  It was boring and painful to sit through 13 episodes (and each episode was longer to make it even worse).  Almost stopped watching when Donut guard raped one of the prisoners - please writers, you don't need to write in a rape scene into this show - there is enough of them on TV as it is and I'm raped out.  And what happened to CO Bennett?  Just left and no update at all?  WTF?  Last scene was silly. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Great dialogue and cool imagery don't make up for the incredibly poor quality of the mysteries. At it's core each week Pushing Daisy's is a who-done-it mystery. Only problem is, the mystery is contrived, impossible to follow and never rewarding. The writers need some help. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Although it is basically funny and entertaining Silicon Valley is quite homophobic. It would be appropriate if it was set in the early 90's or 1980's BUT it is now and seems So out of touch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is the most overrated show on tv. This show is absolutely horrible, it's unfunny and the plots suck. The Office is 1000 times better than 30 Rock could ever be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This season is such a huge let down.  The characters are running around making stupid and out of character decisions.  These are supposed to be hardened bikers are they not?  What father would just sit around calmly while his infant son was missing?  I'm not a hardened criminal but I'd start shooting people in the head until I got my son back and damn the consequences.  Getting an out of some serious murder charges and then throwing it all away by fleeing the country?  Jemma got raped and didn't talk and then she doesn't have enough self control to stay in the States until her charges were removed?  How many times did the Sons get ambushed in this season before they started to suspect that something was wrong?  Maybe the writers should put away the crayons.  This season is garbage. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show has turned into utter bollocks, the first two seasons were very good and paced really well, but this missing baby storyline is a joke, the characters have become overly sentimental and schmaltzy which is difficult to reconcile with the uncompromising action a show of this nature needs. Season 2 was more subtle and was a good examination of conflict tearing people apart, the characters were developing and were interesting, they have now turned into soundbite gimps, the creators have severely erred in trying to reconcile a fictional conflicts of a biker gang with a real world conflict of the IRA without any attempt to create even an iota a sense of realism or use skillful tact, (its difficult to see how a biker gang could make such in roads to the IRA when whole arms of government have tried and failed) The outcome of which is to turn a decent and interesting show into farce. In short the show has become boring in the end i stopped watching the show and looked on wiki for the outcome. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show's 2nd season is worst than the last I hated how they kept going with the I can't become famous in the media **** still trying to give a bleeding **** for these mostly losers. What I hated about this season is the fact that they made Ron dreams crash and burn and he ends up back at Party Down loser brigade, the indiviual catering stories went from being good to being raunchy **** ups that can't hardly past for decent  storytelling, and Adam Scott's character being the leader of the Party Down group is just a huge blunder. One line truly struck me in this season was the fact that the Casey character said she got rejected in America's media for being too JEWEY and you know that's a loaded piece of crap because in American media being too Jewey will always make you famous because Jews run the American media so that's just one of the worst lines I have heard ever!!!!!!!! Although there were good points in this mostly a huge wreck of a season with the adding of the truly talented Megan Mullally to the main cast, the fact that Martin Starr's character Roman was finally put in his place and you know what it was by none other than Steve Guttenberg who has been over since the 80's so that's an extra treat to the character Roman for someone to have finally stuck it to him, The gay football player draft episode, and the return of Jane Lynch/Constance Carmell in the show's series finale which I think  might have been the best thing of all in this entire season because that last episode's story was just PURE GENIUS. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Lena, You are indeed witty and charismatic, and the first season started off with a flurry of twist and turns exploring the beautiful and the grotesque aspects of young life here in New York. Unfortunately, I must say that this 2nd season has really made me cringe and is honestly so far from believable. Shock value no longer sells (at least as well as it used to). High on coke shirt off at Greenhouse with a bunch of glow stick kids isn't hip, fun, or even slightly cool. How did you even get past to door guy looking like a sweaty turd? Maybe you could have expanded upon that experience as there is nothing more real about New York than being denied club access because you look like crap. That would have been worth writing about... I understand this is a scathing review and I honestly hope it serves you well because bad reviews tend to full the fire. Good luck, I hope this show gets better for all of us...

Lena Dunham is quite talented and presented a fresh energy in her first season of Girls. However, season 2 is a total disappointment. From improbable sexual rendezvous that make no plot advancement (e.g., One Man's Trash), to innumerable, useless nude imageries, to obligatory racial diversity insertions, to Kardashian-esque, docu-soap, tween dramas, the season stalls in terms of originality and cleverness. As Dunham’s character struggles from a difficult breakup and youthful uncertainty, she burrows into a sexual oblivion that, in my opinion, is played out. This narrative is neither clever, original, nor amusing. Rather, the character behavior and plot summaries are reminiscent of an eastside Melrose Place. I find the season a discredit to Dunham’s artistic sparkle evident in the first season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Boring and not entertaining chicks drama.  Comparing to other HBO shows this one is one of the worse ones.
Who paid critics to give this high score to this 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

What I -- and most other folks -- loved about David Simon's "The Wire" was the writing, the stories.  Everything flowed from that.  "Treme" is "The Wire" without the writing.  Where is the tension?  When is the show going to break out of this slow (but beautifully filmed, beautifully acted, beautifully scored) journey?  Unless there is going to be a shift in its direction I can't imagine there will be another season.  Case in point:  John Goodman's Creighton Bernette drifted through season one without developing into a character we wanted to care about, and it wasn't John Goodman's fault.   Yes, we got the whole "I'm pissed what's happened to my city" schtick, but that was the extent of his character?  Really?  Bernette, and many of the other characters, come across as permanently one dimensional  -- more similar to characters in "Law and Order" than "Breaking Bad", the current gold standard for shows with great stories.With such as awesome cast (thank G-d Khandi Alexander's back on the TV) and a potential as wide and long as the MIssissippi, "Treme" could be much better, much much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No idea what the critics were smoking when the watched the first 3 episodes of Season 3 of Hannibal.  I loved the first 2 seasons, but this season is tedious crap!  Looks like the 4th episodes might pick up some steam, but I'm completely uninterested in whatever the writers are producing here. It's as if they're playing out the string at the viewers' expense. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hannibal fails when we want it to succeed. The problem is simple, Hannibal as we knew him was snarling at mediocrity, in this iteration everyone speaks perfectly , there is no color or contrast just lots of clever smart people saying and doing smart and elegant things. Hannibal doesn't seem magnificent anymore , he seems neutered. Where are the rubes? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really wanted to like this. I watched the first 4 episodes and in the end it just came across as one piece of depressing, badly acted , TV detective series. I am sure there must be some mystery to the whole thing but i could not fathom having to endure any more damp depressive dialogue. Awful, Awful, Awful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is example of how to really muck up any reality, turning what had started by being a casual ride, into completely laughable nonsense. Did they figure lets reel them in with a decent premise to than dismantle it all on the second season.

This show was way to lengthy to achieve any finale, drawn out to end degree's, had nobody employed an editor? The same scenes, information keep on running again and again to drawn out this shows duration...

The characters themselves were  bunch of misfits whom would never achieve professional positions. outside of attempted political correctness showing itself into every picture.  Believing suicidal, cripples, can gain the presidency, because they don't require an additional team of aids, who would be privy to national secrets, when making every single function accessible, to any man on a podium. Jeopardising those very positions power when upon making further demands of office. Also containing drugged AA, cops making detective, or institutionally insane cops being lead investigators. Because their ain't no such thing as public record. GBH is on bail, to do it all again without any ankle bracelet. The list is endless

What started off as a Twin Peaks esque, but wrongly set in the big city. Quickly descend into total emotional nonsense, utterly painfully to then watch the who did it. Upon final conclusion the person who did it, it was unlikely to be in their nature at all. Although we must likewise believe in the impossible that everybody is a natural born killer, when it comes to power.

Heck, I don't know if they tried to pull it back on the third season and the the fourth. I didn't care at all after the second.... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could have been a good show and Samantha had promise but proved to be what she portrays; mean spirited, snarky and biased.  Where does this sell?  I've not seen this approach work yet.  Stewart was close because seemed sincere but even he lost much of his early audience being overly biased.  I think he filled his studio with the same slap-happy seals with which Maher laces his seats.  You can't continue to be dishonest to the audience and expect them to return, even if they agree philosophically.  It gets embarrassing as a while.  Don't you guys see that? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

How this show is rated higher than a classic like The Wire is beyond me? The idea of using the same actors from Season 1 in radically different roles is interesting and the actors try hard with the material to their credit. But the material is lopsided and weak. One dimensional and painfully politically correct. That and the banal joylessness of the whole thing. Unsatisfying, unreal and out of touch. No season 3 for me. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I accidentally wrote this review for Season 1 (which I found pretty good actually). But HATE Season 2. It completely ran out of air around episode 5. Then all the other problems with it--unconvincing dialogue, contrived reactions, over-weaning earnestness--became completely unbearable. It was like they wanted to pack as many social issues into the show as they could. Every conversation is one note: intense and fierce and outraged. It wears thin. Actors do their best. It's technically very well done. But the writing is a disaster. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show by itself would be a good crime drama but lays to heavily on the Social Justice Warrior routine.  Goes too far out of the way to making you empathize or villain-ize characters specifically because of their race and not because of their character.  I'm going to go out an a limb and guess the murderer will be a straight white Christian male and we should feel bad for assuming it was someone else.

Tedious, pointless drivel.  Unlike the side characters, who are compelling, the two main characters are uninteresting in the extreme.  It. Is dull, dull, dull. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Medicore movie fell asleep through half of it, it has a target audience obviously and it will get good reviews based on being a gay movie, but if you took the gay out of this, its quite amateurish and full of kitsch and cheesy acting predictable acting. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Downton Abbey was a solid period soap opera in its first season.  Season two devolved into a lot of nonsense,   almost like bad daytime soaps.  Very disappointing. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I am disappointed in this Starz series. The plot had the viewer going in all different directions pointing strongly to a possible pedophile and to human trafficking for the sex trade. Key characters were suspect all throughout the series that had nothing to do with the disappearance of sweet Oliver. What was the point of that, as it led to great frustration from one episode to the next. In hind sight, there is no point to Ian and Victor being suspect, yet the movement of the series led you on to believe they had a definite role in Oliver's disappearance. They had suspicious behavior, for what? Twists and turns throughout that went nowhere. I would love one more episode that explains where the body is. And explain how Victor and Ian were actually involved all along. Hit by a car...seriously?? The actors did a great job. The plot  needed help. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This tedious, drawn out melodrama is difficult to watch. To be fair, we must give the actors credit for being able to act their parts credibly, given the stupidity of the characters they portray. It must at times have been embarrassing. The British writers get to portray the Irish protagonist as rash, irrational, emotional, and a drunkard, the French police as incompetent, the French public officials as corrupt, and the Scottish pedophile as contemptible and degenerate. The denouement is totally absurd and makes you realize that you have been played for paying Starz a premium to produce this rubbish. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you wanna whatch a show with black representation whatch How to get away with murder or orange is the new black or grey's anatomy. In these shows characters as rral human, on this one characters are forced. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

With surprisingly out of touch, low quality voice acting by Justin Roiland and very lousy, poor excuse for animation it's hard to recommend this show to anyone. Everything is forced and awkward that almost everyone on the show is wooden and draining. This is something that should be cancelled... Sorry to offend anybody but this is show is garbage and doesn't deserve such love. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Terrible show, despite swearing. All the women in this drama are portrayed as drunks, drug addicts, prostitutes, idiots, and worse. I can't believe that more viewers don't recognize the woman hating nature of Deadwood. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This 4 season is the biggest delusion of my life (as a TV watcher of course.) 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Seems the U.S. still hasn't had its fill of obnoxious English males whose typical facial expression suggests they're sniffing dog turd.   Frankly I do not understand the fascination with obnoxious trolls with upper class accents and vulgar trashy personalities.  I doubt anyone raised in an English household, like me, finds this stuff amusing.  Just brings back memories of rude uptight people who think their sh-t don't stink. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sat through two episodes before giving up on this series. The characters had zero appeal and it seems to be making fun of Minnesota natives by stereotyping them, instead a making them believable. Not worth it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holy cow is this show wretched bad, some of these 10s must be show staffers. My wife got up and left the room after 20 mins, while I plowed through to the bitter end. I heard from my dad the next day, who said he made it to the 3rd commercial break. I'm from MN, but spent 15 years on the E.Coast, and am back in MN now. So I have both the perspective of being a local, as well as having lived elsewhere and been privy to how others view us. The movie DID capture something about MN. When a beloved local theatre guy played the local sweeping the snow off his driveway, it was idiotic that the director forced him to use a broom (we don't sweep snow, we shovel it), but the dialogue ("kinda different") and accent were spot on. Marge too. Not so with this show, it's crap. The purported MN accents are bizarre and lame, all the "heck", "darn" & "uff da" (uff da, really???) dialogue is cheap & superficial. Saying things passive-aggressively and being non-committal, that's how Minnesotans talk. Fargo the TV show misses the mark completely, such a let down from a great movie. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Really feel like it's lost it's charm this season.  The songs are a bit of a throw-away and don't seem as integrated with the sets and story as they used to be.  It's like, time for a song, cut to a different set, let's shoot this song, now back to the story.  Last year, much more integration into the actual scene where characters would just start to break out into song in the midst of a scene, like it was a natural thing to do.  Songs also seemed more funny and clever last season, whereas this season they feel a bit forced.

Story is also beginning to struggle with the eventuality of being bogged down in a love triangle that swings back and forth, and back and forth, and reality.  The fun thing about this show was the absolute delusional fantasy that Rebecca was in and the struggle to maintain it and having Paula be right there with her.  The show is struggling a bit to find the magical sweetspot of last season. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show would be great but for the absolutely dreadful soundtrack and voice over. It makes the show unwatchable! After seeing the reviews I was looking forward to this one but it's simply dreadful! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Cutesy and contrived and heavy as lead. Not my cup of tea. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Maybe it's just me, but this show is like Tim Burton trying to do comedy. It isn't nearly as cute as it things it is and the whole AIDS-metaphor (they're in love but they can't touch, unless they're in full body condoms) seems really out of date. The narration is annoying beyond belief and everything seems to be a great idea in search of a show. It's already boring. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have to be honest here, when I first watched modern family I felt like I was watching a commercial until I saw the intro. the cameramen need to hold it in one place and the story line is just rubbish. not to mention the characters can be quite annoying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

One of the most overrated TV shows in history I hasn't once made me laugh and I have had to sit through nearly every episode, it contains too much American comedy which I guess as a Brit I clearly don't get but it wasn't like this with The Simpsons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

And yet another portrayal of supposedly smart people, as dumb doorknobs. Its old and tiring. Every movie, every tv show, and even US cartoons, portrays intelligence as stupid. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS IDIOT SAVANTS. They do not exist. There are times when someone stupid does something interesting by accident, but that is not what is happening in this show. Further, there is no such thing as a holly grail of lossless compression that is leagues better than other lossless compression designed for a specific data type... Seriously guys, get a clue. Its called the 1st and 2nd laws of thermodynamics... we took it in high school.

Anyway, this idiot savant is surrounded by extra crispy morons and somehow all the CEO's and execs are deep fried morons too. Talk about no respect whatsoever for anyone. To make matters worse, the comedy is dry, and very "high school." It felt like I was watching an Adam Sandler movie. Mind you, I like some of his movies, but you cant watch too many in succession because it gets old very fast and none of these actors are inherently funny. So overall... dry comedy, bad plots, horrid characters.... not a good show. Pass.

-------WARNING GEEK STUFF FOLLOWS-----------

Lossless compression has not gotten much better in the last 20 years for a reason, the reason is physics. Besides, file size pales in comparison to the speed at which hardware, and network speed increase over time. For instance, a movie file was around 600mb way back in the 90s for a decent rip/encode. Today it is still variable around 600mb to 2gb. But over the same period of time, hard drives have grown 100x fold. Network speed has gone from 56kps to over 10Gbps. Internet backbones are using 100Gb connections and 50+Tbps fiber is already in the works... CPU speed is exponentially faster. Compression is not the problem... fast compression is probably much more important to netflix and youtube than file size. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Bad acting, great special effects, and the story of the Marines in the Pacific Theater could be told by 5th graders and still be fascinating. However, and for whatever reason, the director decided to make the characters so cliche and the writers went waaay out of their way to try to exclude or minimize everything Army, and if that wasn't good enough, decided they needed to throw in a few poorly written jabs as well. Obviously done in poor taste and there's not enough story to hold the narrative together as the characters get lost in the jumble and then sweeping boring lulls. Skip this one, stick to Band of Brothers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The amount of positive reviews for this clunker is staggering. What am I missing here? I get it. McConaughey. Harrelson. Those guys can flat out ACT. But when I'm forced to watch them play out the most arduous script I've ever heard, time to move on. Seriously, every episode is constructed around a diatribe containing exhausting amounts of gravitas and psychobabble. This show takes itself way too seriously. The pacing is annoyingly slow to the point of feeling like it's a chore to get through the first few episodes. The plot is wayward and gets sidetracked by even weaker subplots before ever really establishing ITSELF! No direction. I especially love the lack of character development beyond these two. After half of the first season, I knew nothing of the victim or the killer and moreover, didn't care! I also enjoyed how the director helped me out by slapping a wig on the actors to show me that time had elapsed or jumped back. Thanks! This show is ASININE! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Louisiana, two dysfunctional cops, a fiendish killer,  a psychobabble script….may I suggest that James Lee Burke get a screen credit and a fat royalty.  Speaking of credits, I’m certain there is a production designer, but you can’t tell from watching.  Of course there is a scriptwriter, but unfortunately, the script is as poorly constructed as the wigs that serve as visual time machines, and the dialogue between Cohle and Hart is so poorly conceived it is painful to hear.  I know that I am swimming against the tide of public opinion, but unless this series gets infinitely better, I think you will find that the tide will turn and my review will be the first of many  that will suggest that you meet your need for entertainment elsewhere.  For example, if you are looking for a good mystery, set in Louisiana,  featuring two dysfunctional cops, read a James Lee Burke novel. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This may earn me a bad reputation on here, which it shouldn't, but be that as it may someone has to say this: Although I've sat through the entire season, I still can't get over how laughably sexist the show is. The women of True Detective get three options: You're the extension of the man ("my family" "my wife/ex" "my children"), you're a stripper/prostitute/home-wrecker (for men), or you're dead (because of a man). Well, I suppose if you're lucky you're a really weird backcountry hick or extra or something. I'd really like to see some strong, stand alone females brought to this show. It's entertaining, which earns it a 2, but if True Detective ever hopes to reach Breaking Bad status, it may help to stop alienating your female audience and introduce some more complex female characters. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Slow as a slug this show. I can't believe all these good reviews? What am I missing? I get set up the first for the first few episodes but unless this makes a drastic turn by bye bye!!! Cast means nothing without good writing and plot line. I am so lost with these 2 characters. Their back and forth banter does nothing for me. I'd rather watch paint dry. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I have given this 2 because some of the shooting is very stylish and artistic. Had it not been for that this would have gotten a 1, as it is probably the SLOWEST series I have ever watched.

I am currently 3/4 of the way through the 4th episode, and I'm still waiting for something exciting to happen. The end of episode 3 had some promise,  but we never saw how that panned out. If I survive to the end of the 4th episode I will be surprised, as it really is dull. I cannot understand all the 10 star reviews. If this is your entertainment ideal, then that is your decision. Personally though, I prefer entertainment to be entertaining. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I liked Season 1 a lot. I found it fresh and creative. The characters were invigorating and different from everything else on the tube. Season 2 was OK. I thought the two stars were struggling to come up with more original content and unique situations. Season 3 is just blah! In a number of episodes I thought the lead characters were over the top and just plain stupid. What was funny before is now just dumb and sometimes ignorant. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

this show is not worth typing the 120 minimum words. Let me start of by saying that, this show is incredibly hard to watch due to how unlikeable  all the characters are, starting by hanna. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Over-rated self-conscious self-obsessed show about unsympathetic over-privileged girls. So what's to like? My god, these girls are in the 5% of the world and well into the 1% of the world. Why would anyone care about their whining? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The show is ok. Its a rip off between freaks and geeks and sex and the city.
I do not think this will ever be an International sensation.
It could turn out to be interesting but i am not really that into to go any further.
The lead is annoying. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There seems to be a kind of knee jerk response from critics to many HBO shows: they must be good because they are HBO. Meanwhile, as here, there is a definite disconnect between professional critics and viewers. My bias runs the other way.. Based on history -- The Sopranos, The Wire, Sex and the City, Curb your Enthusiasm, etc. -- I take a more "prove it" stance. I want HBO to prove it still has it. This is the cable network that set the bar after all. "Girls" is simply not up to standards. Watch the first scene again. If this were not HBO, and you hadn't been told by critics and others that it is fantastic, would you watch beyond that scene?

We're welcomed to the show with a run of the mill conversation between an average american brat and its unforgiving parents whom have suddenly decided to cut off life support rendering said brat to throw an inconclusive tantrum from which nothing is resolved, the title screen rolls 'GIRLS' and before any are formally introduced, we already find ourselves disliking them all.A few awkward transitions later we're presented with a failed attempt of affection between two of what appears to be a triad of mentally stunted individuals under a single roof. Two of them deciding upon bathing mutually, likely to cut expenses that were forfeited to purchase a cupcake the more androgynous of the two engulfs while assuring the other that her boyfriend must have a vagina because he's chemically drawn to a **** who confirms to those watching she knows nothing of the opposite sex as she discusses men in an elementary fashion while she walks down the street with her equally confused sidekick.Another awkward conversation follows between the seemingly clueless female and her boss as they discuss the potential of herself being officially hired by the company on a permanent basis, he proceeds to take a dump on the idea of her future opportunity and sends her on her merry way frowning like she just soiled her diaper we begin to feel an ounce of sympathy for the girl and pray to the conclusion that she'll finally get her **** together until we see her dwindle into the arms of a pimply white knight who knows exactly what to say to get her to remove her panties to silence their incompatibility and life confusions leaving a feeling of disgust inside our body as we're left to witness him take advantage of her reproductive orifice.The camera shoots back to her apartment where her roomates are boring each other to death and cracking awkward jokes until ms. haven't a clue walks through the door apparently smelling of so much sex it overpowers the stale stench emitting from all currently known characters until we're treated to a bathroom **** fight between best friend and british newcomer which is just enough to get you half stiff until we find out one girl is already pregnant and ofcourse by accident because none of these girls have what it takes to even take care of a goldfish.So, if you're interested in further speculation of twenty four year olds leeches who act they're four years old. I recommend you stay tuned.

Absolutely ludicrous plot.  A bunch of scenes designed for sensational effect. I. e. the chimpanzee story --shameless exploitation of a tragedy, not even an attempt to fictionalize.
I'd recommend BBC's Luther or Prime Suspect way above this for acting, action, drama, believable multidimensional characters you can care about.
Moss's accent came & went & was awful. Didn't she ever watch Flight of the Conchords to pick up pointers?
Unbelievable critics fell for this horsedoodle and gave it 100--how'd that happen? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I just don't get the appeal of this glacier paced series. Sometmes, when nothing is happening on screen, it doesn't mean that it's deep and thought provoking. It just means that there's nothing happening. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I don't know why, but I have now watched over 20 episodes of this TV-show and just can't laugh about it. I watch HIMYM, Big Bang Theory, Two and a half Men freuguently and love them, but maybe Malcolm in the Middle is just too old for me (2000). Mostly the jokes are embarassing, not funny and things like ripping of your skin like a snake is not funny either. Also I asked more than 10 friends, whether they like it, 'cause it got such good reviews, but not one of them liked it  all in all it is maybe just me  but 2/10 is very gently in my Opinion.

Heroin addiction is a very serious problem in this country,  Mainly because of the war in Afghanistan.  That is the legacy of George Bush;s war.  a country mired in a huge vat of Heroin.  I do not think junkies are people worthy of praise in any way.  They are just ruined junkies. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Clunker of an expositional script plus stodgily "sensitive" direction seemingly designed to appeal to professional focus group goers equals a deadly dull drama. Don't believe the hype about the performances, either. Broadbent's tics will make your head spin, Morton's her usual comatose self and Andy Serkis disastrously endows Ian Brady with something approaching an evil charisma. Don't waste your time on this one if you're looking for complexity. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Vastly overrated show that simply relies on self-deprecation which itself only  belies one of the ugliest forms of egocentrism, not to mention narcissism. By appealing to the lowest common denominators of emotions and memories (onanism, envy, greed etc...) its objective is to give us a false sense of reassurance as in "we are all the same after all, isn't that nice?"
Instead it pulls us down with it...just like abject shows such as "Sex and the city" did before.
Cartmann from South Park summed it up well: "We know that girls are intelligent and funny, so now could you just please repeat your vagina joke?"

I've had it with Sherlock and the pretentious way it presents itself.
It isn't smart.
It isn't funny.
And it's downright insulting to your intelligence.

Where to start?
Everything about the first episode is styled to make you want to like a **** who-apparently-informed everyone in his life except the one man he calls friend. And as the rest of the group never bothered to tell the pained and scarred friend. No. That's melodrama meant to distract you from the fact that the creators never had a way out for the end of season 2.
Then comes the really painful part. Episode 2. That was SO much better written, acted, directed and overall a better production than 1, it was what I expected to see in a Sherlock show. I have nothing but praise for that episode because it's so well done.
Shame episode 3 came along to F0ck that all up.
Episode 3 has good points, characters like Magnussen should have been seen far more in this iteration of Holmes than has been shown. Lars Mikkelsen played the perfect counter to Holmes in this, he was as smart as him-if a little creepier than I'd like-and the type of person who can be a mirror to Holmes, something like 'he's the type of person I would be if not for you, John.'
Shame that the title character is so off base again that I couldn't stand him in a single scene.
Pretentious...totally and utterly pretentious, this isn't a slight against Cumberbatch, he's a terrific actor, but the role and lines in this episode were utterly crap.
And the reveal at the end...well I hate to use too much profanity, but Gatiss and Moffat, you can go away and never touch Sherlock again as far as I'm concerned.
Because that reveal was a load of Donkey Bollocks. And it's just reset the writing to season 1 level now, we'd passed this, it was over with. You'd written yourselves into a position where it would mean the show would end.
LET IT! Not all shows have happy endings, look at The Soprano's for god sake, just as he'd reunited his family after all the **** as his daughter sees him as she's coming in, BAM!
But as this is a staple of the British Broadcasting Company now, as it's raking in a load of money, why not wring as much out of it as possible, eh?
What matter to literary integrity when you can line your pockets?
I'm done, Sherlock is dead to me now, he died as he hit the pavement in season 2, I'm not buying this boxset just for one good episode.
I'm done. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

they really downgraded this show from previous 2 series this time, and lowered the IQ of the show and many audience's as well.

let's just say that i prefer there's no series 3 at all, and Sherlock show should just end at series 2 for good.

although there are still some good acting, music and cinematography at some moments in series 3, but the writing, plots or stories just suck and are not even believable or logical at time, plus character assassination to Sherlock himself (just counting how many times in the episodes you don't believe the things he said, the way he acted or the cold blood killing itself). do we really believe this is THE Sherlock ACD created? really? no, this series showed only a genius detective no more! 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This Boardwalk is no empire. I had great expectations for this series but I found it almost unwatchable. The introduction is so inappropriate it's laughable. The characters are vapid, contrived and poorly cast. The plot development is a boring, muddled mess filled with unconvincing scenarios. Far fetched scenes are exacerbated by unrealistic dialogue while the writers and producers engage in a politically correct tap dance. The whole thing comes off as unauthentic and self indulgent. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The plot moves so slowly that I will have reached old age before anything happens.Classic mistake: young characters look very similar so its impossible to tell who is doing what. Come on ... one of them needs blonde hair, a moustache, earings etc.Sex on every page : yawnConfusing story line, which goes into every detail whether you want it or notBottom line : amazingly boring. It's like watching 1920 style Big Brother 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I watched it with my girlfriend and we really don't understand why this show received good critics. We found it boring and depressing. We prefer by far Games of Thrones, Walking Dead, etc. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I love the plotline.  I love the cast.  However i loathe the extreme sexual content.  Do we really need to see them engaged in 69??  Do we need to see blowjobs???  Sadly i will never watch this show again. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Am I missing something, I watched the first season and wondered what all the hype was about. A couple of psychopaths living together who have no problem killing and manipulating everyone they come into contact with, are we supposed to care what happens to them ? I certainly didn't. Season two more of the same. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Nothing that hasn't been seen before. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Its only funny when the adult Chris is discussing his life as a child. To have to sit through an entire 30 minutes (seems eternal) watching from a childs point of view something so annoying is torture. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

unwatchably bad - is everybody smoking crack? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This show is crap. Barely watchable. I don't understand where the ocean of hype is coming from. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I thought the WIRE was the best TV I'd ever seen - so it was really a shame to end on a low. The final WIRE season was a great disappointment. A number of well-known characters suddenly became two-dimensional and behaved in ways that were totally at odds with how their behaviour had built over previous seasons. New characters were introduced that did not show any depth (unlike in previous seasons, the newsroom crowd did not become real people, compared to say the dock crowd). The plot became unrealistic to the point of farce, and rushed. I wonder how much of this was down to creative exhaustion, and how much of it was down to the reduced series length (in terms of numbers of episodes). Yes, my expectations were very high. But I realise that if I had come to series 5 of the Wire before any of the others, I would have thought it was just another slightly hyper-real gritty cop show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It was the worst season EVER season four was much better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Episode 4 of season 5 qualifies as the worst "Mad Men" episode ever. I give the episode a D. Sally may have been slipped a Seconal but I felt sleepy throughout most of the show.  And Don's hallucinations from a slight fever should have given the story editor nightmares.  Read my full review (what worked/what didnt') here:  www.madmenreview.blogspot.com 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This is one of the most painful collapse of a series I have ever seen. Everything I loved in Mad Men has simply disappeared. It had taken four seasons to build meticulously the psychology of characters such as Betty and Pete, and in a flash all this work was swept away with grotesque and implausible solutions. Betty that becomes obese in a few months is simply meaningless. Pete, who had learned to love his wife, who had built a complicity with her and had become an adult, is now again an **** without interest. Undecided about whether to turn to soap opera or sitcom, Mad Men has lost his artistic identity, as pointed out, moreover, by a direction more and more flat and uninteresting. There remain only the jokes of Roger and the hotness of Megan, and nothing else. I am astounded by the fact that everyone seems to be excited about this series. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Started of really well but now it has got so so rediculous. I was a huge fan of 24, watched every one since it started 4-5 years ago. Now it has got silly, its about time Jack let some of the other characters play the hero with certain scenarios. The story line is rediculous, the bit where half way through the president is involved....come on. Then the issue with the audio file, jack is able to send and duplicate and self destruct any other file but appears to be unable to copy a simple wav/mp3 file when he eventually gets hold of it. I dont think i will be watching any more. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Annoyingly unlikely and poorly constructed a storyline. No idea why this show is popular at all. I'd only watch it when I have absolutely no other program to watch. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

It is an addictive show, there is no doubt about that, but I gotta say that the writing and acting lacks of quality, (with exception of Josh Charles(Will) ,Matt Czuchry(Cary) and Mr.Big( Peter)).
I can see how Julianna Margulies(Alicia) struggles to show any emotion due her plastics surgeries or excessive make up(performance wise is like another kristen stewart). Archie Panjabi(Kalinda)  portrays an awful but miraculous character that saves everyone, every single time, like a female version of James Bond minus the fx of a movie(literally like another character from another universe). I get why people like the show but this show will never reach superior standards and will be forgotten once it is over.
And btw,   I dont really know how they called the show "the good wife". Perhaps just as a mocking terminology??? because it displays completely the opposite of that. In what universe Alicia would be a good wife? It should not have a metacritic that high... I cant understand why this show has better score that breaking bad in some seasons. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I kept hearing great things from my friends and after finally watching it with them I don't understand how anyone enjoys this cheap soap opera... The actors are not very talented (Biggs and the main character are the only competent ones...), the script is convoluted, and it seems like every episode is a bottle episode leading up to nothing... I liked weeds from the same creator but they lost me when they became a soap opera and dropped the entire premise of the show and went to mexico... I think this could be a good show if it had better writing and actors, but even if that happens I won't give it another chance. Also the fact that this is labeled as a comedy is offensive. The fact that this show might win a single emmy is appalling. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Can't stand this show.  It don't get all the buzz from full grown adults about a fairy tale.  It's a bad disney movie with violence.  I keep waiting for Harry Potter to show up.  I've never heard so many bad accents.  Really People??  Where's your taste in good programing? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Silicon Valley is supposed to be a comedy. It's not funny; it's just depressing.
For example: an executive sarcastically suggests the worst idea he can think of. It's objectively bad. The sales team thinks it's great. The CEO thinks it's great. It becomes the company's primary goal. That's the joke.
The whole show is like this now - one man trying to deal with the depressing stupidity of the corporate world from within its constraints. It's not Peter from Office Space knocking down the walls of his cubicle, it's his co-worker pinning a "Hang in there!" poster to the wall. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Enjoyed the first two seasons of this, I liked Betas better and was sorry that got canceled, but this season of SV is complete and utter trash, couldn't make it past the second episode. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I've given up after three episodes. I'm sorry, but it's just crap.

Being an Englishman, my memories of O.J. Simpson's escapades are those revolving around the British media reporting of the time. As such it wasn't a massive 'moment' in history, nor was it really that compelling.

So, for me, watching the show was going to hopefully allow me to understand some of the context surrounding the massive furore that came from O.J.'s acquittal, and shed some light and offer insight into the processes of the Police, the D.A.'s office, the defence attorney etc.

But, what I got instead was a television show which was trying to create a drama...... When everyone watching knows what happens in the end. It didn't make sense. In three episodes I didn't really understand any of the characters' motivations, but the American 'rolling news' sensibility was rammed down my throat.

It's also hard to watch something where 5'8" tall Cuba Gooding Jr, is playing 6'1" O.J. Simpson, surely there were better choices of lead actor available??!!
And hearing David Schwimmer, in his monotone voice, saying 'come on Juice' every 30 seconds in that opening episode had 'internet meme' written all over it!

I guess the appreciation of the show is heavily dependent on whether you're an American or not. Whether you're used to television shows like this, and understand that nation's obsession with fallen 'heroes'.
If you're just someone, like me, looking at this from an outsider's perspective..... It's just terrible television. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

This would be an excellent story: If we didn't know how it ended, who the people were and if it wasn't about O.J. Simpson. Because we now have to reconcile everything we know about OJ in real life with this skewed laughable portrayal of a poor innocent diminutive basketcase. It's not based in fact, it's us sitting inside Simpson's head watching his self made hammed up propaganda film of how HE wants everyone to perceive him. The only way he'd ever act this way is if he were innocent. And we know that's not the case.  His DNA was all over everything. HIS gloves were at both scenes covered in HIS and Nicole's blood. His shoeprints were there, from HIS "ugly ass" shoes that they caught him lying about. HIS car was there near the murder time WITH HIM INSIDE IT. The blood was so well preserved that they could even tell he'd been to McDonald's recently because they found a preservative used in McDonald's Big Mac Special sauce that had come off of his hands and mixed into the blood while he was killing his victims. The worst thing about it is that OJ isn't portrayed in this. Where's OJ. It's been 22 years. After everything that has happened during that time, OJ's real personality is in sharp focus. He is a cool, calm, collected, strategic, manipulator. He cares only about himself. He would never consider killing himself, period. When his world doesn't conform to his will he strikes back swiftly and precisely with no remorse. Time and time again he himself has demonstrated this to be true. However, here they have him as a hot-headed peabrained basket case who readily winds himself up and then breaks down and wants to die. It's like they put Michael Richards in The body of someone who almost passes for OJ. This is not the way to tell America's most influential prosecution story. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I'm a big fan of the voice actors in this series, so I really wanted to enjoy the show.
The main character is just so unlikeable, (reminds me of Jason Alexander's cartoon in the late 90's, Duckman, another talking animal show with uninteresting characters.) After watching several episodes, I felt there wasn't any funny moments and each episodes seems to drag . . .

It just seems to be lacking something, but I'm not interested in the series enough to invest any more time to find out. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I really don't get it. Where is the art? It tries to be so naturalistic that it feels forced.
It feels as I'm just following the life of a rather unimportant man with an unimportant life and unimportant people who care about being important. Navel-gazing at its worst or, in other words, the Facebook Twitter generation and its dearth of imagination. D. Glover is cute and makes a few jokes but I really want to slap him across the face. Don't you? 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

There are similarities between The Night Of's premise and the Andan Sayed case made so popular on the podcast Serial but the tv series is not anywhere near as gripping.  The first episode had a number of holes but I soldiered on, binge watching the entire series wondering what I was missing since this show rated so highly on Metacritic but I was so so sorely disappointed. The cat, the eczema, the inappropriate and unnecessary sexual exploits, the sloppy rendering of police and judicial procedure, the melodramatic pacing, and the one dimensional characters made even the great John Turturro's acting woefully inadequate to bring this drama 'justice'.  There is no rhyme or reason why this badly written script should have been permitted to go to film.  Do not waste your time hoping it gets better. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you like or miss soap operas this is a good choice, it is well written, acted and the characters are likable or even lovable. But I don't like soap operas 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Could someone please explain what's really funny in this show? I loved Ansari in Parks & Recreation but what the hell is this?! I can't see a single funny joke or szene within the first 16 minutes of the pilot, so I have no other chance to quit this series with disappointment. That's no sitcom, you can probably call it a social study by an obviously way overrated US standup comedian. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Miguelit0's review said it all for me.
The show is ham-handed, with poor writing and acting.
As a liberal I'm offended at how dumb-liberal the show constantly is.
It's at about a 10th grade level of sophistication, in every way. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I do appreciate the effort, diversity and issues tackled in the show, I really had high expectations and thought that  "The magically hilarious" show is finally here. However I can only remember myself laughing (smiling is a better word) once or twice during the whole season. I found it really childish and boring, and it kept getting worse. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Aziz Ansari is very good stand up comic, but this show is just boring. Stick to live shows man, you are good in live performances. My score is just for the effort of making this show. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The violence and the sex of the final episode were desperation compensating for a storyline, Anyone can write that stuff. Unworthy of a big budget and a previously great production. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

All-shocking and no faithful to the book. Congratulations HBO, you guys just ruined the show. It was so hard to see the whole season. Why burn a girl on a fire if it wasn't on the book? I think HBO forgot how to do good shows 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As a reader of the books, this season was an absolute disaster to me. It helped me realize that the show will spoil the books in a way that is extremely POORLY written. The saddest thing is that even if I don't watch the show any more I won't be able to escape the spoilers. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

In the fifth season it feels like it's more of a fan fiction rather than a show that is based on the books.

I have to say it: Game of Thrones is a Miley Cyrus of TV shows. When the amount of viewers drop it either does something shocking like killing some of the main characters or shows us more boobs Killing off characters got more and more boring with time so they went one step further and started murdering characters that live in the books.

Well, I give it 2 points for the boobs Right now they are the best thing about this show and some of the chicks are really beautiful. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

As much as I love Louis CK the comedian and that I really like Louie season 1-3 I had some trouble with season 5.

All the humanist, humorous, mildly self deprecating side of Louis CK that was central to the show has been replaced by something much darker. There is so much misery and self hatred that the character and situations are hardly relatable.

I don't think that's a conscious artistic decision either: the season has been produced on a significantly tighter timescale than the previous ones, and there's definitely a feeling that the show has been hurriedly put together, with a lot of sloppy writing and poor acting - seriously Pamela Aldon is awful, just remove her once and for all.

I score this season 2/10 because here and there you may have a chuckle, but overall it's abysmal :( 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I can only assume that the positive reviews for this show were written after viewing only the first one or two episodes. Anyone who watches beyond that will be bombarded with incomprehensible plotlines that come to nothing.  The overwhelming impression is of a scriptwriter that has a good concept and then totally loses control of the story.  None of this makes any sense. There are no startling revelations that bring things together.  It's just a shambles.  The fact that it's French doesn't make it any less of a shambles.  Seriously, don't bother watching this unless you want to remind yourself just how wrong TV critics can be. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

No substance, just some glossy production values.
I read a few critic reviews, and can only assume that they had only watched the first episode before they wrote the reviews.
The series does not build any likeability for any of the characters, does not provide any answers, or even implied possibilities for what is happening and why.
Wasted a few evenings of my precious small life that is hopefully not coming back in that awfully boring french village. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first seven episodes really test the patience, looks like the story won't lead anywhere and the character's reactions to events doesn't seems reasonable. After you start to understand the characters and the mystery rises nothing really adds up and nothing resolves. Won't wait for season 2. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Satin and Showtime's Shameless had a baby and Transparent was born
It is disturbing that this show is top rated this shows the audience lacks morality and is no longer capable to discern wrong and right. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

I for one am always up for a good sex scene or two, but this show is bordering on the absurd.  It should be called Transporno.  If you like watching ugly people having sex with good looking people ALL the time (yeah, that's realistic)...then this is the show for you.  The children are depicted as selfish and extremely unlikeable, which is clearly intentional.  In the end you wind up cringing whenever a new character is introduced, because inevitably one of them wind up (as the butch so poignantly states) "fcking your brains out".   Extremely tedious.   However, all that being said, Jeffrey Tambor and Judith Light are terrific.  It would have been a much better show if it just focused on them.

Oh my gosh, why did I let myself get sucked into this program! I agree that it's not as "24" as one might expect from the title or commercials, but that's only because NOTHING EVER HAPPENS! It's not because this show is realistic or anything. There are still seriously preposterous plot lines going on here, they just travel in circles and dead ends with no payout for the viewer. This is not high art - you aren't going to learn anything about human existence from this show. It's just a series of dramatic episodes with a whole lot of climax and no resolution. The season finale was the biggest disappointment of all. That said, Claire Danes is a fantastic actress. It's worth watching an episode just to see that quality of acting on television, but don't let yourself get sucked into the plot, hoping for any conclusion. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

So, I hear that this little show is critically acclaimed--Wow, I think. It's won an Emmy AND a Golden Globe for best drama series, during it's FIRST season! So, I think--this show is a MUST see. Well, over the course of 4 days, I plow through all 12 episodes of the first season, and I NEVER want to revisit this show again. The storytelling was slow and sloppy to the point at which it never really hooked me--and I seriously look for these things in a TV show. There's no real plausibility in what happens throughout the show. I find it very difficult to believe that people love this show and would award it over what Breaking Bad did in the 4th season. I just don't get it. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Holy   terrible show, seriously, it's BAD, the story tries to be complex, but it's  stupid. This show takes itself way too seriously, I'd rather watch 24, at least that show had a stupid plot, but it didn't take itself too seriously...
I don't get this show, I really don't..... 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Homeland is just bad.A CIA agent convinced that a man is a terrorist without any proof convinces another CIA agent with the most stupid thing ever seen. If you're a patriotic american that's your show. If you're a person looking for a good show then you'll dislike this. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Very disappointing. Some of the acting, many of the characters and most of the plot lack believability. Worst of all though, episode after episode goes by without much of import happening, and the shows end up committing the cardinal sin of being boring. Claire Danes and Damian Lewis do find their moments to shine though. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

If you are able to suspend belief that a blonde girl can walk around Baghdad, sorry, a CIA intelligence blonde girl , in the midst of the insurgency, then, this is the movie for you. If you are a fan of Breaking Bad where each detail is intricately woven then you will be disappointed . This is an American show for an American audience. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Total rubbish. The first two series (or 'seasons') of The Americans were like a gripping, intense thriller with a soupçon of complicated romance in there; fantastic stuff. The latest offering is mind-numbingly dull; the plots seem to be going absolutely nowhere, there is no intensity or suspense anymore, all Philip and Elisabeth do is bicker about parenting and Stan skulks around looking like a lost iguana. So disappointing after such a great start. I only watch it now if I've absolutely nothing better to do. Where's the action? Where's the cohesion in  the plot development? It's become like a bad 870s soap opera. DULL. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

The first 2 seasons of the Louis show were brilliant comedy. Season 3 started the mixed bag and season 4 isn't even a comedy.  There are no laughs, just sad sack darkness with no direction.  It's almost like Louis is seeing how unfunny he can get before the network pulls the plug. If Season 4 was his first season nobody would have watched. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Hmmm. Seems like I may be in a minority here. Rather than write a waffling review, I'll simply suggest some alternative titles for the show: 1. Battlestar Cliche (the writers use every tired soap opera, science fiction mechanism invented) 2. Battlestar LongHardStare (as practiced by all the chracters at each other every 8 minutes, or so - hey, it's cheaper than special effects and compelling storyline) 3. Battlestar GodNonsense (I was expecting to see Ted Haggard in the script writer credits) 4. Battlestar HammyActing ("ooh, it's my turn for the camera - watch me ACT!") 5. Battlestar WhoopinAndHollerin ("Any time there's a celebration amongst the pilot jocks I half expect them to start chanting "USA! USA! USA!") 6. Battlestar GenderEquality (It's amazing how often women beat up much larger men I could go on, but you get the idea. 
-;-;-;-;-;-;-

Sorry, but the new Battlestar Galactica series just seems way too overwrought and tedious to me. Sort of like watching Edward James Olmos doing "Days of Our Lives - in Outer Space". Or maybe like the 'soaps', the over-acting is the whole attraction. But hey, it's just TV and if it floats your boat, fine. What I'm curious about is why this series seems to attract the kind of fans who have such a spooky, almost religious fervor, and seem especially touchy about any kind of criticism from "unbelievers"? Or perhaps it's simply what happens when you watch too much over-dramatized, forced paranoia every week.

OMG, this show sucks! Who wants to watch this bag full of crazy we call woman? The script is utter hippie-dippie tripe. Enlightened? No. I could feel the IQ points being sucked out of me as the hour ticked away. Men, don't let your ladies talk you into this one. They slobber over the show because of a woman they can relate to and they'll want you to relate too. Yeah, right.  Dern is good as the neurotic schizoid torn between her true self (read lunatic woman) and the enlightened zen-master hippie she professes to be. But the years haven't been kind to Ms. Dern. Don't be a sack-less eunuch. Turn the channel to Game of Thrones or Walking Dead instead.
PS Proof, once again, that the critics will praise any garbage about an empowered woman.

Oh my dear Jesus. To do such a thing to a decent series. It was like watching a horse with a broken leg try to walk, but the man with the shotgun takes 20 episodes to finally put it out of its misery. I damn you David Chase. The stories sounded like they were written by a bunch of 16 year old girls while the dialog sounded closer to five monkeys on four typewriters. Just ouch.

Not half as good as the past seasons. Was NOT worth the wait

I must be missing something. To me this is, and has always been a long drawn-out soap opera with a little bit of violence added to relieve the boredom.

Dream sequences??? That's been around since tv began. It's jumped the shark. I loved this show and I have been bored to death with these 2 episodes. The acting is out of control. I love Edie Falco - Oz, etc. But she is terrible in this b/c it's so worn out to begin with. the realtionships between normal life and crime, family anf friend ties - all that is now a saccharine sob fest about poor Tony.

I don't get the love for this show. Yeah, it's well made and well acted, but everything about it is forced and not really edge-of-seat dramatic for me.

As long as it has OJ's name on it; I guess it gets a high review no matter what. Honestly, this really isn't worth looking into if you are familiar at all with this tiresome and frivolous case.

This is a shockingly overrated series. The plot is utterly, ridiculously beyond any shadow of credibility, with the shifts in character loyalties and incessant hints at hidden agendas a never-ending bore, and an absolutely hilarious, shockingly shallow take on the secret-service and analyst work (and I am saying this as one who, apparently, happens to know a lot more about it than the screenwriters). I should conclude that not in this world, nor in any alternative universe, would a whack-job such as the Claire Danes character pass the tests and clearances to land a secret service field job (this has nothing to do with the actress being horribly miscast, rather with how the part is written), and that on any sane planet, this show would be dropped by the audiences after Season 1 at the latest. I was hoping it would improve with time, or that the critics were right this time, but had to drop it after four episodes as a complete waste of time.

Just watched the whole season and have to say booooo.  The majority of the 12 episodes is about the teenage daughter that whines and complains.  Dont understand why the writers made this 13 year old such a part of this particular season. And a brain tarted cia agent is just ridicolous script writing Proves that only the great shows have great second seasons.  Anyone can write and make a great first season because you have all the time in the world but a second season has to be made in 12 months, its a stress test for the show writers/creators and they are no good and blew it as shown in this season. Come on people, if you think this is 96/100 television you are bored and easily impressed.  I loved season one but this one was hard for me to complete with all the other shows and movies being released.  But for this particular show and season to score 96/100 blows my mind.  NO GOOD

There are not many shows where the dialogue between actors is creative and thoughtful

This is one of those shows, Incredible acting . I will truly miss all of these characters,even Trey!

I really enjoyed the show up til this season and was looking forward to seeing it come to a close. This season was sooooooo boring. I did not care about the mom letting go, her visits to see Daniel, his little brother selling crap, Tawney's patient's death, the Teds' father-son relationship, the selling of the stupid tire store,  Daniel's roomates, Daniel's new girlfriend, and a few other things I am sure. The ending where the DA pretty much admitted on TV that Daniel was probably innocent was tearful. Even all the talking about the failed initial investigation got old. I just didn't feel this season even for a slow burn show like this.
