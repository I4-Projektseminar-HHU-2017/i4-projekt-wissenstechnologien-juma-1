The dungeons are interesting and unique, the characters are interesting and have personality, the story is highly engaging, the combat is varied, fluid, and fun, the items are amazing, there are a plethora of interesting side quests and collectibles, and considering the fact that this game was made in 1998 the graphics are amazing. The only real downside is that the game is somewhat linear and you can't continue on after beating the final boss, but that doesn't detract from the huge amount of fun I had playing this game. This has to be one of if not the best games ever made just as the others have said.", "points": 10}, {"text": "I'm one of those people who think that this is the greatest game of all time, no matter what quality games are out now or will be out ever. This is just plain the best game I've ever played. Why? Partly because it was the first good game I've actually played. When I first got a Nintendo 64 I was considerably young, and yet every game I played I thought was absolutely horrible. All I had were simple objective games, and as a child I thought they were hard and pointless. Then one day Ocarina of Time was brought home and I at first refused to play it. So I watched my father play it for a while, and straight away it was something entirely new and different. Also at the time, it was the most real (to me at least). What brought me in was the ability to actually explore and get to know people, even if the people you talked to all repeated the same things over and over no matter how many times you talked to them, but it didn't matter. This game was something new and exciting to me, and to this day I get this good old nostalgic feeling whenever I play it. It has one of the greatest stories of all time for a video game and was one of the first to create its own sort of universe and it was one of the first 3D environment game where you can see in all 360 degrees (after Mario 64 that is). Plus to this day people are still discovering new secrets to the game and so many in-depth theories arise from this title alone based upon this game that keep it interesting. The characters feel like characters and the visuals are some of the most cinematic of its time. The gameplay is also very fun, which of course is one of the most important things and there are very involving puzzles that are simple enough in appears but very complex when you get down to it. There is so much that I could say about this game, but sometimes even looking back, I'm at a loss of words at how awesome this game is.", "points": 10}, {"text": "This game is the highest rated game on Metacritic and for good reasons. It takes elements from every other game that existed before it and multiplied it several times over. Almost 12 years later, I can play Ocarina of Time and STILL see things that it does, that games of this 2010 decade cannot d. It stands the test of time and will forever be in my heart as the greatest game of all time ever in the world. Many games have tried to conquer that title. All have failed. I'm more than happy to say that.", "points": 10}, {"text": "I think it's funny that you have Zelda haters writing reviews based on their personal feelings towards the game, as opposed to how the game play actually was for them. Ocarina of Time was one of the single greatest games ever created. It set a precedence for future games. The graphics were unrivaled at the time, the game actually took real skill to beat it at times. In other words, it wasn't something that you would pick up, beat in an hour, and never look at again. I can still pick this game up, and still play through it while enjoying every single second of it.", "points": 10}, {"text": "I played A Link To The Past so many times in my childhood i lost count. When i got OoT for Christmas it was BYE BYE childhood! This game is the very definition of epic, i loved every second of it!", "points": 9}, {"text": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is without a doubt one of the greatest video games of all time. To say that this game was great is an understatement. Ocarina introduced the gaming world to the aspect of open world play with a wonderfully sized map that was large and full of exploration but not in the slightest bit unnecessary. The level and dungeon design was the best of it's time and in still to this day remains one of most brilliant, beautiful, and interesting worlds of any video game on the market. Every area you explore from the moment you wake up in the lush and green forest of the Kokiri to the vast and deep desert of the Gerudos' is crafted to perfection. The combat system in Ocarina was also a shining star. Not only did weapons feel right, react well, and play out perfectly, but they were always interesting and had their own advantages. Not once did a weapon outshine another because they all had a great purpose. The Z-Targeting system was added for a more cinematic feel that worked flawlessly and it even made combat easier and more interesting. The music and sounds of the game brought it to life as well. Every area had it's own theme music that was unique to that zone and always felt right and gave the player that more personal feeling wherever he/she went. Kokiri Forest felt like a wonderful place of happiness while Hyrule Field had an epic and powerful tone to it. The addition of musical gameplay made things more interesting as well and showed an importance to every area the player visited. Now, most importantly to the Zelda series itself and to any video game for that matter, comes the story. The Legend of Zelda has always been a series shining in the glory of it's adventures and this was the biggest and most powerful of them all. You begin as a young boy who has always felt left out and who has nightmares of dark visions that would become realities. As you start your quest you realize your true destiny and embark on a journey filled with adventure and courage like no other. The dark king of the Gerudo's Gannondorf seeks the legendary Triforce and will stop at nothing to rule the land of Hyrule. By unleashing monsters from the Temples' of Hyrule and by turning the once good and just land to pure evil, Gannondorf attempts total rule over the world. Link being the Hero of Hyrule must journey to the different lands and temples' of the land in order to gain power from the mystical \"sages\" and stop Gannondorf. The story in Ocarina beings great and never lets go. In fact the game gets better every second that it progresses. You meet many interesting characters such as Princess Ruto, Malon, Darunia, and the mysterious Sheik that not only have their own individual traits, but also contain important roles in your quest. Also, each character is easily remembered and full of emotion which grasps the player and gives them a sense of caring and passion for each one. The many temples and dungeons visited during the game are all fun, unique, and interesting and reward the player as he/she progresses. The game has quite a few side quests that are entertaining and it follows through right up to the end. There is nothing negative about this game and to this day it stands on a pedestal as one of if not the greatest game of all time and for good reason. Since it's release very few games have captured the true story, art, and power Ocarina of Time had mastered back in 1998. To this day I myself still play it and still consider it my favorite game ever. Not because of great graphics, or online play, or anything else that current games have fallen into but because Zelda is a game that touched my heart like no other game ever has. Current game developers and enthusiasts need to look back at The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and reconsider the direction that games are going. Zelda mastered it, and for that we should honor it.", "points": 10}, {"text": "This game is do doubt the greatest game in existance. Non, except for Nintendo haters, have been able to play this game without admiting it is at least one of the best of the best, if not THE best of the best. Super Mario 64 was the first game to make 3D conversion work, but this was the game that perfected it. It introduced a large 3 dimensional world to explore, which at the time was a huge deal. It also introduced new gameplay mechanics that made the action adventure genre work out even more. Like the lock-on targeting system, which helped to keep your eye on the enemy much easier, but without making the fighting too easy, as you had to meneuver around the enemy and dodge his attacks. Another big new feature was horse-back riding. Riding your horse around the huge field was big and new. It had an engaging story, that really sucked you in, which had lots of twists and turns. Like when Ganondorf attacked the castle, destroying your plan to get the Triforce before Ganon did. Or near the end, when Shiek, the man who helped you on your journey as an adult, reveals himself to be Princess Zelda, the person Link had been searching long and hard for. Another thing was the conversion from Young Link to Adult Link. This was the first Zelda game that introduced Adult Link, making him look more epic, and more like the hero of the legends. But the bigger twist is how you can play as both Young Link and Adult Link. Not only that, but the story counts on you using both of them to make it all the way through the story. There are alot of complicated dungeons with puzzles to solve, which can sometime twist your brain, and make the game much more challenging. What I loved about Zelda was the flawless gameplay and beautiful landscapes. Zelda Ocarina of Time was a first, it brought forth the perfection of 3D conversion, and made it beautiful, but also made the 3D mechanics work with how the game played out, and it worked beautifully. Of course the game isn't perfect, there are a few flaws in Ocarina of Time. Like the Water Temple, which is the most unpopular dungeon in the game. Everyone had a hard time with it, so it proved to be a bit too challenging. Plus in some parts of the game, the graphics don't look good at all. However, these flaws are not severe enough to interfere with the games overall greatness. There may be no such thing as a perfect game, but this game is as close to a perfect game as you can get. Zelda Ocarina of Time won Game of the Year in 1998, and got an honorable award in outstanding gaming achievement in 1999, and it didn't win these awards without good reason. This game is truley the best game of all time, and anyone who thinks they can make a game better than this is absolutely crazy. Sure Ocarina of Time may not be outstanding by todays standards, but considering the technology of gaming at the time, it was the best gaming could offer. Even 13 years after the game came out, Ocarina of Time is still selling like nuts via the Wii Virtual Console, which re-released Ocarina of Time in 2007. In my opinion, Ocarina of Time is, and will always be, the greatest game ever made, and I'm not alone in that statement. I have yet to meet a person who is not a Zelda hater who played Ocarina of Time and thought the games was horrible.

If you wanted to compress that large of a game, with the music, dungeons, all of the sidequests, the main storyline, and everything else in that small space, you get this game. It's incredible they fit it into that size. Of course, the game still has it's downsides, but minor, as that the major complaint is the storyline.

This may seem like it would make Ocarina of Time a snap, but there is still a great difficulty level. The graphics aren't up to par with today's standards but they aren't bad at all as the graphics were ahead of their time. One of the best things about the Ocarina of Time is the story. It seems simple and to the point, but it is riddled with plot twists that keep you coming back for more. One aspect of video games that many overlook is the music. Ocarina of Time has one of the best game soundtracks I have ever heard. And the variety of music styles is amazing! There aren't just one or two great tracks, every soundtrack is unique and great.Overall, this is the best game I have ever played.", "points": 10}, {"text": "Now I never give a game a perfect score... But I simply cannot give Ocarina of Time anything lower then a 10. This game is on a level of its own. Perhaps the best game to come out on a Nintendo System, this game raised the bar for 3D gaming and still stands at the top.  When OoT came out I immediately begged my parents for this game. Nintendo power raved about this game, and every person I knew with a Nintendo 64 owned it. Once I got a hold of this game I sat in front of my television for weeks until I beat everything this bad boy offered. 13+ years later and I still re-beat this game at least once a year. Any person willing to call themselves a gamer HAS to play this game. From a designer perspective this game was about 10 years ahead of its time in terms of quality gameplay. For those of us old enough to remember video games prior to current and last gen consoles, we all remember the classic side scrollers and there leap to 3D. Unfortunately, most of those series died with the jump to 3-D. Zelda, on the other hand, took that leap and then some with Ocarina of Time. The game is just that good.\n\nFor those of you who never played a Zelda game before, the Zelda series is composed of Action/Adventure games that put the gamer in a fantasy world known as Hyrule. The gamer always plays as the protagonist, Link, and is almost always sent on a task of rescuing the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the Dark Lord Ganon. Ocarina of Time is no different. The entire story in a nut shell is the \"fairy boy\" Link is sent on a quest to save Hyrule from the clutches of Ganon. During your adventure you must dwell thru 8-9 dungeons, slay massive bosses, and save Princess Zelda. You can expect a great story and about 30 hours of gameplay for your first playthrough. Obvious, those of you wishing to 100% the game will probably need to spend well over 30 hours to complete the entire game without the use of a guide. Moving forward, the gameplay is the \"bread and butter\" of the series. In Ocarina of Time you can expect to tackle hundreds of puzzles, slay tons monsters, obtain dozens of items, and complete many minigames during your adventure. The combat system really shines in this game with the use of \"Z-Targeting.\" Z-targeting basically allows the players to lock onto a monster or item with a simple tap of the Z button. This allows the player to stay focused on the enemy they want to be fighting (this was also one of the first games to introduce such a feature). The general idea of Ocarina of Time is to find and complete 8 dungeons before confronting Ganon in a final battle. These dungeons are big and packed with puzzles that test the players skill and knowledge. Each dungeon requires the player to find a certain item and boss key before battling the dungeon's final boss. On top of these dungeons, OoT has a massive overworld where the player can interact with citizens of Hyrule, play minigames, hunt for heart pieces and treasure, or just explore the terrain. As I mentioned before this was a massive game for its time. Most players will spend 30-50 hours completing this game.\n\nFinally, the Zelda series is probably most known for its music. OoT continues not to disappoint us and delivers dozens of memorial tunes. From the overworld theme to the magical songs you unlock to help Link in his quest, the music leaves no disappointment. Even 14 years after this game came out, these songs still sound beautiful. Lets just say this game alone made the sales of Ocarina musical instruments soar. There is no words to describe how much I love this game. I'm a typical gamer that enjoys the big shooters that most people play today (CoD, Halo, Gears of War, etc...) Even though I have literally days-weeks of playing time on those games, I still do not consider them anywhere near Zelda; Especially Ocarina of Time. As I said before, I still go back to beat this game at least once a year. The game has aged extremely well and is still a blast to play. Although the graphics and technology may be old, Ocarina of Time still remains the highest scored game by critics world wide. Do yourselves a favor and buy this game for N64, Gamecube, Wii-Virtual Console, or 3DS. Its well worth the $10-30.\n\nGraphics 10/10 (for its time)\nSound 10/10\nGameplay 10/10\nRe-playability 10/10", "points": 10}, {"text": "Definitely greatest game on the N64, and the best game ever created. Ocarina of Time gave us revolutionary 3D gameplay and an epic story not to mention one of the nicest looking games on the N64. The game design is truly second to none. You'll be exploring dungeons set in a desert, underwater, in a haunted mansion, in a graveyard and other interesting locales. Although the water dungeon can be infuriating if you miss a small key, the concept of having access to different rooms with different water elevations is genius.  Although the music is in MIDI format, it was a staple in 1998, and the scores are amazing anyway! So many memorable tunes and epic pieces in this game!\n\nIf I'd mention the story once more, it's that it is an amazing coming of age story. Link as a child is not taken seriously by anyone and is even one shotted by Ganondorf before the time leap. (Also, this is the best incarnation of Ganondorf in a Zelda game in my opinion, as he antagonizes you throughout the game, and it becomes the players desire to finally put him in his place.... not to mention he screws all of Hyrule over after 7 years have passed!! The first time I saw that he followed you into the sacred realm was actually awe inducing. There I was expecting myself to continue on my journey with this sick sword and BAM there comes Ganondorfs theme and im like wtf!). Link then ages 7 years and has to find 6 sages before the showdown with Ganondorf with a totally warped Hyrule. They nailed the story in this game, And for people in 1998, it probably blew their minds. (especially with that Sheik reveal near the end). Honestly, I could go on and on about this game (also the final boss is my favorite final boss in gaming) but I'll stop here.\n\nOne of the most deserving games of a 10/10 ever.", "points": 10}, {"text": "It's a masterpiece.

Difficulty is flawed when it's due to bad design - example being  a game like Binding of Isaac where you can go through dungeons with tons of locked doors and chest but not one god damn key included in the entire stage - that's difficulty through bad design rather than difficulty by intention.

The game flourishes in a brilliant Open-world setting, as we gamers agree, the best type of game there is (Grand Theft Auto and LA Noire are examples of Open World Games). Brilliant gameplay, especially being the first 3D Zelda game in which all others based off of, and I think people can have continuous fun hours on end just messing around with the Ocarina lol.", "points": 10}, {"text": "This game is really perfection.

Anyone who is giving this negative results go back to your generic shooter x franchise. This game really is the godfather, the dark knight, or lord of the rings of the game world.I don't like the godfather, but would still rate it nearly perfect as it is just so well made and executed, just like this game. It feels like everything in the game has been thought about, perfect pacing, exquisite level design, intriguing story, and just that x factor any perfect form of media has without the need for modern day effects or graphics.This shows if a game, film, book or album can be just as good now than.it was when released even if visually it might be dated.By the way this comes from some who does appreciate modern day visuals and owns a top end pc which maxes any title thrown at it.", "points": 10}, {"text": "So many of this games negative reviews are about poor graphics or boring gameplay, which is a problem because they're reviewing this game through the eyes of today, which is impossible to do so seeing as it was released in 1998. This game is THE blueprint, not on for Zelda games but any Zelda-inspired game since. The reasons this game is cited as \"The Best Game of All Time\" are many, all of which are accurate. It was really the first game evr to break through what is known as the \"polygon ceiling\". Franchises just couldn't make the jump to 3D correctly, either failing miserably like Bubsy or having to sacrifice something to make the grade meaning those games lost exactly what made the series good (Castlevania is the one that springs to mind here). OoT, however, not only showed everyone how 3D should be done, but how games should be done in general by having a great, fun story with plenty of twists and turns along the way, great controls that were simple to pick up and play and a massive amount of innovations with Z-Targeting being the most prevalent. Enjoyiing that lock-on in any game ever? You have Ocarina to thank for that. The puzzles were brilliant because they showcased the 3D perfectly, making you have to utilise spacial awareness by, for example, standing at a vantage point to fire an arrow through a lit torch so it sets on fire and ignites an extinguished torch at the other end of the room. No 3D game did that, which is why it was the pinnacle of the new revolution. The game is enormous even today, with in-depth side-quests that can easily detract you from the story for hours. Puzzles aren't out of reach for anyone so you don't have to be a genius to carry on with the story. Yes, sometimes the puzzles are more of the same, but that is really all they could do at the time with technology and memory constraints. This game was so big, a GamePak with increased memory was made just for this game, that later on became the standard memory allowance. The music is instantly recognisable and most of the well-known Zelda tracks are from this game, the only main song missing is the Zelda theme at the start instead opting for original music which, while an excellent piece is a little disappointing. Even after a decade, it's still the highest scored game ever on this site and there is a reason for that. This is not just a great Zelda game, but the greatest game of all time.

Characters are so well-made they stick with you and feel alive even long after you played through once again. Graphically it's still really pleasing, because the aesthetics are so good. Pretty famous for it's story that keeps you involved at all times, never getting less climactic and leading to a huge pay-off and closure. Dungeon and level design is top notch and so clever they can be learned from even now. So much excellent extra content in exploring, secrets, mini-games and collectables that actually matter and improve your character and enhance the gameplay and is fun to do. Combat has alot of puzzle elements imbedded as well, especially the bosses require finding a solution whilst in the heat of the battle. It's all controlled rather intuitive with the Z-targetting being used for the first time and the handy hotkey buttons for sidegrade  weapons and items. The HUD was also non intrusive and nicely designed for the time. Navigating through the expansive open world and dungeon is made user friendly by the clear map system, has no problems with mulitple floors and levels. The array of gadgets and weapons to your disposal is astounding and let's you find several ways to reach your goal.

I was sneaking around a large Military base in my favourite series  \"Metal Gear Solid\" and capping zombies left, right and center in \"Resident Evil 2\", whilst happily stopping Gruntilda in \"Banjo Kazooie\" and getting lost in paintings in the superb \"Super Mario 64\".\n\nAs soon as you load up this Game, The Introduction will NEVER leave your memory, Koji Kondo's Introductory music will attach itself to your brain and along with the cinematic of a young adult riding his horse through the vast Hyrule field sums up everything you need to know that this is going to be quite the Adventure.\n\nThe story involves a young boy living in the woods with other equally aged kids, who is summoned by the  forest deity \"The Great Deku Tree\" who sends the boy named \"Link\" and his new Companion \"Navi\" the fairy on a Journey to save the Land of Hyrule and it's Princess \"Zelda\" from the Evil tyrant \"Ganondorf\".\n\nAnd from there on an Epic tale that spans several years begins, interacting with the many citizens and species of the lands, revisiting them years later to see how their domains have stood the test of time, and of course dungeons and puzzles all expertly crafted around fantastic tools you'll discover and ultimately need to take down some of gaming's most memorable foes.\n\nAgain just writing this down you KNOW this game is Legend, obviously take note that I had not played the superb games in the series beforehand, and this was my introduction to superbly crafted 3-D gaming space suddenly do you realize just how much Ocarina of Time, has raised the bar, set the standard and still to this day is the pinnacle of Adventure Gaming.\n\nI have to say that I never really had problems with the controls (I heard many people found them clustered), I will admit, I tend to rate things on how well they will stand the test of time, On an unrelated topic \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" is my favourite movie as I've seen it countless times and never tire or find boredom in any part of it's running time, that's also this game, not once do I have any bitterness towards any part, I guess on repeated playthroughs did I realize that I couldn't wait to play the 2nd Act of this game where the abundance of development really soaks in.\n\nReceiving more Items, Learning Ocarina melodies, Dungeon and Cave exploration (I really find myself wanting to play it again right now). It remains just as relevant now as it did 15 years ago...\n\nFinal Verdict: I better end here because in all honesty I could go on forever, it needs to be played to be believed, and I hope anyone reading this \"got\" how much this game means the way I felt about it years ago and even today.

The graphics are extremely badly aged due them being low res and bitmap (vector graphics age better, which is why even A Link to the Past looks better better due to its simplistic flat colored 2D).

This, however, has no correlation with its quality; I simply mean to make the fact apparent that some 10/10 reviews, well, shouldn't be as inflated as they are despite the amazing quality of this game. And anyone saying that \"people voting 8's or 7's are idiots\" are really nothing more than just stubborn giga-fans. That being said, my critique is as follows:\n\nThere's no denial that this game is a great experience for apt Zelda fans. It presents a wonderful, new environment to the player, an arguably mega-fluid combat system, a light, yet invest-worthy engine, and most of all, a mood-setter that can be matched by few other games. Immersion is in near totality, with its only shortcomings being the limitations of the time. There's little that can be said against the game.\n\nHowever, there is in fact, even in this masterpiece, room for some error:\nThe main problem in the game, though not overwhelmingly prominent, is the slight feeling of emptiness associated with plot-carrying. If you choose to look at it standalone, there is a present problem in the fact that the game never truly reaches the point that you feel the overwhelming need to \"push on\" towards the end-result (which I'll not spoil). You feel, rather than working with Link to reach a goal, that you're watching the story play out for you. The problem with deciding the factoring of this error into a numeric review is the fact that the fault of this is halfway between the creators themselves, but also the simple limitations of the time. The only thing that's stopping me from giving this a full 10/10 is the likely possibility that this error could have been fixed, or at least improved with more consideration into immersion, no matter the era. And to be fair, a 10/10 implies a perfect game. Meaning there would be NO POSSIBILITY for ANY improvement in the game, which this game barely falls short of.\n\nThere's not much more to say. This is, arguably, one of the greatest games ever made, and is near-perfect aside from it's minor immersion flaw. But I'd recommend this game to anyone in a heartbeat.

When this game came out in 98 people where mind blown. It was one of the games in history that changed gaming. This game has aged well, Many people who are new gamers who are used to graphics and dramatic scenes may not like it as much because its old but will still enjoy it so much. This game has great music, characters, terrain, and probably the best development of any video game. Link the hero of time starts off as a lazy kid who is rejected by everybody in the kokiri village. He dosent even have his own fairy. But as you progress through the story Link keeps getting stronger and stronger just enough to beat the next boss. Towards the mid point of the game where you get the ocarina of time Link finally meets ganandorf. Link With great courage draws his sword and weapon but is easily knocked off by ganandorf. Ganandorf then laughs and leaves in pursuit of the princess. Link has gotten strong but not nearly strong enough. The sages knew link could not take on ganon at this age so they put link into a deep 7 year sleep. Now Link (matured) has been informed what has happend to hyrule and now he must find all the sages in order to beat ganon and save hyrule. So link sets off running around hyrule, temple to temple gaining even more strength and weapons. In the end Link is now strong enough to face the evil lord in a epic showdown between shadow vs light, the hero of time who possesses the triforce of courage vs the evil demon king who possesses the triforce of power. After a long epic struggle Link the hero of time prevails and defeats Ganon stabbing him with the master sword in the head.

One of my friends said it perfectly when they said, \"Can you think of a better game at the time?\" My answer was \"No, good point.\" There are a few problems I had with it though. The game kept abruptly stopping due to major perplexity and frustration, which stems from a lack of explanation or some subtle detail that was understandably overlooked. The game required the Internet more times than it required the ocarina. The beginning was mundane and underwhelming, but that was understandable because it was basically a tutorial so it was only irritating while you were playing it. Also, the water temple is agreed by most to be lengthy, repetitive, discreet, drawn-out, and questionable why the iron boots must be taken on and off an endless amount of times. At least, they fixed that in the remake for the Nintendo 3DS. Also, the fairy won't shut up through the entire game. She, or he, or whatever, wasn't helpful and kept interrupting gameplay for obvious info about the game. The only time I got peace and quiet is when I fought Ganondorf or when I shut the system off. I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares about it. My favorite temple was the forest temple and the shadow temple. Both creative and large, much like the game. I mentioned all the game's flaws, and not a lot of its strong points. I don't mean to say the game is bad, hence the 8 I gave it.

First, congratulations. Second, back it up.

Back it up buddy.\n\nAnyhow, I first played this game when I was about 11 or 12 (back when it was released). Quite frankly, whenever I played a game i usually never finished it. I just didn't give a poop. Nothing ever grabbed me. And well guess what. This game did. For some odd reason, I really cared about the fate of Hyrule, and whether or not Link was gonna be okay fighting all these bad guys. Man I tore into this game. It sucked me right in. I've replayed it a dozen times since.\n\nI'm not a gamer by any stretch, nor do I even really care that much about video games. Certainly not Zelda. But this game really is an anomaly. It turns casual gamers into hard-core players, for all of 40 plus hours. It did for me anyhow.\n\nIf you find yourself, BORED in the game, take a look at if you get bored during other things, and maybe evaluate if it's actually the game that's boring or if it's just your attention span and imagination being very poor. If you don't have the capacity for make believe maybe video games, movies, or books aren't for you. This game is like reading a REALLY good long book. It takes a bit of an investment to complete it.

You have to kill spider creatures, and once you kill them a yellowish token will appear, you have to collect a bunch of them and give it to a cursed family.

It's a great game! However, there are a few flaws. Thankfully, those flaws don't mean you shouldn't pick the game up right now and play it! First of all, the shops. They serve absolutely no purpose. I have gotten through the whole game without ever buying anything unnecessary from the shops. I did need healing and magic, though, but you always have a fairy ready somewhere to trap in a jar, so that's the only heal you'll ever need. And you're always full on magic, except the last battle, so there's no use for the magic potions. As for the cold fire, spiders and fish, you get those too! I got a giant's wallet pretty early, but I was always full on rupees. I think I wasted about 4 times the rupees I actually got by just taking them while my wallet was full. Speaking of rupees, that renders the reward for the biggest collectathon ever absolutely useless! Like getting 99 lives in Mario 64. It was satisfying finding all the spiders. As for the last battle, it's disappointing, to say the least. You HAVE TO HAVE the magic upgrade, and you can't waste any magic on missing, or testing. If you run out of magic, you have to either reset or kill yourself, wasting all the fairies you saved for the battle. Ganon was ok, I guess. I only felt the need to use a bombchu once in the entire game, which was stupid considering how much attention is given to those things. Also, Navi and Kepora Gebora. Those are truly the only problems in the entire game. It was a visceral experience from start to finish. I loved the music, the battle system, the items, the characters, the weapons, the quests, everything. I especially loved how you can't miss ANYTHING! You can get absolutely everything, anytime you want! (Except after the final battle, but you don't need it then anyway). I loved playing the ocarina freestyle, so the scarecrow song was a really cool thing. The ending kinda made me sad. All those people you helped, met, loved, like they never knew you in the first place. Still, every Ocarina song will stay in my heart, I will never forget any of the beautiful melodies I was taught.

I'm getting to that.\nlets start this by saying I'm new to the N64 and the Zelda franchise, I bought my console and a bunch of games a couple of years ago because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about, \"ocarina of time\" this, \"goldeneye\" that. I thought i was really missing something, and i was! i have N64 parties and just play games all night, its loads of fun to just mariokart and goldeneye all night.\nBut this ocarina, I don't know about it. I was struggling to stay focused, the camera angles and ambiguous graphics, not to mention the outrageously laughable controller really takes it's toll on the fun-o-meter. i simply can't have fun when I'm frustrated with the basic elements of game design.\nThe point of a good game, i think, is to be good regardless of age. ultima 4, super mario bros. and populous weren't just good in the 80s, they are still classics and staples of good game design. nostalgia is not an adequate reason to be a great game. i played some games i thought were awesome as a child, and replaying them, I still enjoy them. But as i got older, i started breaking the mechanics and general game structure down and analyzing them, those games wouldn't really hold up. If i gave someone a copy of that game and told him it's the best game of all time, i don't think he would agree with me.\nBut anyway, aside from the obvious problems with camera angles and the god awful controls, which were far better than most N64 titles, i went on my way. I found the plot hooks very weak and unattractive, and the villain had very poor motivations. The dungeons were fairly easy, but there were some \"WTF that's what i supposed to do?\" moments, which are never good in any game. the combat mechanics, are surprisingly good! the programmers could wrestle with this beast of a controller and actually accomplish something nearly usable with it. so i appreciate the effort for that. most of the puzzles are fine, but some require trial-and-error to accomplish, which defeats the purpose of a puzzle, you may as well roll a die if that's how its going to work. the jumping puzzles sometimes like to bite you in the ass, but overall i've seen worse.\nIt's not that the game is bad, its not, its just not that good. its just OK. its just a run of the mill psuedo-rpg that lots of people happen to have nostalgic connection to. its got a charm to it that is matched by other games. The datedness of it gives a sterile and bland aura to it, buts that's just it. bland. I simply couldn't be bothered playing it anymore, it just got too unengaging and i just stopped playing and that was it.\noverall It's worth a try, maybe you will be one of the many followers of it, but this game has not aged well at all. But what do i know, go out there and find games you do like and stop reading this silly review.\nbut seriously, i enjoy listening to the music more than the game.\n9/10 music\n6/10 visuals\n8/10 game play\n6/10 story\n4/10 re-playability\n5/10 atmosphere\n6/10 controls", "points": 7}, {"text": "This is game is Insanely over-rated.

The other area where Zelda fails is the plot. When the first Zelda came out, the whole \"rescue the princess\" cliche was overused enough in games. Nintendo added time travel into the third Zelda, and here we are doing the same thing over and over. The plot is the same, the towns have the same names, and the music is the same!

Then what is my problem with this game? It's.. well...er...bland! Okay, there! I said it!

He travels through time and navigates various dungeons to awaken the sages, who have the power to seal Ganondorf away forever. Music plays an important role; to progress, the player must learn to play several songs on an ocarina.", "points": 8}, {"text": "First off, OoT begins with Link as a little boy. Know idea how old he is, but he seems to be around 7 or 8. Little fairy called Navi flies up to him and wakes him up for no reason. Apparently the world is in danger and this is just enough motivation to get the little tyke to wake up and start his day. Navi is a sort of tutorial person and she can be annoying if you already know what to do. But if you are like me and don't mind a refresher, Navi doesn't seem so obnoxious.\n\nSo Link wakes up and Navi basically explains the Deku Tree (the ONLY tree I know with a mustache) needs to see him. Now I as the player begin to move him around with the little joystick and make him run outside his little tree house. Looks like we're in a forest; the Kokiri Forest to be exact. First instinct is to explore around, learn how to pick up rocks and throw them, learn to break pots, run through grass to find stray rupees, and of course find out that Mido is a real jerk. Not sure how he does this, but he slides all the way around the area he is guarding and doesn't let you in because Link is \"different\" somehow. By the way, Mido is the leader of the Kokiri Forest children running around.\n\nA bit peeved, I run around looking for a sword and shield just like Navi told me to do after saying 'Hello' to Mido (ironically, Link cannot speak). As I find the sword and shield buy dodging rolling boulders and cutting people's lawns for any money I found, I noticed something strange. All these kids running around... not ONE. SINGLE. ADULT!! It was like watching Ed, Edd, and Eddy and wondering the same thing: who watches these children? Does anybody care at all what happens to them!? So I get the sword and shield and shove them in Mido's face and he begrudgingly lets me pass. Off to visit the Deku Tree!\n\nApparently this old sap was dying and I had to go inside his mouth and kill something to make him feel better. This is the first dungeon of the game. This is where the puzzle aspect comes into play. I was climbing webs, pushing blocks, looting chests, getting lost, freaking out at these huge spiders with skulls as abomens as they drop from the ceiling, and, my favorite hobby, burning things with sticks! Eventually I reached a point where I just couldn't go further. So, got lost again and bumped my head into a chest containing a slingshot. This slingshot was going to help further my progress by allowing me to shoot things from a safe distance.\n\nFinally found the last room where the apparent evil that was killing the Deku Tree was hiding and boy was it dark! Walking around cautiously I hear the same sound that the spiders made when they were moving. Of course, I look up to see if I was right... oh I was right alright. In fact, I was so right the game went widescreen, zoomed in on this spider and it reveals one big orange eye that glares at me with such contempt. The eight-legged freak drops from the ceiling and some white text appears: Parasitic Armored Arachnid GOHMA! I believed myself to be knee deep in scat at this point, so I ran around frantically hoping Navi would say something useful for once! Gohma gets close to me and stands upright, focusing a red glaring eye upon me. Navi finally uses her magical power to pause the game and hint that I should poke its eye. Really Navi? You want me to irritate this guy by poking it in the DAMN EYE!? Fine. I'll shoot a pebble in the eye and see if Gohma gets some more redness and asks Ben Stein for some eyedrops. Apparently shooting a slingshot hurt a lot more than I thought! Gohma falls down and her eye is flashing all sorts of colors. I pull out my twig-sized sword and hack away. Gohma gets back up after 4 slashes and we do this dance allover again. Run around, stand in fear as Gohma begins to stare into my soul with her crimson gaze, fling a pebble in her eye, watch her fall down, pull out twig, smack her with it, and then she dissipates.\n\nGot that out of the way, but apparently the Deku Tree's doctor only gave him so much time to live. In other words, I was too late. The tree was dying and he gives Link a Kokiri Emerald. I guess I should keep it. After all, it's a parting gift and it is shiny. But there is more to this game than just killing time in dungeons, solving puzzles, laying the smack down on spiders bigger than any boot you will ever find, and then watching the trees die! There are mini-games, sidequests, weapons galore, secrets, fairies, engrossing story developments, songs to play, adventures to be had, and NPCs who may strike you as odd, peculiar, creepy, and even pretty. The game's main mechanic has got to be the Ocarina of Time. It is used in many places to open doors, raise water levels, turn night into day, teleport Link to previous locations, and even make it rain! I would say more, but I don't want to spoil anything else.

The Great Deku Tree summons a fairy by the name of Navi to aid Link in his quest to save Hyrule from destruction. Navi finds LInk in his bed and tells him the Great Deku Tree has summoned him. Link agrees to visit the Great Deku Tree and learns that he has placed a curse on him by the main villain of the game, he is asked to remove the curse. Once Link removes the curse the Deku Tree tells him that Hyrule is in danger, he asks Link to find the princess of the land and begins his quest to save Hyrule.\n\nGameplay:\nYou begin the game with nothing in your inventory, you have to find a sword to fight your way through the monsters you encounter in the game along with a shield to go with it. You find rupees which are used as the currency in the game to buy items, this is very useful for buying potions and miscellaneous items such as deku sticks, nuts, seeds, and arrows to aid Link. The combat is very easy to learn right off the bat, you find a sword and can side slash, jump slash, or stab your opponents.\n\nThe game is open world with tons of collectibles to collect throughout, such as extra heart pieces, gold skulltullas to upgrade wallet capacity, and secret locations. You encounter dungeons you must to do progress the main game, every dungeon is enjoyable to play through, the puzzles are simple to learn, and the bosses are uniquely designed. At the end of each dungeon will earn an extra heart container to increase health capacity, plus you will earn an item that you need to progress. The Water Temple is the hardest dungeon in the game, the layout is confusing to learn, but nevertheless still very fun to play through every time.\n\nGraphics:\nThe game looks fantastic, it is beautiful to look at, much like Super Mario 64. The game can lag at times depending on what console you play on (Virtual Console, Gamecube, Nintendo 64, iQue), it is an old game after all.\n\nMusic:\nThe original score is just as great as any other Zelda game, being composed by Koji Kondo, his score is  as great as the previous games. The music sets the mood no matter where you are in the game, the score is one of the best in video game history.\n\nFinal Opinion:\nOcarina of Time is considered to be the greatest game ever made, there is so much to do in the game that it will keep you entertained all the way through.

The first major problem is the Water Temple as it is extremely confusing and requires so many keys to get into the multiple rooms. Also, the mini boss is much harder than the actual boss. Another problem I have with the game is that although all of the bosses in the game are good, not many stand out as interesting or unique. This doesn't mean they are bad however as some of them are brilliant like the sisters in the Spirit Temple and the Forest Temple boss but the others are mediocre or to simple like the first boss in the Deku Tree.\n\nThe positives however are that the world feels unique and lived in, unlike some that feel unrealistic. Everything you do feels important no matter what the task is as you are helping a world that you can care so much about. The items are all interesting with some of the most common items in there as well. I always love to play the ocarina as all the songs are different and are brilliantly composed but that is true with every piece of music and I would sometimes find myself whistling song's like Saria's song (The Lost Woods theme tune) or Gerudo Valleys theme tune. Hyrule field is a bit empty but is still a beautiful place to just walk or ride around in. I also like the controls and the Z targeting but sometimes you might do something you don't want to but that rarely happens when I play. The dungeons and temples are fun (except the Water Temple) as it puts puzzles in certain environments and can't be found in other areas.

There's a lot to love, here. I actually didn't play the game until I downloaded it on my Wii since I never owned an N64. By that time I was around 17 or so, just several years ago. Even for someone like me who's only playing it now, I can say the game was absolutely amazing. I may just be a jaded millennial, but I can definitely see why people loved this game so much. It really set the standard for what modern Zelda games are all about.\n\nIt goes through the same motions as all the others, of course. Go into a dungeon, get an item, use it to beat the boss. It's the standard thing that all Zelda games do over and over, but I'm not knocking points off of it because it did this first. Even if it wasn't the first to do it, I'd probably still love the game just as much. The world feels huge despite its actually relatively small size, feeling much larger and livelier than many of the much bigger open world games that I've played. There's tons to do, and no matter how many times I play the thing, I never find myself becoming bored. The world is fun to explore, and the dungeons are very well designed, never being a completely linear experience, but never feeling like it just leaves you without any clue as to what to do. I love exploring and figuring out the dungeons in this game, they're absolutely some of the best parts of the game. Of course I hear the Water Temple was some legendary rite of passage to separate the boys from the men, but I never found that much trouble with it. It was more complex than others, sure, but the same rules applied. Just explore rooms you haven't been to, yet. It wasn't really that difficult for me, even if it had three separate and sprawling floors.\n\nEven as someone who jumped onto Ocarina of Time late, I can still feel the magic in this title. I fell in love with the game after the first dungeon, and I felt compelled to keep going through the story, exploring the dungeons and slaying the monsters, and the second half of the game feels even better than the first half when you're jumping back and forth through time. Shifting from child to adult form is the main selling point of this game, and it's used to solve puzzles and such things in certain sections of the game. Although only one dungeon really incorporates it completely, it can be used in exploration throughout the world, and it's always fun to come across something and experiment with time to see what works.\n\nThis is my personal favorite Zelda title, though I haven't played all of them, but even so I don't think my opinion is controversial. This is definitely a masterpiece, and any shortcomings it may have are overshadowed by its overall amazing quality and the magical experience it provides, even after all the years after its initial release.", "points": 10}, {"text": "Just came here to pay my tribute to the best game ever made.

I think for a person that is not used to video games too much and does not want hyper-complex stories or super action games Zelda, and so especially Ocarina of Time is a great game with its solid gameplay, nice world, beautiful soundtrack and characters. I personally think the learning curve of the game is because of the clunkiness of the game and a few monsters not unfair but still not perfect. The dungeons at times are really not my thing. Many Zeldas have their \"stone wall rooms\" in their dungeons but this one here has really a lot of them with just a few details. You just feel that the dungeons basically are a few blocks of rock (except for the first three). I had a lot of fun with the Water and Spirit Temple nonetheless - yes the Water Temple, can you believe it and some of the most memorable moments in the franchises history are a part of this game in my opinion.\n\nEveryone who has not played this game shoud definitely do so.", "points": 10}, {"text": "little overrated but still one of the best Zelda games but still has problems like camera, and the pre rendered images look really bad, the mini games are awsome the ganon fight is awsome man !", "points": 8}, {"text": "The best game ever, in his time the game haven\u00b4t comparation with others games.

Ever since I first got into this game as a kid I was fascinated by the world, exploring everywhere not knowing where I was going or what to do. Despite this I was captured by the deepness the game had to offer by the expensive world alone...and I wouldn't even get into the story until almost a decade later. The game kept me busy, finding new places with seemingly no end in sight. I would often think the game had literally no end to it. After multiple times renting the game I would finally get a copy for my own eagerly on the Wii, wanting to experience the fullness of a game that I had adored....and I sure wasn't alone in that regard. What I had come to expect was beyond my expectations. I had already played Twilight Princess and that was already a classic to me, but Ocarina of Time went even further than that game could even achieve. The story is simple but well done. The gameplay is as good as it gets, with epic boss battles, clever and balanced puzzles, and an excellent level of challenge that is still unmatched by any game I've played thus far. The atmosphere this world gives is beyond words I could even put down. You want to save Zelda and defeat Ganondorf, and save Hyrule for all the characters you have met along the way and yourself as well. Items are endlessly interesting to discover and you would be surprised to find so many hidden places in one game. Its mind boggling. There are no places to get stuck at without clear and open thinking and exploration. The game doesn't drag on either as you are constantly surprised and interested to see what happens next. To date this is the only game I have ever spent 10 hours playing without stopping. I would never do that again, but that shows how addictive the game is. People say a game is never perfect. Well if this game isn't, it sure comes pretty darn close. I have yet to play a Link to the Past, but I truly do believe that if their is any game that can be called the greatest game ever made, this is one of those games that deserves it.

It's something you have to experience for yourself to understand what I mean. I know there are a lot of haters out there who automatically hate the game because of the praise it gets and I totally understand how something being so overrated can turn you off completely, I feel the same way about a lot of things. But before you make your final consensus, at least give the game 4 or 5 dungeons of your time before you truly decide it's not for you. And in the chance it's not for you at least you could give an educated reason why you don't like it instead of hating it because of the fan base.

Link's destiny is to defeat the evil Ganondorf (The Gerudo King) and save Princess Zelda. There is much to the story but I don't want to spoil too much.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay was pretty good for the most part, just gets extremely frusterating because of the lack of buttons on the N64 controller. I praise the Z-Targeting in the game as without it, it would be an extremely hard. The enemies that will piss you off the most are the bats and other flying creatures as they are the hardest to aim at.\n\nSound: I found OOT funny in the sense that Link always makes the HYAH HYEAH HEYA HUP for every action you do besides running or walking. Didn't come across too many SFX issues because everything I hit sounded exactly how I think it would sound in real life.\n\nMusic: This soundtrack is incredible. Its so memorable and I see how people can keep humming or whistling this song wherever you go. A personal favourite of mine is Kakoriko Town followed up by the Song of Storms song in the windmill (Both places centered around Kakoriko Town :D). I certainly can't wait to play Majoras Mask and see their memorable soundtracks too!!\n\nCharacters: 85% of characters are very minor and do nothing with the story, but they are memorable and you know what type of traits they carry. Like the couple swinging around in the Castle Marketplace which they do that 24/7 and never get tired. The only characters that you will probably remember are Zelda, Ganondorf and Mido that little prick.\n\nTextures/Graphics/Design: That true N64 look, reused textures and the polygonal shapes everywhere. It looks aged as of today, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking how mind-blowing it was back in the day, a truly wonderful and unique world.\n\nRandom Notes: Although I bought this game at a garage sale for fairly cheap (N64 version), you are best off emulating it or getting the 3DS version (Pirating is wrong mkay) the N64 title is highly demanded will cost a lot.\n\nDo you recommend? Yes\nHow long did it take you to beat? Approx. 25 hours (I collected a lot of items and did the side quests)\nWhat's the best part about the game? The soundtrack\nWhat's the worst part about the game? The **** bats\n\nOverall Ratings\n\nPlot: 9/10 (Reviewing like I am played it in 1998, its unfair to compare it to newer games)\nGameplay 8/10\nSound 9/10\nMusic 10/10\nCharacters 9/10\nTextures/Graphics/Design 9/10\n\nOverall 9/10\n\nAwesome game, will be playing Majora's Mask and it better be just as good as Ocarina of Time and I bet it will.", "points": 9}, {"text": "Truly a masterpiece!

In all my years of gaming, playing everything from CoD to Final Fight, from Banjo Kazooie to League of Legends, from Final Fantasy Tactics and Mother to Fallout III and Fire Emblem: Awakening, across two decades of gaming, there has never been a game as perfectly put together as this one. Every pixel in this game is a legacy in and of itself and leaves a truly lasting impression, a LANDMARK in the mind to any who have experienced it. What is there to say about this game, truly? Well simply put, it is a masterpiece. Like the Mona Lisa, or Michelangelo's David. A Truly beautiful work of art that deserves to be recognized with full acclaim as something that shaped the future of all art of its kind and stands to this day as a testimony to the power and creative spirit that goes into the creation of Video Games. The story is simple, though not as simple as it initially seems. The world is chalk full of hidden bits that scream of a deeper mysticism binding this world, from the simple and obvious Hyrule Field skeletons to the subtle and beautiful spinning of the whimsical-but-also-dark Windmill Hut, appropriately dubbed \"?\". The music is simply majestic, from the haunting trills of the Forest Temple and its distorted Link screams to the fantastic, iconic... LEGENDARY ocarina songs. The graphics were unbelievable for the time... and honestly... the only part that doesn't hold up to this day is the texture resolution as the models are decent. They're  not cutting edge, but everything animates smoothly and looks nice, with smooth arcs, etc. The story is classic, iconic... legendary.. and even takes a decent amount of twisting and turning. The gameplay is immaculate and perfectly executed, with the series' best (in my opinion) puzzles combined with the smooth and fantastic difficulty curve lead the player to be immersed in the pleasing swordplay and item based advancement.\n\nIn short, Ocarina of Time still holds up to this day, standing the test of time to be, in this humble player's opinion, still the greatest game ever made.

The boss (Dark Link, Phantom Ganon, Twinrova to name a few) fights were all unique.\n\nMost of all, the ocarina songs were all memorable and much better than the ones in the newer games.

There's probably more but you get the point.\n\nI could write pages and pages about this game but there's no point. I've played hundreds and hundreds of games over the course of several decades and I still love this game.

This is something I've tried with other games but sadly they have not withstood the test of time anywhere near as well.\n\nThere are aspects to this game that developers should be using for their games today - an example of this is the levelling system. No need to for XP bars, skill trees or any of that nonsense. Just keep it simple. You're health goes up slowly as you make progress but doubly as you explore more areas and find secrets. You find new items which reward you with new abilities. It's all you need. Levelling shouldn't be a big deal and should basically be invisible to the player.\n\nAnyways, there's only a few reasons why you would be reading my review;\n1. You've played the game and like it - hello (see '2' if you're looking to play it again).\n\n2. You haven't played the game - then I suggest you get the 3DS version. It's the best legitimate version available. If you don't want that then you can get it on the Wii eShop. I'll also remind you that the WiiU has a Wii inside it [not everyone knows this]. So yes, you can play OoT on your WiiU but you'll need an old controller.\n\n3.

This is a spoiler free review.  To keep it as spoiler free as possible im going to be somewhat brief. This game is a perfect example of overcoming forces that you previously would not be able to overcome. its a story of triumph, much like any other zelda game. However, this one is special. Ocarina of Time is a pioneer of the genre. being arguably one of the most innovative games of all time being the first 3D Adventure game, as well as bringing Z-targeting to the table, that every game nowadays uses in one form or another. This game has a special way of immersing you into it and taking you for the rollercoaster the game is. Plot twists and all, If you even dare to consider yourself a gamer this is a must play, otherwise you are missing out on what will be known as the best game of all time for years to come. if a game is ever to come that is greater than that of Ocarina, i will be swept off my feet.\n\nConclusion:  No matter what blocks you from playing this game, get through it. play it somehow one way or another. whether on the N64, Gamecube, Wii virtual console, 3DS anything. just please do not emulate this game because this is a game worthy of being paid for.", "points": 10}, {"text": "Ocarina of Time is a revolutionary game, crafted with such perfection and precision only Nintendo can deliver!, the first Zelda game i played was Ocarina of Time 3D for the 3DS, i fell in love with it instantly!", "points": 10}]
